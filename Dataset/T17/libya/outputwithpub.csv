2011-02-16,"Source : Several people arrested after police confronted protesters in Benghazi , Libya In Yemen , calls for better curriculum turns into an anti-government protest In Bahrain , protesters camp out at a landmark In Iran , thousands turn out for a funeral of man claimed by both sides For all the latest developments in the Middle East , tune in to '' AC360 , '' weeknights at 10 ET . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Unprecedented demonstrations sweeping the Middle East and North Africa spread Wednesday to Libya , where police clashed with anti-government protesters in the coastal city of Benghazi , an independent source told CNN . 
About 200 protesters came out to show support for human rights activist and lawyer Fathi Terbil , who had been detained earlier , the source said . 
Several people were arrested after police confronted the protesters , the source added . 
But Libya -- ruled by Moammar Gadhafi since 1969 -- is not Egypt , said a highly placed Libyan source close to the government who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media . 
`` There is nothing serious here , '' he said . 
`` These are just young people fighting each other . '' 
Driven by discontent and fueled by social media , protests in the region spread this week not just to Libya but to Iran and Bahrain . 
Anti-government sentiment has also manifested itself on the streets of Algeria , Jordan , Syria and Yemen . 
In Yemen , Sanaa University students protested Wednesday , calling for an improved curriculum , but the demonstration rapidly morphed into an anti-government stand . 
Participants said government supporters outside the university gates hurled rocks , but the situation stayed under control . 
It was at least the sixth day that scuffles had broken out between the government 's supporters and foes . 
Activist Abdul Rahman Barman said three anti-government protesters were injured when government supporters attacked them after the demonstration . 
One had to be hospitalized for head injuries , he said . 
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power for 32 years but has pledged not to run for re-election when his current term ends in 2013 . 
In nearby Bahrain , thousands of people marched in a peaceful funeral procession for Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima , who was killed when clashes erupted during the funeral for another protester . 
They camped out at the Pearl Roundabout , a landmark in the capital , Manama , that has been adopted by protesters as their Tahrir Square , the epicenter of Egypt 's revolution . 
A massive pearl sits at the apex of a circle of inward-sweeping arches , and Wednesday , Bahrainis camped out at its base and painted anti-government slogans . 
Later in the day , flag-waving pro-government demonstrators were out in Manama and the second largest city of Muharraq . 
New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof said security forces have backed off after `` a concerted deliberate effort to use a truly stunning amount of force . '' 
`` Now that the regime has backed off , it 's a little hard to say where things will go , '' Kristof told CNN . 
`` It is possible that ... there will be some kind of truce and agreement to have more democracy , some more concessions . '' 
Large crowds showed up for a funeral as well in the Iranian capital , where 26-year-old Saneh Jaleh was laid to rest . 
Iranian authorities said Jaleh belonged to the pro-government Basij militia and was shot to death by the outlawed People 's Mujahedeen of Iran . 
But some of Jaleh 's acquaintances disputed that account , and Jaleh 's funeral strangely drew both supporters and foes of the Islamic regime , which has cracked down on dissent even though it publicly praised Egyptians for toppling President Hosni Mubarak . 
International journalists are barred from covering Iran 's unrest , but a protester told CNN that police fired tear gas and beat people with batons . 
Sara , whose full name has been withheld for security reasons , said she was risking her safety to march on the streets because Jaleh was part of Iran 's reformist Green Movement . 
`` We are not allowing his blood to go to waste , '' she said . 
`` I am doing this for him . '' 
In the place that gave rise to the spirit of the region 's freedom movement , changes were still slowly unfolding . 
Tunisia lifted its midnight-until-4 a.m. curfew , though a state of emergency remains intact , the state-run Tunis Afrique Presse said . 
Weeks of demonstrations forced the ouster of longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January . 
`` Tunisia now after the revolution of its population is now searching for its independence , '' said Lazhar Samali , an engineer who protested against the government . 
`` It 's a sovereign state , and Tunisia has in its own hands its destiny . '' 
The end of Ben Ali 's 23-year rule inspired Egyptians , and then others , to rise up for their rights . 
Last Friday , after 18 days of mass demonstrations in Egypt , Mubarak stepped down , leaving the nation in the hands of its powerful military .

2011-02-18,"By the CNN Wire Staff A still from an undated video released February 17 , 2011 via YouTube allegedly shows protesters destroying a monument of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's Green book . 
Witness says square in Benghazi is full of protesters , but there is little sign of police or military Tanks surrounded demonstrators in Benghazi , a protester says 50 reportedly killed since Tuesday , 20 of them Friday U.S. president condemns the government crackdowns in Libya , Bahrain and Yemen -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 20 people were killed and 200 more were injured Friday in the northern Mediterranean city of Benghazi , Libya 's second-largest , said a medical source in Benghazi who was not identified for security reasons . 
The casualties occurred as thousands of Libyans took to the streets to voice their discontent over leader Moammar Gadhafi , witnesses said . 
Friday 's killings brought to 50 the number of people killed since Tuesday , when the protests began , the medical source said . 
Amnesty International said security forces had killed at least 46 during the past three days , with sources at al-Jala Hospital in Benghazi saying that the most common injuries were bullet wounds to the head , chest and neck . 
Protester : Thousands in Libya 's streets Protests , arrests continue in Libya Libya 's turn to topple a dictator ? 
Did WikiLeaks help spawn Libyan unrest ? 
CNN was unable to independently verify the information . 
In front of the main courthouse in a square in Benghazi , thousands of demonstrators filled the streets demanding a change of government , a protester said . 
He said people were chanting for Gadhafi and his children to get out of Libya . 
He called Gadhafi 's authoritarian rule `` the biggest dictatorship in history . '' 
Late Friday , a witness said more people were still streaming into the already crowded plaza , with some erecting tents , apparently planning to spend the night . 
There was no sign in the square of police or military forces except for the presence of three tanks , which were not moving , he said . 
Another source said that he saw three Libyan army tanks in the square and that young demonstrators were engaging the tank crews in conversation . 
He said government forces were not visible in or around Benghazi . 
He added that he visited Al-Jala hospital and that it was `` full of dead and wounded . '' 
Electricity was lost in parts of the city but had been restored by late Friday , when the city was quiet , he said . 
Farther east , in al-Baida , thousands of people showed up to bury 13 protesters killed in clashes in recent days , said Mohamed Abdallah of the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya , who has been receiving information about Libya from sources there . 
Plainclothes members of the Revolutionary Committee had reportedly fired at the protesters , Abdallah said . 
Demonstrations unfolded Friday in other cities as well , he said . 
CNN has not been permitted to report from Libya and can not confirm information about the demonstrations . 
The government maintains tight control of the news media and telephone services , and many people expressed fear of talking openly amid what they described as a climate of fear . 
CNN has been relying on information from protesters , human rights groups and foreign-based Libyan organizations assessing the situation through their sources on the ground . 
Libyan state-run television was airing taped images of Gadhafi surrounded by adoring crowds . 
The demonstrations erupted Tuesday after the detention of a human rights lawyer and spread across the country . 
U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the government crackdowns in Libya , Bahrain and Yemen , which are all embroiled in unrest . 
`` Wherever they are , people have certain universal rights , including the right to peaceful assembly , '' Obama said . 
`` The United States urges the governments of Bahrain , Libya and Yemen to show restraint in responding to peaceful protests , and to respect the rights of their people . '' 
`` The security forces ' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Moammar Gadhafi 's brutal rule when faced with any internal dissent , '' said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East and North Africa director for Human Rights Watch . 
Navi Pillay , the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , also condemned the crackdown in Libya and other countries `` as illegal and excessively heavy-handed . '' 
Abdallah , the spokesman for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya , reported that protesters in Benghazi had freed people who had been detained during the first two days of the unrest . 
He said protesters also set afire a police station and the Revolutionary Committee headquarters in Benghazi , al-Baida and Darna . 
Gadhafi 's regime , however , has sought to portray a different picture of events and sent out tacit warnings via mobile phone texts to Libyans planning to make their voices known . 
`` The inappropriate use of telecommunications services contradicts our religion ... our customs ... and our traditions , '' said a text from the General Communications Body . 
Another said : `` We commend the conscious youth who have realized that sedition destroys his family , his city , his country . 
And we commend our cities who have realized that touching national unity destroys the prospects of future generations . 
Together for the sake of the Libya of Tomorrow . '' 
A screen grab of the messages was sent to CNN by Abdulla Darrat , spokesman of Enough Gadhafi , a U.S.-based organization that has been in close touch with people on the streets of Libya . 
State-run television countered the anti-government protests with coverage of pro-Gadhafi demonstrations . 
It showed men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans , waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader 's limousine as it crept through Tripoli . 
Scores of supportive demonstrators packed the roadway and held up pictures of their leader as fireworks burst into the night sky . 
The images followed reports from protesters , witnesses and human rights activists who described brutality by internal security forces , sometimes dressed in plain clothes . 
One of the protesters likened the situation in Libya to that which occurred early this month in Egypt , telling Human Rights Watch that `` they are sending baltaqiyyas -LRB- thugs -RRB- to beat us . '' 
Libya , like many of its Arab neighbors , is suffering from economic hardship and a lack of political reform . 
Youth unemployment is high . 
Gadhafi is acutely aware of popular grievances and has spoken with groups of students , lawyers and journalists in the past few weeks , a source told CNN this week .

2011-02-18,"Garbage containers are set on fire as Iranian protesters stage an anti-government demonstration on February 14 , 2011 . 
An Iranian opposition member warns that street protests could lead to civil war `` Nastaran '' warns that protests are strengthening Iran 's Revolutionary Guard and pro-government militia `` Nastaran '' says many Iranians will not accept a religious figure as the new leader of Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Iranian supporter of the country 's opposition movement has warned that continued anti-government street protests could lead to civil war . 
The woman , a 34-year-old jewelry designer who lives in Tehran , issued the warning in a series of emailed answers to questions put to her by CNN . 
The woman does n't want her real name revealed due to fear of retribution so has asked that we call her Nastaran . 
Does Iran 's opposition movement want regime change or just more freedom from this regime ? 
-LRB- The -RRB- separation of religion from politics . 
As long as religious leaders do n't interfere with politics , I do n't see a regime change as necessary . 
However , I doubt that the religious leaders would be willing to accept this . 
What kind of real change does the opposition movement hope to accomplish with street protests ? 
Nastaran : I completely disagree with the continuation of street protests . 
We are walking towards a civil war by asking people to pour into the streets and fight with empty hands . 
The regime will not step back and will kill as many people as it deems necessary to stay in power . 
Fight over Iran protest deaths Civil war is not the way . 
We need a change in strategy . 
I think by not changing the strategy and constantly asking people to get into the streets -LRB- especially in the same location -RRB- we are empowering Sepah -LRB- Iran 's Revolutionary Guard -RRB- and the Basij -LRB- Pro-government militia -RRB- . 
It is evident when you go on the streets during the protests that they have learned how to organize and mobilize better . 
Further , we are helping them to expand their army . 
How afraid are you of Iran 's security forces and their threats ? 
Nastaran : Extremely scared !! They are merciless and will do anything in the name of religion . 
The legal framework of Iran is also being ignored so they can accuse you of anything and perhaps kill you . 
Are Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi the leaders of Iran 's opposition movement ? 
Nastaran : To me they are not . 
To me they became leaders through people 's anger and dissatisfaction with the regime . 
However , I believe that every movement and uprising requires a leader and at this point in time there is no one better than them . 
The regime will not step back and will kill as many people as it deems necessary to stay in power . 
I do not accept them as leaders because I generally disagree with their ideologies . 
Further , I think they are not the right leaders for a large portion of our population . 
Many Iranians will always believe that these guys are part of the system and will refuse to support them . 
Many Iranians will not accept a religious figure , some one with a turban on their head as a leader , given their experience in the past 30 years . 
What does Iran 's opposition movement want from America right now ? 
What do you want President Obama to do ? 
Nastaran : Direct interference -LRB- from -RRB- America is not helpful . 
Iranians are prone to conspiracy theories and history has proven that American interference is not to our benefit . 
28 Mordad is a prime example -LRB- the 1953 U.S.-backed coup that overthrew Iran 's democratically elected government -RRB- . 
As a result , the masses tend to not want to follow any movement that is initiated or assisted by Americans . 
Their help should be indirect , but their help can be valuable . 
An example would be creating infrastructure for Iranians to more freely communicate , have access to information and spread the information . 
Additionally , appropriate sanctions can be useful also . 
However , they should be the type of sanctions that the regime would n't be able to blame for the people 's unhappiness and poverty . 
I think -LRB- that -RRB- until people really feel hungry and see that different economic and foreign policies will mean more comfortable lives , they wo n't join any kind of a movement . 
Intelligent sanctions can result in the latter .

2011-02-19,"By the CNN Wire Staff Word from inside Libya of more protests NEW : A protester in Benghazi says ranks have swelled ; a major rally is set for Sunday NEW : Libya 's official news agency says Israeli-led network is stirring unrest in Arab world An Army official siding with the opposition says government `` caused a massacre '' Libyan government 's tight controls make it difficult to verify information -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyans opposed to longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi vowed to hit the streets again Sunday , saying a violent crackdown by security forces since demonstrations began last week has energized their ranks . 
Benghazi , the North African nation 's second-largest city and hub of its eastern province , was home to some of the bloodiest clashes Saturday . 
Still , an anti-government demonstrator there said that despite having been barraged for days by tear gas and bullets , many of his colleagues slept overnight outside the city 's courthouse and planned another rally at 1 p.m. Sunday . 
`` There are a lot of people getting killed for their freedom , '' the man , who was not identified for safety reasons , told CNN early Sunday . 
`` Our goal is simple : We want Gadhafi to leave . 
... We want democracy . '' 
The man , a technology expert who has set up cameras airing live online video streams around Benghazi , estimated that the numbers of anti-government demonstrators in the city has grown 20 % since the protests began Tuesday . 
Another protester in Misratah , a city about 250 km -LRB- 155 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , said that roughly 1,300 remained on the streets there through the night and into the morning Sunday , burning pictures of Gadhafi and calling for an end to his rule . 
Libya 's turn to topple a dictator ? 
Understanding Mideast and African unrest CNN could not independently confirm information on the escalating unrest in Libya , the most isolated nation in the region , though it has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . 
The government has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country and maintains tight control over communications . 
Instead , a report from Libya 's state-run JANA news agency blames `` acts of sabotage and burning '' on outsiders aiming to undermine the nation 's stability , security and unity . 
The report claims that the unrest has been fomented in Libya as well as Tunisia , Morocco , Sudan , Egypt , Lebanon and Iran by an Israeli-led network of covert operatives . 
Since Wednesday , authorities have arrested `` dozens of foreign members of this network who were trained on starting clashes , '' the JANA story said , adding that the outsiders were of Tunisian , Egyptian , Sudanese , Turkish , Palestinian and Syrian descent . 
Meanwhile , the toll from the unrest continued to mount Saturday . 
While Human Rights Watch , citing interviews with hospital staff and witnesses , reported 84 deaths since Tuesday , the total number is unknown and could n't be independently confirmed by CNN . 
Medical sources at Misratah Medical Complex said that at least three died and 70 were wounded in clashes Saturday between security forces and anti-government protesters . 
Three of those injured are in critical condition , the sources said . 
A doctor treating the injured in Benghazi 's Al Jala hospital said that at least 30 people died Saturday , most from gunshot wounds to the head . 
Hovering helicopters fired into the crowds and the hospital was receiving a steady stream of injured people , said the doctor , who CNN is also not identifying for security reasons . 
His count did not include casualties from a clash between the protesters on the funeral march and soldiers at a military camp . 
Soldiers there fired tear gas and guns ; the protesters hurled rocks and at least two hand grenades , witnesses said . 
`` The situation is critical right now , '' said the doctor . 
`` The city is effectively under siege . '' 
Lt. Col. Mohammed al-Majbari , who helped lead Libyan military forces in Benghazi before deciding early this week to join the opposition , claimed that government forces , aided by mercenaries from other African countries , `` caused a massacre . '' 
`` It is time for freedom , '' al-Majbari said . '' 
-LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- is not a human being . 
A Libyan would never do this to his people . 
He is a dictator . '' 
The United States urges the governments of Bahrain , Libya and Yemen to show restraint in responding to peaceful protests Several eyewitnesses told CNN that cars of riflemen drove past protesters , indiscriminately firing at them . 
A Libyan woman supportive of the protesters , who was not identified to protect her safety , told CNN that army soldiers on Saturday initially claimed solidarity with the demonstrators , only to reverse their tack and open fire on the crowd . 
`` The soldiers ... said , ` We are with you . ' 
We believed them , '' she said . 
`` After that , they started shooting the people . 
Why did they lie ? '' 
Other eyewitnesses told CNN that anti-government demonstrators used a bulldozer Saturday to tear down part of a wall at Alfadeel Abu-Omar military camp , and were fired upon as they retreated . 
Many were hit by mortar and automatic weapon fire , the witnesses said . 
`` We are peaceful people , '' the technology expert said early Sunday from Benghazi . 
`` They are killing unarmed civilians . '' 
Others in Libya reported similar protests in the cities of al-Baida , Ajdabiya and significantly in Misratah -- an indication that the demonstrations centered in the east were spreading west . 
Anti-government protesters leaving noon prayers Saturday at Misratah 's Al-Sheikh mosque were confronted by pro-Gadhafi demonstrators , two witnesses told CNN . 
Security forces stepped in , firing tear gas to disperse the crowds . 
After the anti-government group moved to another square , security forces fired into the crowd , one protester said . 
A protester , identified only as Moftah , told CNN that Libyans , inspired by the toppling of dictators in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia , had simply had enough of Gadhafi . 
`` He will tell you that his secret police are everywhere , '' Moftah said . 
`` It 's time to break this fear barrier . 
We reach a point that we do n't care anymore . '' 
A Libyan source in exile , who has knowledge of events inside the country , said Saturday that the government was bringing in special military units . 
He said anti-Gadhafi factions now `` control '' increasing parts of eastern Libya , aided by `` police and security forces there -LRB- who -RRB- also belong to tribes . '' 
To counter that , the government is using `` military squads of African origin , '' the source said , voicing the same claim made by Majbari . 
`` They are not restricted or bound by tribal ties , '' and can therefore be better counted on to suppress the opposition . 
`` Violence in the east will escalate because of the tribal mentality of revenge , '' the source said , claiming reports of violence there had already fueled sporadic demonstrations in western Libya . 
Gadhafi 's regime , however , has sought to portray a different picture of events . 
Having previously aired extensive footage of pro-Gadhafi rallies in Tripoli , a Libyan state television program on Saturday described the anti-government protests as acts of sabotage . 
The report claimed that hospitals , banks , courthouses , prisons , security centers and military police headquarters had been burned , showing videos of buildings on fire and the aftermath of destroyed and scorched locales . 
The anchor said that security forces had managed to arrest dozens of people , claiming they were part of a foreign network of agitators trained to spark clashes and create chaos . 
The official Jamahiriya News Agency also reported that Gadhafi had spoken in recent days with fellow leaders from Guinea , Liberia and Yemen . 
The government also sent out , via text , a tacit warning against `` the inappropriate use of telecommunications services -LRB- that -RRB- contradict our religion ... our customs ... and our traditions . '' 
Internet service in Libya shut down Friday evening , though it was more available by Sunday . 
The government 's firm grip on power heightened the concerns of a woman from Benghazi , who urged U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders to help the Libyan people in the face of the government crackdown . 
`` We have no freedom here , '' she said . 
`` I speak to all the world , to America , to Mr. Obama : Please help us . 
We -LRB- did -RRB- nothing . 
We want to live a good life . ''

2011-02-20,"By the CNN Wire Staff Demonstrators occupy housing project in January Gadhafi responds with a $ 24 billion fund for housing and development Days after ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Libyans call for protests in their country Six days later , hundreds have been injured or killed in clashes -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pro-democracy movements that have swept across the Middle East and North Africa began to reach Libya in January , when demonstrators broke into a housing project the government was building and occupied it . 
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's government responded with a $ 24 billion fund for housing and development . 
More demonstrations were sparked when police detained relatives of those killed in an alleged 1996 massacre at the Abu Salim prison , according to Human Rights Watch . 
High unemployment has also fueled the protests , as have anti-Gadhafi groups . 
Here 's a timeline of events : Three days after the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , calls go out on Facebook for peaceful demonstrations in Libya against leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
Roughly 200 protesters take to the streets in the coastal city of Benghazi to show support for lawyer and human rights activist Fathi Terbil , according to witnesses . 
Several are arrested amid confrontations with police . 
A highly placed source close to the Libyan government tells CNN , `` there is nothing serious here . 
These are just young people fighting each other . '' 
State-run media reports that the government has released 110 political prisoners and that a committee would be convened to consider major changes to the government . 
Calls are posted on websites for a `` Day of Rage '' on what is the five-year anniversary of an incident in which security forces killed at least a dozen protesters . 
Seven people are killed in clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters , according to medical sources . 
Raucous pro-government demonstrators take to the streets in the nation 's capital in support of Gadhafi , witnesses say . 
Images from state television , labeled as `` live , '' feature men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans , waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader 's limousine as it creeps through Tripoli . 
In Benghazi , human rights groups and protesters claim they 're under attack by pro-government security forces . 
Among the tens of thousands of protesters who take to the streets , at least 20 people are killed and 200 are wounded , according to medical sources . 
Protests continue to turn violent , however the death and injury toll is unclear . 
In Benghazi , witnesses report bloody clashes with soldiers firing tear gas and bullets . 
A doctor treating the injured at Al Jala hospital says at least 30 people are dead , most of them from gunshot wounds to the head . 
Witnesses say protests have erupted in cities across the country , including al-Baida , Ajdabiya and Misratah , where anti-government protesters leaving noon prayers at a local mosque were confronted by demonstrators supportive of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
Human Rights Watch reports that 84 people have been killed in Libyan demonstrations since Tuesday . 
The organization bases that estimate on telephone calls made to medical providers across the country . 
Violence surges in Benghazi where eyewitness say protesters have taken control of the city and much of Tripoli . 
Gadhafi 's son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , appears on state television to warn demonstrators that if their protests do not subside , the country could fall into a civil war . 
"
2011-02-20,"By the CNN Wire Staff Experts and critics say freedom and basic rights in Libya remain widely restricted under Gadhafi 's rule . 
Moammar Gadhafi led a military coup in 1969 that began in Benghazi He now faces his first real popular unrest in 42 years centered in Benghazi Gadhafi has been controversial internationally and has become more a statesman lately His government has restricted communication and freedom , experts and critics say -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi 's first grab at power occurred 42 years ago in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi , when he led a crew of fellow military officers in taking over key government institutions on his way to usurping the nation 's monarchy . 
Ever since , he 's referred to himself as the Leader of the Revolution -- though politically , at least , Libya has appeared to be largely stable , with few threats to Gadhafi 's power . 
But that all changed this past week , with reports that tens of thousands took to the streets calling for an end to Gadhafi 's rule . 
And , once again , that change began in Benghazi . 
CNN has been unable to independently confirm information on the escalating unrest in Libya , the most isolated nation in the region . 
The government has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country and maintains tight control over communications . 
Still , phone interviews with witnesses and others on the ground suggest that some of Gadhafi 's strongest opposition has been in Benghazi , where protests began and have escalated . 
Since then , there have been indications that the opposition movement has spread westward toward the capital Tripoli . 
Why Gadhafi suddenly came under fire after decades of a strong-handed , seemingly stable rule remains a question . 
Protester : ` We want our basic rights ' One obvious factor is that Libya borders Tunisia , where popular unrest last month helped unseat authoritarian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after more than two decades in power . 
Weeks later , a similar movement contributed to the end of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's 30-year rule . 
Gadhafi is far from alone now . 
Anti-government protests have popped up all around the Arab world , with pressure growing on powerful leaders in places like Bahrain , Yemen and Algeria . 
But what makes Libya unique , in large part , is its colorful , controversial and powerful leader . 
Gadhafi was a captain in Libya 's army when , on September 1 , 1969 -- which is referred to as Revolution Day in Libya -- he and others launched the coup by assuming control of key institutions in Benghazi . 
The overthrow was completed in two hours , according to GlobalSecurity.org , an independent provider of security information . 
At the time , the United States had military aircraft at Wheelus Air Base in Libya . 
And Washington did not initially oppose the coup , a 2008 Congressional Research Service report noted . 
Gadhafi soon established himself as one of America 's most vocal , and flamboyant , enemies . 
By 1972 , Gadhafi urged Muslims to fight the United States and Great Britain and vowed support for black revolutionaries in America . 
The next year , he launched a program `` to destroy imported ideologies , whether they are Eastern or Western , '' a U.S. State Department timeline noted . 
In 1979 , the U.S. designated Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism . 
The relationship only worsened in the 1980s , when U.S. military aircraft shot down two Libyan fighter jets . 
Libya 's alleged attacks in Sudan , support for Nicaragua 's Sandanista government and role in the bombing of a West Berlin nightclub only further stoked the ire of the administration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan , who called Gadhafi a `` mad dog . '' 
Libya 's standing took a turn with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , killing 270 people . 
World pressure intensified on Tripoli after Libyan intelligence agents were implicated . 
By 1993 , Gadhafi told the International Herald Tribune that he was taking a more conciliatory approach to world affairs . 
He called U.S. President Bill Clinton `` the savior of the new world , '' and decried Islamic militants as `` mad dogs '' and `` terrorists . '' 
Clinton continued to keep pressure on Libya , signing a law imposing sanctions on companies that invested more than $ 40 million in that nation 's petroleum industry . 
By 1999 , Libya finally agreed to transfer the Pan Am 103 suspects for a trial in the Netherlands , leading to their conviction two years later . 
While still known for sometimes unconventional comments , Gadhafi appeared to evolve into more of a statesman -- at least internationally . 
In 2009 , he was elected by member states as head of the African Union . 
That year , he also addressed the United Nations ' General Assembly for the first time . 
Still , he proved to be more a firebrand than an even-keeled diplomat , delivering a blistering , wide-ranging 96-minute rant . 
His topics ranged from the U.N. Security Council to the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy to a one-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians : Isratine . 
Gadhafi blamed the U.N. for failing to prevent 65 wars since its founding in 1945 . 
But he also had kind words for U.S. President Barack Obama : `` We are content and happy if Obama can stay forever as the president of America , '' Gadhafi said . 
While Gadhafi seemed to take on a new role internationally , the world had few insights into what was happening inside Libya itself . 
Even as the U.N. , the United States and other nations gradually began to soften their stance on Libya , reports suggested that freedom and basic rights remained widely restricted under Gadhafi . 
`` He has n't changed , '' said Fouad Ajami , a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies . 
`` This is a monster . 
And the Libyan people are suffering from this . '' 
The government maintained a tight control over its communications , clamping down on news accounts critical of Gadhafi and his colleagues . 
It also restricted outside media access , including denying repeated requests from CNN to enter the country this month . 
On Friday night , Libyan authorities shut down the nation 's access to the internet , the U.S.-based tech firm Arbor Networks reported . 
While there have been indications of spotty Web coverage since , Libya sent out a text message warning about the `` inappropriate use of telecommunications services . '' 
Internal political dissent was largely and often violently squashed . 
Moftah , an anti-government protester who did not give his full name for security reasons , said Gadhafi `` always plays on fear '' -- relying on a broad network of intelligence agents , secret police and others . 
`` He makes you afraid of your family , of your friends , '' Moftah told CNN . 
`` He will tell you that his secret police are everywhere . '' 
And yet , despite the odds , people have still risen up this month against Gadhafi . 
For years , Libya profited greatly from its vast oil reserves . 
One of Gadhafi 's first orders of business after taking over was to assume control of properties and other interests of international petroleum companies . 
Still , even the great wealth of oil could n't change the fact that Libya has suffered in the recent global economic downturn . 
As in much of the Arab world , youth unemployment is high in Libya -- and most of the population has never known a leader other than Gadhafi . 
And the fact it began in Benghazi , despite the Libyan leader 's early history , is not a surprise , said Dirk Vandewalle , an associate professor at Dartmouth and author of `` A History of Modern Libya . '' 
He noted that the coastal city has traditionally been seen as somewhat disloyal to Gadhafi 's regime . 
Whether the Libyan demonstrators can follow the leads of their Arab colleagues in Tunisia and Egypt remains to be seen . 
If they do , they will have to overcome a cult of personality -- much like prevailed in those countries -- without having any fallback as far as political institutions or legislation to build off should they succeed . 
Unlike Egypt , Libya has no constitution , established institutions or any kind of mechanisms in place to support a new nation . 
The nation and its leader are one . 
`` In Libya , '' Vandewalle said , `` there is nothing beyond Gadhafi and his close circle . ''

It is in the best interest of Egypt and its neighbors to have a pro-American government that is good to its people while at the same time an enemy to terrorists . 
Iran is terrorist friendly and has indirectly caused loss of American lives ; to use your terminology , Iran does `` butt in other '' people 's business . 
This does not bother you because you hate America , its people , and its military . 
You will NEVER denounce the true enemy . 
And so I put it to you my fellow Americans , let us continue to make our presence known as a friend to democracy and an enemy of oppression and terrorism . 
Make no mistake , our journey will continue . 
Let those true to the people be our friend . 
By the same token , that those oppressive dictators and countries be an enemy not only to their own people , but to the American people as well . 
Freedom for all , thank you ! 
Gee whiz Phunnie boy , if you want to display your arrogance and self righteousness about the right of the U.S. to butt into the affairs of other countries , at least quit using my name to do it , will you ? 
Enough is enough !!! February 21 , 2011 at 12:12 am | Report abuse | I find it disgusting how people clinging to state power always refer to their own political views as `` the country '' . 
So when Saif Gaddafi says Libya , its cristal clear he means his father . 
In Venezuela something similar happens when `` chavistas '' speak of us , `` el pueblo '' ; they usually mean whatever part we should play in their political delusions . 
I gather that social networks are now a tool for people to resist this sort of governmental mis-representations . 
Does anyone know what role are these playing in Libya 's state of affairs ?

2011-02-20,"RABAT | Sun Feb 20 , 2011 6:47 pm EST RABAT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi promised a program of reforms on Sunday after bloody protests against his father 's rule reached the capital . 
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi , who has in the past pushed a reform agenda in Libya with only limited success , also hit out at those behind the violence , which has cost more than 200 lives over the past few days , according to human rights groups . 
He said protests against his father 's rule , which have been concentrated in the east of the country , threatened to sink Libya into civil war and split the country up into several small states . 
Saif al-Islam also acknowledged -- in the first such admission by a Libyan official -- that the police and army made mistakes in dealing with the protests . 
But he said reports of hundreds killed were an exaggeration . 
He said the General People 's Congress , Libya 's equivalent of a parliament , would convene on Monday to discuss a `` clear '' reform agenda , while the government would also raise wages .

U.S. authorities were keeping a close watch on Libya 's rapidly unfolding political crisis Monday , in part to see what possibilities might exist for meaningful reform , a senior Obama administration official said . 
Among other things , Washington was taking a close look at a speech delivered Sunday by Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's son -- which included warnings of a civil war if demonstrations in the North African country do n't stop . 
In the same speech , Saif Gadhafi also acknowledged changing times regionally and proposed `` radical '' reforms -- like bolstering local governments , relaxing restrictive laws , raising salaries , extending loans , and drafting a constitution , which does n't now exist . 
Obama officials continued to discuss with their Libyan counterparts the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters , the official added . 
President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation in Libya by his national security adviser , Tom Donilon , on Sunday night , the official also said . 
Despite the warning from Gadhafi 's son , Libya 's protesters are showing no sign of an intention to back down . 
After Gadhafi 's government apparently lost control of the city of Benghazi , some angry protesters in Tripoli said they hoped for a similar turn of events in the nation 's capital .

The Answer to that question I will leave up to you . 
But without the FRENCH , I strongly agree America would be alot less independent . 
The United States of America is letting down every Democratic Libyan by not being the ones on the phone every day convincing the UN councle to establish the NO FLY ZONE . 
Because when the Libyan Rebelian falls to Gadafi it will be the United States of America folks who will be the Bad GUY . 
Not Standing up for a Democratic Ally is the same as watching some one you know get the crap beat out of them and just watching it happen making you guilty by association . 
I just hope we have only missed the first play and not the Game by waiting this long . 
america should explore and drill their own oil . 
they should not buy oil from middleeast countries . 
nor invade or engage in war because of oil .

2011-02-21,"2 men charged in death of Chicago teen who performed in inauguration event . 
Continue they did , as the central government lost control of the coastal city of Banghazi , and protests continued in Tripoli . 
Though CNN has not yet been granted access to report on the ground , there were several reports of violence Monday . 
Protesters set a government building in Tripoli ablaze the day after ransacking the state TV headquarters , according to media accounts . 
In the capital , hundreds of pro-government protesters gathered to listen to a speaker in Green Square , an eyewitness said . 
Another group of protesters who tried to make their way to the square dispersed when confronted by security forces with tear gas . 
Crowds topped 50,000 people this weekend as demonstrators continue to express their frustration with the state 's budget bill . 
Gov. Scott Walker , however , is not retreating . 
The bill is vital and complaints that it is union-busting are a `` red herring , '' he said . 
Tom Morello , formerly Rage Against the Machine 's guitarist , has called Walker `` the Mubarak of the Midwest , '' likening the governor to the recently toppled Egyptian leader . 
Morello will perform solo for protesters Monday . 
The budget repair bill was proposed by Walker to address a $ 137 million shortfall through June 30 . 
It increases state workers ' contributions to their pensions and health insurance benefits , requires collective bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification and eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks . 
Fourteen Democratic state senators essentially boycotted the Legislature and went to Illinois to prevent a quorum from passing the bill . 
Walker has said powerful public employee unions are behind the blocking of the bill . 
It was one of the bloodiest 72 hours in recent memory , authorities said after 53 people , including four policeman , were killed in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico . 
It began Thursday when 14 people were killed . 
Twenty more were killed Friday - a state police investigator en route home , among them . 
Saturday brought 19 killings , including a patrolman killed by a driver whom he 'd just given a citation . 
He was shot 10 times in broad daylight . 
The violence was not exclusive to Ciudad Juarez , either . 
Mexico 's Public Security Secretariat reported that 13 taxi drivers were killed in Acapulco in a rash of violence that began Friday . 
Suspected drug traffickers are believed to be behind the violence in addition to setting cars ablaze and destroying street lights and security cameras . 
Among the casualties , a human head was discovered on a street and another body was found near a charred vehicle .

THE POEPLE NEED HELP ASAP There is no justification for Wisconsin taxpayers paying $ 57 for every $ 1 school teachers pay into their retirement account . 
That is absurd and the behavior of crazy people . 
To allow it to continue is insane . 
Retirement funds are subject to inflation , just like anyother fund . 
The concept of people living 30 to 40 years and paying into retirement is what Social Security Administration was founded on . 
Might as well stop paying interest on bank accounts and other investments .

Maybe a little Matamoros stew for the revelers ? 
I had too many lazy teachers in my school years to think any significant change has come forth .

2011-02-21,"February 21 , 2011 | By Tom Watkins , CNN During his 42 years in power , Gadhafi has limited the formation of political and other institutions . 
Whether Moammar Gadhafi stays or goes , the turmoil-wracked country is likely to be in for more of a rough time , two Libya experts told CNN Monday . 
`` Whichever way this goes , I think there 's going to be a good amount of chaos , '' said Diederik Vandewalle , associate professor of government at Dartmouth College . 
During his 42 years in power , Gadhafi has limited the formation of political and other institutions , Vandewalle said . 
`` All civil society organizations have been eviscerated by the regime , '' he said . 
In a telephone interview Monday night , he predicted more bloodshed if Gadhafi steps aside . 
`` We could see some tribal uprisings '' as competing groups seek a share of Libya 's oil wealth , he said , describing the likely scenario as `` not very pretty . '' 
But , he added , oil exports will likely continue after `` some '' interruption . 
`` It would be in the interest of all parties that oil keep flowing , '' he said , dismissing as unlikely any apocalyptic scenario in which Libya would descend into civil war . 
The current uncertainty will likely be decided in the next few days , he predicted . 
`` It seems to me that we 're in an endgame here , '' he said . 
`` The big question is how much bloodshed we 're going to see . '' 
He called the violence against unarmed civilians `` extraordinary , but not surprising from a regime that 's truly entrenched . '' 
There are few candidates in the wings to replace Gadhafi -- `` no younger leadership able to assume that mantle of leadership , '' he said . 
But Gadhafi 's imminent departure is not a foregone conclusion , he added , putting the odds at `` 80 % go , 20 % stay . '' 
Ronald Bruce St John , who has written seven books on Libya , said Gadhafi 's reign appears to be drawing quickly to a close . 
`` He 's losing support by the hour from critical people in his regime , '' he said . 
But St John said it was unlikely that the next leader would emerge from the military , since Gadhafi has long sought to keep the institution at arm 's length . 
`` Though he was an army officer when he came to power and was supported by the military and all the original members of the Revolutionary Command Council were from the military , he has , from the beginning , evidenced a great distrust for the military , '' St John said . 
`` He recognized it as the most likely power to overthrow him . '' 
As a result , Gadhafi has routinely rotated commanders `` so no one established a base of support . '' 
"
2011-02-21,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libya protests spread to Tripoli State Department has ordered the evacuation of all non-essential personnel The Obama administration is stressing the need to avoid violence against protesters Gadhafi 's son has warned of a possible civil war if protesters do not back down Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States on Monday condemned the violence in Libya and called for a halt to the `` unacceptable bloodshed '' in response to civil unrest , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement . 
`` The government of Libya has a responsibility to respect the universal rights of the people , including the right to free expression and assembly , '' Clinton 's statement said . 
`` Now is the time to stop this unacceptable bloodshed . 
We are working urgently with friends and partners around the world to convey this message to the Libyan government . '' 
It was the highest-level statement so far by the U.S. government on the accelerating strife in Libya , where reports Monday indicated a deteriorating situation with some military forces and pro-government allies attacking anti-government demonstrators . 
Two Republican senators called Monday for President Barack Obama to publicly denounce what they called `` egregious violations of human rights '' by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi . 
`` We urge the president to speak out clearly in support of the Libyan people , '' said a statement by Sen. Jon Kyl , R-Arizona , and Mark Kirk , R-Illinois . 
U.S. authorities were keeping a close watch on Libya 's rapidly unfolding political crisis , in part to see what possibilities might exist for meaningful reform , a senior Obama administration official said . 
Among other things , Washington was taking a close look at a speech early Monday by Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- the Libyan leader 's son -- which included warnings of a civil war if demonstrations in the North African country do n't stop . 
2010 : Connecting with Saif Gadhafi Obama officials continued to discuss with their Libyan counterparts the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters , the Obama administration official added . 
The State Department , meanwhile , ordered all U.S. Embassy family members and non-emergency personnel to depart Libya . 
U.S. citizens were urged to defer all travel to the country . 
Despite the warning from Gadhafi 's son , Libya 's protesters showed no sign of backing down . 
After Gadhafi 's government apparently lost control of the city of Benghazi , angry protesters said they hoped for a similar turn of events in the capital , Tripoli . 
Tripoli residents said state-run al-Shababiya TV was attacked Sunday evening by anti-government protesters . 
CNN , however , could not immediately confirm reports . 
The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country . 
CNN has interviewed witnesses by phone . 
The unrest , spurred largely by high unemployment and demands for freedom , has left at least 233 people dead in Libya , according to Human Rights Watch , citing hospital sources . 
The growing U.S. pressure on Gadhafi -- a famously mercurial leader -- is only the latest in a series of twists and turns in the relationship between Washington and Tripoli over his 42 years of rule . 
In 1986 , Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that resulted in the death an American service member . 
President Ronald Reagan ordered the bombing targets in Libya in response and imposed economic sanctions . 
Reagan dubbed Gadhafi the `` mad dog of the Middle East . '' 
Two years later , Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland . 
In 1999 , Gadhafi tried to thaw his icy relationship with the West , agreeing to demands to turn over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing . 
In 2003 , he agreed to eliminate his pursuit and stockpile of weapons of mass destruction . 
The moves helped Libya regain diplomatic relations with the United States in 2006 . 
In 2008 , however , Swiss officials jailed one of Gadhafi 's sons , prompting the furious leader to cut off the country 's oil supplies , withdraw Libyan money from Swiss banks and threaten to sever diplomatic ties . 
Two years ago , Gadhafi returned to the international spotlight yet again when Scotland agreed to release convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi , who received a hero 's welcome in Libya . 
Scottish authorities said al-Megrahi was terminally ill with cancer and , as a result , was released on compassionate grounds . 
Skeptics , including several U.S. senators , contend that al-Megrahi was released as part of a deal fueled by British business interests in Libya , including oil giant BP . 
Libya is one of Europe 's key oil suppliers .

2011-02-21,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : Witnesses report gunfire , masked men blasting pro-Gadhafi music in Tripoli NEW : Death toll nationwide now up to at least 219 , medical sources say Moammar Gadhafi 's son says foreign media have overstated the violence in Libya Witnesses report that protesters aided by military have taken over Benghazi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi early Monday proposed the speedy implementation of significant democratic reforms in the traditionally restrictive country , while warning of a chaotic civil war , return to colonialism and mass poverty if citizens sided with anti-government demonstrators . 
`` Tomorrow , we can speak rationally , we can spare the blood , we can stand all together for the sake of Libya , '' Saif al-Islam Gadhafi said during a speech on Libyan state television that he said was unscripted . 
But if the unrest continues , `` forget about democracy , forget about reform ... It will be a fierce civil war . '' 
While criticizing international media for overstating its extent , the younger Gadhafi acknowledged the violence in Libya as well as `` mistakes '' by police and military in addressing unrest . 
Still , he principally blamed drunks , criminals and foreigners for fanning dissent and instigating attacks that threatened to tear apart Libya . 
Witness : It can only be called genocide Obtaining independent confirmation on events in Libya is very difficult . 
The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country . 
CNN has interviewed , however , numerous witnesses by phone . 
Saif Gadhafi , appointed in 2009 as Libya 's general coordinator , insisted his father , Moammar , was not like recently deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . 
He also said Libya was unlike those two countries , predicting that its civil war would be `` 1,000 times worse '' and its economic hardship even more severe should the current government fall . 
He conceded these are `` difficult times '' and that `` there are people inside Libya who are opposing us . '' 
Even while he cast blame , the leader 's son also acknowledged changing times regionally and proposed `` radical '' reforms -- like bolstering local governments , relaxing restrictive laws , raising salaries , extending loans and drafting a constitution , which does n't now exist . 
Michele Dunne , an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace , noted that the Western-educated Saif Gadhafi has pushed such reforms previously , but they have not gotten much traction . 
Meanwhile , eyewitnesses -- who are not being identified , for security reasons -- told CNN about significant movement and growing violence on Sunday , the sixth consecutive day of unrest in the isolated and reclusive North African nation . 
Medical sources and others on the ground have said that at least 219 had died nationwide in the violence . 
Saif Gadhafi , though , claimed in his speech that international media had overstated the death toll . 
He also claimed foreign nations and `` illegal immigrants '' had stirred the uprising , with some dissenters attacking government installations as well as stealing caches of weapons . 
The central government lost control of Benghazi , with multiple witnesses reporting that protesters took over Libya 's second-largest city with support from some military who dropped their allegiance to Moammar Gadhafi . 
Protester : ` We want our basic rights ' However , his son continued to insist the military remained loyal to the ruling government and would be taking an increasingly active role in suppressing unrest in the coming days . 
The reported power shift followed fresh clashes that left 25 dead earlier in the day , a doctor at Benghazi 's Al Jalla Hospital said . 
A source at Benghazi Medical Center , the city 's other major hospital , said there were 10 people dead there Sunday . 
One man told CNN that uniformed troops opened fire on thousands of mourners as they passed through the streets during a funeral procession honoring those killed the previous day . 
Protesters later Sunday packed at least one car with explosives and sent it crashing into a compound wall at a military camp in the eastern city , eyewitnesses said . 
Security forces then fired on the protesters as they attempted to breach the camp . 
On the camp 's southern side , meanwhile , protesters drove a tank from a nearby army base in another attempt to break in , witnesses said . 
They have also obtained other weapons , the protester said . 
Libyan state television reported the camp has been defended , and that protesters were being warned on loudspeakers not to attack the compound . 
The network called it an act of sabotage . 
The protester said that the military camp is significant because it houses Gadhafi 's eastern palace . 
`` It 's a symbol of his dominance here , '' he said . 
`` And it 's the last symbol , basically . '' 
A protester said some fellow anti-government demonstrators had other weapons . 
Saif Gadhafi alluded to this claim in his speech early Monday , claiming criminal elements had stolen weaponry and even fired them in an attempt to cast blame on military and security forces . 
People said there was a food shortage in parts of Benghazi . 
The internet remained down in the city and electricity was cut off for the second night in the row , but was back in the morning . 
One man , a technology expert who has set up cameras airing live online video streams around Benghazi , estimated that the numbers of anti-government demonstrators in the city has grown by 20 % since the protests began Tuesday . 
`` There are a lot of people getting killed for their freedom , '' he said Sunday . 
`` Our goal is simple : We want Gadhafi to leave . 
... We want democracy . '' 
Others in Libya reported similar protests in the cities of al-Baida , Ajdabiya and significantly in Misratah -- an indication that the demonstrations centered in the east may be spreading west . 
Meanwhile , the most significant unrest to date hit Moammar Gadhafi 's doorstep of Tripoli on Sunday . 
Clashes broke out between a large crowd of demonstrators and people who appeared to be African mercenaries in the center of the city , according to an activist . 
Elsewhere , hundreds of protesters were demonstrating in front of the courthouse , the activist said . 
Both groups were calling for the downfall of the regime . 
A woman said she saw demonstrators running down a Tripoli street outside her window , chased by apparent mercenaries in pickup trucks . 
The Africans were firing at the demonstrators and throwing tear gas at them , according to the witness . 
Many families have closed their windows and turned off their lights out of fear , she said . 
Another witness said that crowds of anti-government demonstrators hit the streets and set cars on fire . 
Masked , armed men in SUVs drove through the streets blasting pro-government music , said the witness , claiming that the same people had been firing at protesters and passerby . 
Gunfire also rang out near Green Square and the presidential palace , according to multiple witnesses . 
Another man said that men were walking around Libya 's streets with automatic rifles early Monday , firing seemingly indiscriminately . 
The crackdown , as well as the government 's role and reaction to it , stoked the ire of many opposed to Moammar Gadhafi as well as governments outside Libya . 
Libya 's ambassador to the Arab League said Sunday he resigned his position on Saturday over `` the killing of innocent people . '' 
Abdel Elhuni said the protesters are asking for `` normal things '' and that Gadhafi is `` over , finished . '' 
He speculated that the Libyan leader has only a day or two left in power because `` he lost the people . '' 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke on Sunday with Saif Gadhafi and `` made clear the U.K. 's grave concern at the escalation of violence , '' the Foreign Office said in a statement . 
`` He expressed alarm at reports of large numbers of people being killed or attacked by Libyan security forces . 
The Foreign Secretary told Mr. Gadhafi that the Libyan government 's actions were unacceptable and would result in worldwide condemnation . '' 
The United States also said it was `` gravely concerned with disturbing reports and images coming out of Libya . 
`` We are working to ascertain the facts , but we have received multiple credible reports that hundreds of people have been killed and injured in several days of unrest -- and the full extent of the death toll is unknown due to the lack of access of international media and human rights organizations , '' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said in a statement . 
U.S. officials have communicated to Libyan officials including Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa `` our strong objections to the use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrators , '' Crowley said . 
`` Libyan officials have stated their commitment to protecting and safeguarding the right of peaceful protest . 
We call upon the Libyan government to uphold that commitment and hold accountable any security officer who does not act in accordance with that commitment . '' 
One man in Tripoli said was particularly angry at state-run TV for `` pretending that nothing is happening . '' 
A medical staff member at Benghazi Medical Center was among those sharply critical of Saif Gadhafi 's speech , calling him a liar and saying -- disputing his assertion that Libya could split into several parts if not united under his father 's rule -- the nation was one . 
`` There are no divisions among Libyans , '' the staff member said . 
`` We want to be united with our brothers and sisters ... All Libyans think this way , it is the regime that lacks knowledge about the people . ''

`` Gadhafi reacted so ruthlessly that he might end up being forced out -LRB- of his country -RRB- . 
I do n't want to make predictions or anything , but he 's shooting at people ; he is using the military and weapons against defenseless people , '' Gorbachev said . 
In a wide-ranging news conference to announce nominees for his new Gorbachev Awards for `` world changers , '' Gorbachev weighed in on protests rattling the Middle East and criticized the Libyan regime for brutally repressing its own people . 
`` People are trying to get of out poverty , and they 've got nothing to lose . 
I think it 's now very important that Europe and the United States respond to this situation very responsibly , '' he said . 
Gadhafi reacted so ruthlessly that he might end up being forced out . 
-- Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev The former Soviet leader had blunt criticism for leaders in his own country as well . 
Gorbachev blamed both President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin for the state of Russian democracy , calling its institutions `` fake . '' 
He added that both are showing incredible arrogance and disrespect for voters when suggesting that they would discuss between the two of them who should run for president in 2012 . 
Gorbachev has been ever more outspoken in recent weeks in criticizing Russian leaders , saying he sees the country becoming increasingly entrenched in a dangerous , authoritarian system . 
In an interview with a Russian newspaper he co-owns , Gorbachev said he was trying to start a new political party but has been blocked by the Kremlin . 
He claims Kremlin bosses refuse to officially register and recognize his new social democratic party . 
Gorbachev says Russia is in need of a democratic revival . 
Many Russians are ambivalent toward Gorbachev and his legacy . 
While many concede he brought real change to their lives with greater freedoms under Perestroika and with the dissolution of the Soviet Union , many also blame him for hardships that came afterward .

2011-02-21,"The White House is `` analyzing '' the speech of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi to see `` what possibilities it contains for meaningful reform , '' a senior U.S. administration official said Sunday night after the Libyan leader 's son took to the airwaves to propose speedy implementation of significant democratic reforms following days of anti-government demonstrations . 
The same source confirmed that President Barack Obama was monitoring the situation in Libya and `` considering all appropriate actions . '' 
The increased violence seen this weekend has prompted the White house to seek `` clarification '' from senior Libyan officials , the source added . 
`` We continue to raise with -LRB- Libyan officials -RRB- the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters and respect universal rights . '' 
The terminology echoed an earlier statement from State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley . 
In a speech on Libyan state television that he said was unscripted , Gadhafi warned of a civil war and mass poverty if citizens sided with anti-government demonstrators . 
`` Tomorrow , we can speak rationally , we can spare the blood , we can stand all together for the sake of Libya , '' he said . 
But if the unrest continues , `` forget about democracy , forget about reform ... It will be a fierce civil war . '' 
Events in Libya are very difficult to confirm , since the government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated CNN requests for access to the country . 
Inside Libya , a local leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in the coastal city , Misurata , was unimpressed by Gadhafi 's speech . 
`` He is worse than his father , '' the leader said . 
`` His claims about the establishment of Islamic emirates in the country is not true at all . 
`` Despite our differences , Libyans are all one , '' he continued . 
`` They are all out on the streets against the regime . 
He called the protesters unstable ! 
It is the regime members who are not stable for spending the country 's wealth on petty things ! '' 
The country 's second-largest city , Benghazi , has seen some of the bloodiest clashes since protests began . 
A staff member working at the Benghazi Medical Center said of Gadhafi : `` He is a liar . 
Contrary to what Saif said , there are no divisions among Libyans . 
We are proud to be free from this regime . 
We have liberated the east of the country and we want to be united with our brothers and sisters in the east . 
... All Libyans think this way , it is the regime that lacks knowledge about the people . '' 
Meanwhile , a journalist working in the capital Tripoli said the speech caused further confusion . 
`` But most do not believe his talk of civil war , '' the journalist said . 
`` Earlier , thousands went to the streets chanting anti-government slogans calling on Gadhafi to leave the country . 
But now after the speech some pro-government crowds gathered in the downtown area . '' 
Human Rights Watch researcher Fred Abrahams said that he did n't believe the speech would placate crowds of people who are looking for change . 
`` There 's been so much resentment built up over four decades of rule , '' he said . 
`` Serious violations , disappearances , political killings , total restrictions on freedom of assembly , no free media , and corruption ... And those resentments bubble up from Libyans . ''

Anti-government protesters rallied in Tripoli 's streets , tribal leaders spoke out against Gaddafi , and army units defected to the opposition as in a revolt that has cost the lives of more than 200 people . 
A major government building in the capital was on fire on Monday morning , a Reuters reporter said . 
The building is where the General People 's Congress , or parliament , meets when it is in session in Tripoli . 
The eastern city of Benghazi , where the protests began last week after the arrest of a human rights lawyer and where scores of people have been killed by security forces , was said by some residents to be effectively in the hands of the protesters . 
Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi appeared on national television in an attempt both to threaten and calm people , saying the army would enforce security at any price to put down one of the bloodiest revolts to convulse the Arab world . 
`` Our spirits are high and the leader Muammar Gaddafi is leading the battle in Tripoli , and we are behind him as is the Libyan army , '' he said . 
`` We will keep fighting until the last man standing , even to the last woman standing ... We will not leave Libya to the Italians or the Turks . '' 
Wagging a finger at the camera , he blamed Libyan exiles for fomenting the violence . 
But he also promised dialogue on reforms and wage rises . 
A Tripoli resident , who did not want to be identified , told Reuters the streets of the capital were calm early on Monday morning . 
There was no sign of police , which is unusual for the city . 
He said that late on Sunday night anti-Gaddafi protesters had been replaced by his supporters , who rallied in the center of the city around Green Square until about 5 a.m. -LRB- 0400 GMT -RRB- . 
`` After Saif al-Islam 's speech , the pro-Gaddafi people , especially the youth , were touring the streets , particularly in the center , cheering Gaddafi . 
These people stayed up the whole night , they were marching all night , some driving in cars . 
`` They were in Green Square and along Omar al-Mokthar street . 
I would say there were hundreds , '' he said . 
`` I talked to someone near the square where the clashes were taking place and he told me it was quiet and they -LRB- anti-government demonstrators -RRB- have now departed . 
`` Last night during the rioting there were police around and they were shooting into the air . 
But after that there have been no police around , '' added the Tripoli resident . 
Saif al-Islam 's cajoling may not be enough to douse the anger unleashed after four decades of rule by Gaddafi -- mirroring events in Egypt where a popular revolt overthrew the seemingly impregnable President Hosni Mubarak 10 days ago . 
`` People here in Benghazi are laughing at what he is saying . 
It is the same old story -LRB- on promised reform -RRB- and nobody believes what he says , '' a lawyer in Libya 's second city told the BBC after watching the speech . 
`` He is liar , liar , 42 years we have heard these lies . '' 
In Benghazi , protesters appeared to be largely in control after forcing troops and police to retreat to a compound . 
Government buildings were set ablaze and ransacked . 
`` Security now , it is by the people , '' the lawyer said . 
`` Youths with weapons are in charge of the city . 
There are no security forces anywhere , '' University of Benghazi professor Hanaa Elgallal told Al Jazeera International television . 
Salahuddin Abdullah , a self-described protest organiser , said : `` In Benghazi there is celebration and euphoria . 
People are ecstatic about the situation . 
Right now it is calm . 
The city is no longer under military control . 
It is completely under demonstrators control . '' 
He told the TV network that protesters were trying to establish order by creating self-rule committees to run the city and distribute basic foodstuffs . 
European Union foreign ministers will condemn the repression of anti-government protests in Libya at their meeting later on Monday , according to the draft of a joint statement . 
France said the international community must do everything it can do prevent Libya sinking into civil war . 
The United States said it was weighing `` all appropriate actions '' in response to the unrest . 
`` We are analyzing the speech ... to see what possibilities it contains for meaningful reform , '' a U.S. official said . 
Libya 's ambassador to India told the BBC he was resigning in protest at the violent crackdown that has killed more than 200 . 
Ali al-Essawi also accused the government of deploying foreign mercenaries against the protesters . 
The Turkish Foreign Ministry said that around 3,000 Turkish citizens had applied to be repatriated from Libya since Friday and the first plane was sent to Benghazi on Sunday morning , with more planes to be sent once permission was granted . 
But CNN Turk reported that one Turkish Airlines plane had returned without landing amid reports that the airport had been taken over by opposition protesters . 
It was unclear if this plane was the same as the one mentioned by the foreign ministry . 
In the first sign of serious unrest in the capital , thousands of protesters clashed with Gaddafi supporters . 
Gunfire rang out in the night and police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators , some of whom threw stones at Gaddafi billboards . 
South Korea said hundreds of Libyans , some armed with knives and guns , attacked a South Korean-run construction site in Tripoli , injuring at least 4 foreign workers . 
Human Rights Watch said at least 223 people have been killed in five days of violence . 
Most were in Benghazi , cradle of the uprising and a region where Gaddafi 's grip has always been weaker than elsewhere in the oil-rich desert nation . 
Habib al-Obaidi , a surgeon at the Al-Jalae hospital , said the bodies of 50 people , most of them shot , were brought there on Sunday afternoon . 
Two hundred wounded had arrived , he said . 
Members of an army unit known as the `` Thunderbolt '' squad had brought wounded comrades to the hospital , he said . 
The soldiers said they had defected to the cause of the protesters and had fought and defeated Gaddafi 's elite guards . 
The Libyan uprising is one of series of revolts that have raced like wildfire across the Arab world since December , toppling the long-time rulers of Tunisia and Egypt and threatening entrenched dynasties from Bahrain to Yemen . 
The West has watched with alarm as long-time allies and old foes have come under threat , appealing for reform and urging restraint . 
Support for Gaddafi , the son of a herdsman who seized power in 1969 , among Libya 's desert tribes was also waning . 
The leader of the Al-Zuwayya tribe in the east threatened to cut oil exports unless authorities halted `` oppression of protesters '' . 
Libya is Africa 's fourth biggest oil exporter , producing 1.6 million barrels of oil a day . 
Oil jumped by more than $ 1 a barrel to $ 103.5 a barrel on fears the unrest could disrupt supplies . 
Some foreign oil companies were withdrawing small numbers of expatriate staff .

2011-02-21,"TRIPOLI | Mon Feb 21 , 2011 11:52 pm GMT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi fought an increasingly bloody battle to hang on to power on Monday when protests against his 41-year rule struck the capital Tripoli after days of violence in the east . 
Residents reported gunfire in parts of Tripoli and one political activist said warplanes had bombed the city . 
But state TV showed government supporters rallying and Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said warplanes had hit only ammunition dumps . 
Forces loyal to Gaddafi had killed dozens of people across the country , human rights groups and witnesses said , prompting widespread condemnation from world leaders . 
No independent verification of the reports was available and communications with Libya from outside were difficult . 
But a picture emerged of a leader who has loomed large on the world stage for decades and controls vast reserves of oil fighting for survival . 
Brent crude prices hit $ 108 a barrel on fears the violence could disrupt supplies from Libya . 
`` What we are witnessing today is unimaginable . 
Warplanes and helicopters are indiscriminately bombing one area after another . 
There are many , many dead , '' Adel Mohamed Saleh said in a live broadcast on al Jazeera television . 
`` Anyone who moves , even if they are in their car , they will hit you . '' 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it was `` time to stop this unacceptable bloodshed '' in Libya . 
A group of army officers issued a statement urging fellow soldiers to `` join the people '' and help remove Gaddafi . 
The justice minister resigned in protest at the `` excessive use of violence '' against protesters and diplomats at Libya 's mission to the United Nations called on the Libyan army to help overthrow `` the tyrant Muammar Gaddafi . '' 
Both Libya and Venezuela denied reports that Gaddafi had fled to the South American country ruled by his friend and fellow revolutionary President Hugo Chavez . 
Libyan state television said Gaddafi would give a speech shortly . 
Two Libyan fighter jets landed in Malta , their pilots defecting after they said they had been ordered to bomb protesters , Maltese government officials said . 
An analyst for London-based consultancy Control Risks said the reported air strikes indicated the end was near for Gaddafi . 
`` These really seem to be last , desperate acts . 
If you 're bombing your own capital , it 's really hard to see how you can survive , '' its Middle East analyst Julien Barnes-Dacey said . 
The demonstrations spread to Tripoli , on the Mediterranean Sea , after several cities in the east , including Benghazi , appeared to fall to the opposition , according to residents . 
Human Rights Watch said at least 233 people had been killed in five days of violence , but opposition groups put the figure much higher . 
A coalition of Libyan Muslim leaders told all Muslims it was their duty to rebel against the Libyan leadership because of its `` bloody crimes against humanity . '' 
The building where the General People 's Congress , or parliament , meets in Tripoli was on fire on Monday , as was a police station in an eastern suburb , witnesses said . 
Al Jazeera television quoted medical sources as saying 61 people had been killed in the latest protests in Tripoli . 
It said security forces were looting banks and other government institutions in Tripoli , and protesters had broken into several police stations and ransacked them . 
Saif al-Islam said on Sunday his father would fight the revolt until `` the last man standing . '' 
Some analysts suggested Libya was heading for civil war . 
`` I think what 's going to happen is going to be much more chaotic than what we saw in Egypt or Tunisia . 
Gaddafi and his sons do n't have anywhere else to go ... They are going to fight , '' said North Africa analyst Geoff Porter , contributor to political risk consultancy Wikistrat . 
Output at one of Libya 's oil fields was reported to have been stopped by a workers ' strike and some European oil companies withdrew expatriate workers and suspended operations . 
Most of Libya 's oil fields are in the east , south of Benghazi . 
Anti-government protests have also broken out in the central town of Ras Lanuf , the site of an oil refinery and petrochemical complex , Libya 's Quryna newspaper said on its website on Monday . 
Libyan guards have withdrawn from their side of the border with Egypt and people 's committees were now in control of the crossing , the Egyptian army said , without making if clear if the groups now in control of the border were loyal to Gaddafi . 
Gaddafi supporters were in central Tripoli 's Green Square on Monday , waving flags and carrying his portrait , Libyan state TV said .

2011-02-21,"-LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Following are quotes on the unfolding situation in Libya : SHADI HAMID , DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT THE BROOKINGS DOHA `` Where is the compromise solution ? 
It was not available in Egypt or Tunisia and it is likely to be the same in Libya . 
`` Libya is the most likely candidate for civil war because the government has lost control over part of its own territory . 
`` Benghazi was lost to the opposition and there are reports of other smaller cities going the same way . 
It is not something the Gaddafi regime is willing to tolerate . '' 
ALASTAIR NEWTON , POLITICAL ANALYST , NOMURA `` We believe that the 11 February ousting of President Mubarak of Egypt is proving to be a pivotal moment in turning turmoil into a tsunami ... The past week has seen unrest spread geographically -- notably to Libya -LRB- where regime collapse may be imminent -RRB- , Bahrain and Iran -- to the point where there does now appear to be a potential threat to oil and gas output . 
`` Further contagion can not be ruled out ; but we think this will likely be limited to the MENA region for the time being . '' 
ITALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER FRANCO FRATTINI `` Libya now is a matter of serious concern because I think Libya urgently needs to start a process of national reconciliation , peaceful reconciliation , stopping violence , while defending the territorial integrity of Libya . 
I am extremely concerned about the self-proclamation of the so-called Islamic Emirate of Benghazi . 
Would you imagine to have an Islamic emirate on the borders of Europe ? 
This would be a really serious threat . 
`` I am very concerned about the idea of dividing Libya in two ... that would be very dangerous . 
We Europeans are very concerned about the migratory flow impact that would be one of the consequences of turbulence in North Africa . 
`` The process of national reconciliation should begin peacefully and lead to the point of a Libyan constitution , that should be a fundamental objective . '' 
FINNISH FOREIGN MINISTER ALEXANDER STUBB `` We 're in a situation in Libya where we can only condemn the violence . 
At the same time it 's not our job to change the leader of Libya , it is the job of the leadership of Libya to listen to its people . 
And to be quite honest , listening to people does n't mean you should be using a machine gun . '' 
GERMANY DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER WERNER HOYER On Libyan threat to withdraw cooperation on migrants `` This was unbelievably offtrack , the European Union should not let itself be blackmailed . '' 
LUXEMBOURG FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN ASSELBORN On Libya and migrant threat `` We ca n't return to medieval methods , especially after what has happened in Egypt and Tunisia . 
They -LRB- Libya -RRB- used snipers to shoot at people who are uttering their free opinion and want more democracy . 
`` We ca n't ignore the elementary humanitarian issues and be blackmailed by such a regime . 
It ca n't be that we have to stick with a regime that bumps off its own people . '' 
SWEDISH FOREIGN MINISTER CARL BILDT `` If you look at the demographic development , during the next decades , Egypt will be bigger than Russia and there will be two additional Egypts added from the populations of the south of the Mediterranean . 
`` So the challenges in terms of reforms over the next years and decades are ominous . '' 
`` We are extremely concerned with events . 
We have condemned very clearly the repression that is ongoing . 
But then we are looking beyond what is happening today . 
It is a longer-term challenge of development and reform , of economic growth in that entire part of North Africa and the Middle East . '' 
`` A breakdown scenario in Libya is not at all unthinkable and would have grave consequences in a number of areas . 
In the Mediterranean countries , there are a lot of worries about what this could entail . 
A considerable flow of refugees is clearly a very obvious possibility , and would demand European solidarity . '' 
`` But none of this of course affects our view of the serious violations and the considerable use of violence we are now seeing . ''

2011-02-21,"TRIPOLI\/MANAMA | Mon Feb 21 , 2011 7:47 pm GMT TRIPOLI\/MANAMA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Violent unrest against Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi spread to the capital Tripoli on Sunday and his son vowed to fight until the `` last man standing '' after scores of protesters were killed in the east of the country . 
Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam said in an address on state TV the army stood behind his father as a `` leader of the battle in Tripoli '' and would enforce security at any price . 
His comments were the first official reaction from the Libyan authorities since the unrest began . 
As he spoke , police used tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters in Tripoli , where gunfire was heard , vehicles were on fire and protesters threw stones at billboards of Gaddafi , who is facing the most serious challenge to his four-decade rule . 
Revolutions which deposed the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt have shaken the Arab world and inspired protests across the Middle East and North Africa , threatening the grip of long-entrenched autocratic leaders . 
In the Gulf kingdom of Bahrain , thousands of protesters gathered in a square in Manama , calling for political change and awaiting promised talks with the island 's Sunni rulers . 
After days of violence , the mood among the mainly Shi'ite protesters appeared to be more conciliatory . 
Libya , however was witnessing the bloodiest episodes yet in two months of unrest convulsing the Arab world . 
A resident in Tripoli told Reuters by telephone he could hear gunshots . 
`` We 're inside the house and the lights are out . 
There are gunshots in the street , '' he said . 
`` That 's what I hear , gunshots and people . 
I ca n't go outside . '' 
An expatriate worker said : `` Some anti-government demonstrators are gathering in the residential complexes . 
The police are dispersing them . 
I can also see burning cars . '' 
Al Jazeera television said thousands of protesters clashed with supporters of Gaddafi in Tripoli 's Green Square . 
The violence spread to Tripoli after days of protests in Benghazi , Libya 's second largest city , in which at least 233 people have been killed , according to Human Rights Watch . 
Communications are tightly controlled and Benghazi is not accessible to international journalists , but the picture that has emerged is of a city slipping from the grasp of security forces in the biggest challenge to Gaddafi 's rule since the `` brotherly leader '' seized power in a 1969 military coup . 
Habib al-Obaidi , head of the intensive care unit at the main Al-Jalae hospital in Benghazi , said the bodies of 50 people , mostly killed by gunshots , had been brought there on Sunday afternoon . 
The deaths came after scores were killed on Saturday . 
Two hundred people had arrived wounded , 100 of them in serious condition , he said . 
Members of an army unit known as the `` Thunderbolt '' squad had come to the hospital carrying wounded comrades , he said . 
The soldiers said they had defected to the cause of the hundreds of thousands of protesters in the streets and had fought and defeated Gaddafi 's elite guards . 
`` They are now saying that they have overpowered the Praetorian Guard and that they have joined the people 's revolt , '' another man at the hospital who heard the soldiers , lawyer Mohamed al-Mana , told Reuters by telephone . 
A Libyan tribal leader threatened to block oil exports to the West within 24 hours if the government does not stop the `` oppression of protesters . '' 
Another tribal chief told al Jazeera Gaddafi had to leave the country . 
Saif al-Islam , who has in the past pushed a reform agenda in Libya with only limited success , said the protests threatened to sink Libya into civil war and split the country . 
He said reports of hundreds killed were an exaggeration , but acknowledged the police and army made mistakes in dealing with the protests . 
The General People 's Congress , Libya 's equivalent of a parliament , would convene on Monday to discuss a `` clear '' reform agenda , while the government would also raise wages , in an apparent attempt to address some of the protesters ' demands , he said . 
The clamor for reform across a region of huge strategic importance to the West and the source of much of its oil began in Tunisia in December . 
The overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali then inspired Egyptians to rise up against strongman Hosni Mubarak , overthrowing him on February 11 . 
The tide has challenged Arab leaders , including many who have long been backed by the West as vital energy suppliers and enemies of Islamist militants . 
While each uprising has its own dynamics , from religion to tribalism , all protesters seem united by frustration over economic hardship and a lack of political freedom under entrenched elites . 
Unrest also hit Yemen , Tunisia , Morocco , Oman , Kuwait , Algeria and Djibouti over the weekend as people took to the streets demanding political and economic change . 
In Iran , thousands of security personnel deployed in the streets of Tehran and other cities to prevent protesters rallying in spite of a ban , opposition websites said . 
The United States said it was `` gravely concerned '' by the situation in Libya and warned its citizens to delay trips there . 
In Bahrain , the main opposition party said it wanted the crown prince to show signs of addressing opposition demands before any formal dialogue could start . 
Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa , of the ruling Sunni Muslim dynasty , made conciliatory moves after days of violence in which at least six people died . 
`` All political parties in the country deserve a voice at the table , '' he told CNN . 
`` I think there is a lot of anger , a lot of sadness ... We are terribly sorry and this is a terrible tragedy for our nation , '' said the prince , who is seen as a reformist . 
Ibrahim Mattar , a lawmaker of the main opposition Wefaq party , said protesters , thousands of whom were camping out in Pearl square , wanted more than words . 
`` We are waiting for an initiative from him , with a scope for dialogue , '' he said , adding that the prince should `` send a small signal he is willing to have a constitutional monarchy . '' 
Shi'ites , who make up 70 percent of the population , complain of unfair treatment in Bahrain , an ally of the United States , whose Fifth Fleet is based there . 
The opposition is demanding a constitutional monarchy that gives citizens a greater role in a directly elected government . 
It also wants the release of political prisoners . 
Speculation was growing that Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa , in office since independence from Britain in 1971 , would be replaced by the crown prince . 
In Tunisia on Sunday , security forces fired into the air as tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered downtown to call for the replacement of the interim government -- a sign that problems are not all swept away with the removal of a dictator . 
In Yemen , shots were fired at a demonstration in the capital Sanaa on the ninth consecutive day of unrest . 
Thousands were demanding the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh , who called for dialogue with the opposition . 
But the coalition of main opposition parties said there could be no dialogue with `` bullets and sticks and thuggery , '' or with a government `` which gathers mercenaries to occupy public squares ... and terrorise people . '' 
At least 2,000 protesters gathered in a square in Morocco 's capital on Sunday to demand King Mohammed give up some powers .

2011-02-21,"ROME Feb 21 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Monday condemned violence by Libyan forces against civilians as `` unacceptable '' and said he was `` alarmed '' over the situation in the North African state . 
The statement by Berlusconi , who has cultivated close ties with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , comes after he was criticised widely for not speaking up earlier on Libya and saying that he did not want to `` disturb '' Gaddafi during the crisis . 
Berlusconi also called on the European Union and the international community to do everything to prevent the situation in Libya from degenerating into a civil war .

2011-02-21,"Analysis : Libya may face civil war as Gaddafi 's grip loosens DUBAI | Mon Feb 21 , 2011 12:47 pm EST DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya faces chaos and possible civil war as Muammar Gaddafi fights to maintain his 42-year grip on power in the face of a popular uprising . 
Even if he flees -- assuming he could find a refuge -- Gaddafi would leave a nation with few normal structures for a peaceful transition , after four decades of his idiosyncratic rule . 
`` Any post-Gaddafi period is fraught with uncertainty , '' said Middle East analyst Philip McCrum . 
`` There is no organized opposition , there are no civil institutions around which people could ordinarily gather . 
`` The opposition in exile is small and disparate . 
It will therefore take a long time for a new political order to establish itself and in the meantime , political tensions will run high as various competing groups , such as the tribes , the army , Islamists and liberals vie for power . '' 
Dozens of people were reported killed in Libya overnight as anti-government protests reached the capital , Tripoli , for the first time . 
Several eastern cities appeared to be in opposition hands . 
The revolt has already cost more than 200 lives . 
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi , one of the mercurial leader 's sons , appeared on state TV overnight , mixing threats with appeals for calm , saying the army would enforce security at any price . 
`` We will keep fighting until the last man standing , even the last woman standing , '' he said , waving a finger at the camera . 
McCrum said Saif al-Islam 's speech had probably scotched any hopes among young Libyans that he could be a force for reform . 
The uprising in Libya already looks set to be the bloodiest in a series of popular protests racing across the Middle East from Algeria to Yemen . 
Possibilities for compromise look slim . 
`` Libya is the most likely candidate for civil war because the government has lost control over part of its own territory , '' said Shadi Hamid , of the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar . 
`` Benghazi was lost to the opposition and there are reports of other smaller cities going the same way . 
It is not something the Gaddafi regime is willing to tolerate . '' 
Benghazi , a city in eastern Libya -- the region that is home to most of the country 's oilfields -- is a traditional hotbed of anti-Gaddafi sentiment among tribes hostile to his rule . 
As the protests have snowballed , Islamic leaders and once-loyal tribes have declared for the opposition . 
Saad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer who for years defended Libya in the Lockerbie airline bombing case , said Gaddafi must go . 
`` I 'm sure he has armed to the teeth his own tribesmen and those tribes linked to him . 
I 'm sure he will be also giving them as much cash as possible , '' Djebbar told Reuters . 
He said Gaddafi had narrowed the circle of his power to his close family and tribe in recent years , alienating allies and tribes who had backed him after he seized power in 1969 . 
`` Gaddafi will go down fighting and Libyans will butcher each other . 
It 's a fight to the bitter end . 
If he activates the tribal card , it will only turn Libya into another Somalia . '' 
Djebbar said Western powers should consider protecting any rebel-held areas such as eastern Libya by using air power to bar Gaddafi from bombing his foes into submission -- similar to the no-fly zone they set up in Iraqi Kurdistan after the 1991 Gulf War to deter Saddam Hussein from reasserting control there . 
`` Gaddafi is like a cornered animal -- when threatened he attacks ferociously , '' said McCrum . 
`` Throughout his rule , he has shown no qualms in brutally suppressing any opposition . 
`` He is highly unlikely to make any concessions and if he goes down , he will take as many people with him as possible , '' he added , predicting that events in Libya `` will only get bloodier . '' 
McCrum said he doubted the army would turn on Gaddafi or emulate the role played by the military in facilitating the departure of long-serving autocrats in Egypt and Tunisia . 
`` The army will not actually effect regime change as in Egypt . 
They will simply perpetuate the status quo to protect their own interests , '' he said , noting that main arms of the security services were controlled by sons of Gaddafi . 
Libya , once a pariah accused of sponsoring international terrorism , rehabilitated itself by paying compensation to victims of the Lockerbie bombing and other attacks , and by renouncing its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction . 
`` If ever there was a regime which exposes the West 's hypocrisy , Gaddafi 's is it , '' McCrum said . 
`` The West has fallen over itself to rehabilitate Gaddafi so they can get at his oil and now it will pay the price in political capital -- if it has any left . 
In terms of investment risk , it 's obviously very serious , '' said Julien Barnes-Dace , Middle East analyst at Control Risks . 
`` People are just pulling out . 
Even if Gaddafi survives , there will be huge worries and reputational issues about doing business in Libya . 
Libya would be much more isolated after this . '' 
Analyst Geoff Porter said Gaddafi had `` nowhere to go , '' unlike ousted Arab leaders such as Tunisia 's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali , who found refuge in Saudi Arabia , or Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak , in internal exile in Sharm el-Sheikh . 
`` Possibly the only place he can go is Zimbabwe , '' he said . 
`` So there is no alternative . 
-LRB- If he is toppled -RRB- , he will be like Saddam Hussein and end up hiding in a hole . ''

Who in the West has the troops , the money and the will to take over nation-building in Libya once Muammar Cadaver falls ? 
No matter , because the Libyan people wo n't permit such foreign interference anyway . 
Libya is rushing headlong down a path similar to another failed state -- Afghanistan . 
Libya is demonstrating the awful truth that , as horrendously bad and evil as autocratic rulers like Muammar Cadaver are , it can get a hell of a lot worse . 
The huge wave sweeping the Middle East is going to wash over and obliterate Western strategic interests in the entire region , and beyond . 
The West has been caught massively on its heels , and can not hope to ride the crest of this wave . 
Instead , it 's being left to flounder in its wake . 
Nuker -- I am curious what you think SS `` caught massively on its heels '' should have done\/be doing differently ? 
Tough question to answer AFTER you 've fallen in a 20ft hole . 
But the U.S. should have seen this coming when the Soviet Union fell in 1989-1991 . 
That demonstrated the fact that peoples will allow oppression only for just so long . 
So the West should have begun back then to privately put increasing pressure on the oil-rich autocratic regimes to democratize . 
If no progress was evident after several years of effort , then it should have quietly but steadily positioned itself to be able to ride the crest of this wave whenever it inevitably would occur , and thus be looked to by the region 's peoples as the true champion of their freedoms and rights , rather than an interfering power that propped up autocrats perpetually . 
But , having utterly failed to look ahead and plan for this , the U.S. is really without options at present . 
All it can do is play a limited role in trying to limit the bloodshed and hope that the region 's peoples wo n't completely cast it and its strategic interests aside . 
Both Republican and Democratic administrations utterly failed us here -- none looked ahead and planned ahead sufficiently . 
This is scandalous considering the fact that the West is still utterly dependent upon oil , and will be for at least two more decades . 
This is what happens in the medium-to-long term when your words and your actions do n't even come close to matching up . 
The U.S. has proclaimed `` Democracy ! '' 
and `` Freedom ! '' 
and `` Human Rights ! '' 
while at the same time perpetually propping up insane , bloodthirsty dictators . 
The chickens have come home to roost .

2011-02-22,"By John D. Sutter , CNN Protestors in Egypt show their support for an ongoing anti-government demonstrations in neighboring Libya . 
CNN reporter says internet access has been cut Traffic monitors say access has been sporadic , cut most often at night The massive Saharan country , long controlled by the dictator Moammar Gadhafi , has suffered `` rolling blackouts '' of its internet connections during the regime 's ongoing violent crackdown on protestors , according to the internet traffic monitor Renesys . 
The cause of these internet service cuts , however , remains uncertain . 
Possibilities include a government crackdown , an internet traffic overload or simple power outages , said Jim Cowie , Renesys ' co-founder . 
`` If this had happened in any other country I might have said , ` Oh , that 's just a provider . 
Maybe they had a power outage in their data center and their servers would n't start up , '' he said . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman , one of the few independent journalists on the ground in eastern Libya , wrote that `` the electricity was working . 
The cell phone system is still functioning , though you ca n't call abroad . 
The internet , however , has been down for days . '' 
Google 's online `` Transparency Report '' shows internet searches from Libya , which is controlled by anti-government demonstrators , have been happening at below-average levels in recent days . 
And Arbor Networks , a network security company , issued similar findings . 
International internet traffic to and from Libya was shut down on Saturday morning from about 1 to 8 a.m. and again on Sunday during the same timeframe , according to Renesys ' analysis , which was posted on the company 's blog and is based on traffic data the company collects from internet service providers around the world . 
It 's almost as if the country had instituted a `` overnight internet curfew , '' Cowie said , adding it 's possible that Gadhafi 's government wanted to crack down on cyber dissidents who are known to organize online while other people sleep . 
Reports of wider-spread internet outages could be an indication that Libya is using more sophisticated methods to control the internet , some of which would n't be visible to international traffic monitors like Renesys . 
Iran , for example , is known for shutting down internet traffic at the neighborhood level , or removing capacity from the local internet to the point that local and international Web traffic simply overload the system , Cowie said . 
`` You remove capacity until everybody is squeezing through a small soda straw , '' he said . 
Libya 's internet blackouts are somewhat similar to those instituted by neighboring Egypt 's government during protests in that country . 
Egypt , however , completely shut down internet access for five days during protests against the regime of Hosni Mubarak , who was forced to resign after 30 years . 
That move appeared to be an attempt by the government to shut down access to blogs , e-mail , Facebook and Twitter , which were used heavily by some of the people who helped organize the anti-Mubarak protests which toppled his government after 18 days on the streets . 
Wael Ghonim , a prominent Egyptian protestor , issued a warning to other dictators in the Middle East and North Africa , saying , `` If you want to liberate a society , just give them the internet . '' 
It 's unclear how much of a role the internet and social media sites have played in organizing the protests in Libya . 
The news network Al-Jazeera reports Facebook was used to help coordinate the start of the protests in Libya , which went into full swing on February 17 . 
`` In a country where public dissent is rare , plans for Thursday 's protests were being circulated by anonymous activists on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter , '' the news organization writes . 
`` One Facebook group urging a ` Day of Anger ' in Libya , which had 4,400 members on Monday , saw that number more than double to 9,600 by Wednesday . '' 
Some authoritarian regimes restrict internet access , as was the case in Egypt , as a way to try to stay in power . 
Others , like Syria , China and Russia , filter some websites and use the internet as a way to monitor their citizens and steer public discourse . 
The internet infrastructure in Egypt and Libya is quite different , Cowie said . 
`` The key thing to remember is the massive difference in scale between the two countries . 
Egypt 's internet was thousands of prefixes . 
Libya 's internet is about a dozen prefixes , '' he said . 
An internet prefix is like an online ZIP code . 
It 's a number used to group devices that access the internet . 
Libya has 13 of these online zip codes out of the 400,000 internet prefixes that make up the entire internet , Cowie said . 
That makes the country a `` very small corner of a very big universe . '' 
Also of note : Only about 6 % of Libyans are on the internet , compared to nearly a quarter of people in Egypt , according to the ITU , an agency of the United Nations that focuses on the internet and communications . 
Libya 's access to the international internet is controlled by a single company , which is run by the state , Cowie said . 
That would make it easier , in theory , for the country to shut down internet connections than it was in Egypt , where the government had to call several internet service providers and order them to cut service as part of emergency law . 
Meanwhile , as Wired.com reports , a Twitter activist called Arasmus has created a map of the few unconfirmed internet reports that are coming out of Libya .

2011-02-22,"By the CNN Wire Staff UN wants end to Libyan violence World body , in a statement , `` expressed deep regret at the deaths of hundreds of civilians '' Council underscores the need to hold accountable those responsible for the violence United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a statement , the U.N. Security Council said it `` condemned the violence and use of force against civilians , deplored the repression against peaceful demonstrators and expressed deep regret at the deaths of hundreds of civilians '' in Libya . 
The council issued the statement shortly after its members were briefed on the situation in Libya by B. Lynn Pascoe , undersecretary general for political affairs . 
The council called on the Libyan government to protect Libyans and called upon authorities `` to act with restraint , to respect human rights and international humanitarian law and to allow immediate access to international human rights monitors and humanitarian agencies . '' 
The world body expressed concern about reports of shortages of medical supplies to treat the wounded and urged Libyan authorities to allow the safe passage into the country of medical and humanitarian supplies and workers . 
It added , `` They underscored the need to hold to account those responsible for attacks , including by forces under their control , on civilians . ''

2011-02-22,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libya Interior Minister joins revolution `` A sense of normalcy is returning , '' government spokesman says on TV Moammar Gadhafi `` will either commit suicide or he will get killed , '' says ex-interior minister `` Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people of Benghazi '' In eastern Libya , opposition leaders appear to be in firm control , CNN finds Tobruk , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's interior minister said Wednesday he has quit the government and is supporting the protesters , who he predicted will achieve victory in `` days or hours . '' 
Ex-Interior Minister Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi told CNN that he resigned Monday after hearing that some 300 unarmed civilians had been killed in Benghazi during the prior two to three days . 
He accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of planning to attack civilians on a wide scale . 
`` Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi , and I told him that he will have thousands of people killed if he does that , '' Abidi said in an Arabic-language telephone interview conducted Wednesday . 
Abidi said he now supports the people and the revolution . 
He called Gadhafi `` a stubborn man '' who will not give up . 
`` He will either commit suicide or he will get killed , '' said Abidi , who said he has known him since 1964 . 
Abidi predicted the revolution will succeed `` in a matter of days or hours , '' and he called on Libyan security forces `` to join the people in the intifada . '' 
Already , he said , `` many members '' of the security forces had defected , including those in the capital , Tripoli . 
He said the entire eastern part of the country is no longer under Gadhafi 's control and that security forces there have orders to never open fire on the people unless forced to do so in self-defense . 
Two people to watch Zakaria : ' I thought he was on drugs ' UN wants end to Libyan violence Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi -- Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi , now ex-interior minister The Libyan ambassador to the United States , Ali Aujali , also called for Gadhafi to resign , joining a chorus of Libyan officials , including the deputy ambassador to the United Nations , who say they now work for the Libyan people , not for Gadhafi . 
Among them was the Libyan ambassador to Bangladesh , A.H. Elimam , who resigned to side with pro-democracy protesters , said BSS , the official news agency of Bangladesh , citing a Foreign Ministry official Tuesday . 
Their announcements came eight days into protests that have cost Gadhafi control of eastern Libya and the support of other prominent Libyan officials worldwide and hours after Gadhafi delivered a defiant , rambling speech Tuesday , refusing calls to step down . 
`` This is my country , the country of my grandfathers , '' Gadhafi said in remarks carried live on Libyan state television . 
He vowed to die `` a martyr '' in his country . 
Blaming the unrest on `` rats '' who are `` agents '' of foreign intelligence services , Gadhafi said people found to be cooperating with outside forces fomenting discord and those who carry weapons against the country will be executed . 
The 68-year-old leader , who has been in power for nearly 42 years , spoke from a compound that U.S. warplanes bombed in 1986 , the Jamahiriya News Agency of Libya reported . 
The United States attacked the compound after implicating Libya in a discotheque bombing in West Berlin that resulted in the deaths of two U.S. service members . 
Libyan state TV described the crowds on the streets who were watching Gadhafi 's speech as his supporters ; an opposition leader said they had been dragged onto the streets . 
Some students at Tripoli 's Academy of Graduate Studies were offered free master 's degrees if they joined Gadhafi supporters in Green Square , a source said . 
Some people in Tripoli were offered money to put pictures of Gadhafi on their cars and go to Green Square , the source said . 
Moammar Gadhafi : An iron grip on Libya Will the military continue to comply ? 
A government spokesman , speaking on television , said Libyans were returning to their usual routine . 
`` A sense of normalcy is returning , '' he said . 
`` Some provisions are becoming shorter , but things will return to normalcy within a short period -- maybe a few days . '' 
He said Libyan authorities have asked those tribe members who have attacked barracks and police stations to return the weapons they had taken `` because security and safety will return to normal . '' 
Referring to reports that the military had attacked civilians , he said , `` We have reports and evidence they are not using arms unless against those who attacked the barracks . '' 
The spokesman said U.S. and Israeli intelligence operatives were behind the unrest . 
`` We will get rid of them , in collaboration with our people in the eastern province , '' he said . 
Despite such claims and even as he called on Libyans who `` love and support him '' to take to the streets and demonstrate for him , Gadhafi 's grip on power appeared to be weakening . 
In eastern Libya , groups of armed people wearing civilian clothing were guarding the streets as opposition leaders seemed to be in firm control , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . 
Wedeman was the first Western television correspondent to enter and report from Libya during the crisis . 
As Wedeman and his crew were entering the country , a young man at the border in civilian clothing and toting an AK-47 asked them for their passports . 
`` For what ? '' 
responded Wedeman 's driver . 
`` There is no government . 
What is the point ? '' 
They then drove in . 
On the Libyan side , there were `` no officials , no passport control , no customs , '' Wedeman reported . 
After meeting Tuesday in an emergency summit , the Arab League issued a statement suspending Libya 's participation in the body 's meetings and all the group 's agencies . 
The statement called for the immediate cessation of violence and condemned what it called crimes against protesters and peaceful strikers in Libya . 
It also asked Libyan authorities to lift the ban imposed on the media , to open communications and telephone networks and to ensure the delivery of emergency medical aid to the wounded . 
The U.N. Security Council met Tuesday in private -- the group 's first meeting since the wave of protests began rippling through Arab countries several weeks ago -- and then issued a statement condemning the violence in Libya . 
It called on authorities `` to act with restraint , to respect human rights and international humanitarian law and to allow immediate access to international human rights monitors and humanitarian agencies . '' 
Ibrahim Dabbashi , Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , said the statement `` was not strong enough , but I think it is a good message to the regime in Libya about stopping the bloodshed . '' 
Dabbashi said Monday that the death toll could be as high as 800 . 
Human Rights Watch said Monday that at least 233 people have been killed during the unrest . 
CNN has been in contact with medics and witnesses in Libya , whose accounts appear to corroborate the Human Rights Watch report . 
The rights group said Tuesday that witnesses in Tripoli `` have described Libyan forces firing ` randomly ' at protesters '' this week and that sources from two hospitals in Tripoli reported at least 62 bodies being taken to their morgues since February 20 . 
Witnesses have told CNN that helicopter gunships fired into crowds of protesters . 
Libya 's government denied it was turning its air force against civilians . 
Gadhafi 's second-oldest son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , told the state news agency Jamahiriya the warplanes were targeting weapons depots in remote areas . 
But one witness , who agreed to be identified only as Adam , said helicopters landed troops `` armed to the teeth '' in Tripoli 's Green Square on Monday . 
`` They have been using aerial tactics , along with men on the ground , to disperse and shoot indiscriminately into crowds , '' he said . 
The force included both government troops and mercenaries working for Gadhafi , he said . 
Residents responded by barricading themselves in their homes and setting up makeshift checkpoints to keep cars full of gunmen out of their neighborhoods . 
On Tuesday evening , some anti-government protesters began trying to gather in Tripoli and were fired on by people on foot wearing plainclothes , a witness said . 
The sounds of `` nonstop bullets '' could be heard throughout the capital , which the source described as `` electronic firing . '' 
At least some of the firing seemed to be coming from Green Square , the source said . 
Red cars drove through the streets of Tripoli and fired indiscriminately at people , a source in the capital said . 
Residents of Tripoli reported Tuesday a food shortage , gunfire and intimidation by security forces . 
Security forces cordoned off the Fashloom suburb of the capital and were shooting people on the streets , including those who were trying to retrieve bodies , said Mohamed Abdallah , spokesman for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya opposition group . 
Abdallah attributed the information to four witnesses on the ground . 
An opposition figure said some people were told the bodies of their loved ones would not be released unless they signed a form saying the person had died in surgery . 
CNN could not immediately confirm reports for most areas . 
The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . 
But CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . 
In eastern Libya , where Wedeman was reporting , residents said hundreds of mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa had been killed or captured while fighting for Gadhafi , but much of the army appeared to have switched over to anti-government forces . 
In Tobruk , demonstrators chanted the same slogans that were heard in recent days in Tunis , Tunisia , and Cairo , Egypt : `` The people want to topple the regime ! '' 
Here , the old Libyan flag now flies over the main square . 
The police station , a hated symbol of Gadhafi 's rule , has been ransacked . 
Other buildings were sacked , but banks and some other installations appeared untouched . 
People in Tobruk were threatening to cut off the export of oil from eastern Libya `` unless this massacre is stopped immediately , '' local leader Abdallah Sharif told CNN . 
But a U.S official with access to U.S. intelligence told CNN `` little to no disruption of Libyan oil production '' has been seen as a result of the unrest . 
And Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman , who was attending the International Energy Forum in Saudi Arabia , said U.S. officials had seen no evidence of an oil shortage . 
`` We believe there is a lot of product in the market , '' he said . 
Still , the senior source close to the Libyan government said ammunition depots had been attacked and ammunition and guns were `` everywhere . '' 
The source said the country was fighting `` Islamic extremists . '' 
The unrest in Libya has been fueled by protesters demanding freedom and decrying high unemployment . 
Even as Gadhafi tried to hold on to power , he attracted the ire of increasing numbers of Libyans worldwide . 
About 250 protesters stormed into the Libyan Embassy in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , on Tuesday , chanting and calling for Gadhafi to step down , a counselor at the embassy said . 
Osama Ahmed said most of the protesters were Libyan students studying in Malaysia . 
The protests were peaceful , he said . 
A top Libyan diplomat stationed in China said Tuesday he had resigned in protest of his government 's crackdown on protesters and called on Gadhafi to step down and leave the country . 
Hussein Sadiq al Musrati , who was the second secretary in the Libyan mission to Beijing before stepping down four days ago , joined about 20 students and protesters in front of the Libyan Embassy in Beijing on Tuesday . 
Demonstrators held signs that read , `` The game is over . 
Get out ... you 're finished . '' 
Adm. Mike Mullen , U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said the Libyan `` military firing on its own people , killing its own people is absolutely unacceptable . '' 
The situation `` needs to be resolved peacefully , '' he said .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi made a brief television appearance early Tuesday to announce that he was still in charge , denying reports that he had fled the country in the face of a spreading revolt . 
Speaking to a state television reporter in front of his Tripoli home , Gadhafi said he wanted to show people `` that I am in Tripoli , not in Venezuela . 
Do n't believe those dogs in the media . '' 
His 40-second appearance came after his government unleashed warplanes and helicopter gunships Monday in an attempt to bottle up the revolt that captured Benghazi , the country 's second-largest city , over the weekend . 
Witnesses said the aircraft were attacking anti-government demonstrators around Tripoli , the capital . 
Libya 's government denied it was turning its air force against civilians . 
Gadhafi 's son , Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi , told the state news agency Al-Jamahirya the warplanes were targeting weapons depots in remote areas . 
But one witness , who agreed to be identified only as `` Adam , '' said helicopters landed troops `` armed to the teeth '' in Tripoli 's Green Square on Monday to scatter anti-government protesters with automatic weapons and grenades . 
`` They have been using aerial tactics , along with men on the ground , to disperse and shoot indiscriminately into crowds , '' he said . 
The force included both government troops and mercenaries working for Gadhafi , he said . 
But residents were responding by barricading themselves in their homes and setting up makeshift checkpoints to keep cars full of gunmen out of their neighborhoods .

to Libyans : Do n't compromise In eastern Libya , groups of men in armed civilian clothing were guarding the streets , and opposition leaders appeared to be in firm control , CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman reported . 
Wedeman is the first Western television correspondent to enter and report from Libya during the crisis . 
Meanwhile , Gadhafi 's regime faced defections from prominent officials who declared their solidarity with the Libyan people . 
Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil resigned , saying he was protesting the `` bloody situation '' and `` use of excessive force '' against unarmed protesters , according to the Libyan newspaper Quryna . 
And Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations called the crackdown `` genocide , '' adding , `` The mass killing has reached a stage where no one can stay silent about it . '' 
`` Whenever people are getting to the streets , whenever they are demonstrating peacefully , the army and militias are shooting at them , '' the diplomat , Ibrahim Dabbashi , told CNN on Monday . 
But Gadhafi `` can not survive '' this uprising , Dabbashi said . 
`` The Libyan people are determined to get rid of him . 
It 's a matter of time . 
I do n't know how long it will last , but it will be soon , '' he said . 
The U.N. Security Council scheduled a Tuesday morning meeting on Libya at Dabbashi 's request , the first time the council has held consultations over any of the revolts that have swept the Arab world since January . 
Moammar Gadhafi : An iron grip on Libya 2009 : Gadhafi says he leads a revolution ... whenever they are demonstrating peacefully , the army and militias are shooting at them -- Ibrahim Dabbashi , Libya 's deputy ambassador to the U.N. CNN could not immediately confirm reports for most areas beyond Benghazi . 
The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country , though CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . 
Libyan state television reported that government security forces were demanding citizens ' cooperation . 
It showed a crowd in Green Square chanting pro-government slogans and holding a sign supporting the regime . 
But a woman in Tripoli reported that warplanes and helicopters were attacking parts of the capital , and armed men in cars were firing at anyone on the streets . 
The leader of an opposition movement told CNN that helicopter gunships were firing into crowds , and two Libyan pilots defected to Malta after being asked to bomb Libyan citizens , a Maltese government source said . 
The defecting pilots ' French-built Mirage F1 jets were armed with rockets and loaded machine guns when they landed in Malta , the Maltese source said . 
Video posted on YouTube showed what CNN was told were the charred remains of six Libyan troops in open body bags . 
Opposition sources in Libya say the dead were soldiers who refused to shoot at anti-government demonstrators . 
The minute-long video was captured on a mobile phone camera and posted on Monday , but it was not clear when it was taken . 
It depicts a crowd gathered around the bodies , which were burned beyond recognition , and the opposition sources said many more bodies were found in an adjacent military barracks . 
Citing hospital sources , Human Rights Watch said Monday that at least 233 people had been killed in the past week of upheaval . 
CNN has been in communication with medics and witnesses in Libya , whose accounts appear to corroborate the Human Rights Watch report , but Dabbashi said the toll could be as high as 800 . 
Libya is the latest Arab nation to fall into turmoil since January 's ouster of Tunisian strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . 
Similar protests toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on February 12 and have spread across the region from Morocco to Bahrain . 
Gadhafi has ruled Libya since a 1969 coup d'etat , but questions about his whereabouts swirled Monday after his son delivered a televised address on the crisis . 
In that speech , the younger Gadhafi acknowledged that protesters had seized heavy weapons from government troops in Benghazi and that the country faced a civil war that could smash it to pieces and release `` rivers of blood . '' 
`` We have a very dangerous decision to make , '' said Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the country 's `` general coordinator '' and one of his father 's top lieutenants . 
`` We are all the same , we all have weapons , we are all Libyans , and this is our country , our homeland . '' 
U.N. General-Secretary Ban Ki-moon `` had an extensive discussion '' with the Libyan leader Monday , the United Nations said . 
Ban `` expressed deep concern at the escalating scale of violence and emphasized that it must stop immediately , '' a U.N. spokesman said . 
`` He reiterated his call for respect for basic freedoms and human rights , including peaceful assembly and information , '' the spokesman said , and Ban `` underlined the need to ensure the protection of the civilian population under any circumstances . '' 
Quryna , a traditionally pro-government organ that did not mention the protests when they began last week , reported that African mercenaries had opened fire on unarmed civilians in Tajouraa , about 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . 
A Quryna reporter also said snipers had shot an unarmed woman in the same area . 
In Tripoli , a woman who asked not to be identified reported seeing violence in the streets . 
`` I 've seen myself red Hyundai cars with tinted windows that had armed people inside it shooting random people , '' she told CNN in a telephone interview . 
`` Three victims have fallen in the street where I live . '' 
During a meeting with EU ambassadors in Tripoli , Prime Minister Baghdadi Mahmudi blamed the upheaval on `` terrorists and destructive plans '' and stressed that Libya has the right to `` take any measures '' to protect its unity , stability , people and resources , Libyan state television reported . 
The Arab League will hold an urgent summit Tuesday to discuss Libya , Egypt 's official news agency MENA reported Monday , and Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa called for an end to the violence . 
He criticized the younger Gadhafi 's assertion during a speech early Monday that Tunisians and Egyptians were to blame for Libya 's revolt , saying demands for reform , development and change were the `` legitimate rights '' of the Arab people . 
In Washington , the United States condemned the violence and called for a halt to the `` unacceptable bloodshed '' in response to civil unrest , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement . 
`` The government of Libya has a responsibility to respect the universal rights of the people , including the right to free expression and assembly , '' Clinton 's statement said .

2011-02-22,"The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist . 
The opinions expressed are her own . 
LONDON -- Chaos in Libya could pose a threat to Mediterranean economies . 
The unrest in the oil-rich North African country , and the subsequent bloody reaction of its authoritarian regime , could soon present a serious strategic challenge for Western governments and corporate titans that recently embraced the long-pariah state . 
But it is Italy , the country 's former colonial ruler , which looks set to bear the brunt of the fallout if the situation descends into uncontrolled turmoil . 
Four decades of rule under unpredictable Muammar Gaddafi quite expectedly failed to deliver the Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution 's vision of a `` state of the masses '' or `` people 's capitalism '' . 
In one of the most corrupt countries in the world , wealth from the economy , which accounts for 2 percent of global oil production , is hardly visible among the population of 6 million . 
Despite its massive failings , Libya , as other similar countries , has won praise from the International Monetary Fund . 
The country 's relationship with Western powers deepened after U.N. sanctions against were lifted in 2003 . 
The United States has increased its oil imports from the country , and unsavoury government dealings have helped the likes of British oil giant BP push on with a $ 900 million exploration contract in Libya . 
The country 's strongest external ties , however , remain with Italy . 
Libya is a prominent feature on the Italian corporate landscape , with stakes in carmaker Fiat , banking group UniCredit and even the Juventus football team . 
Italian oil giant Eni has a 14 billion euro investment program in the country , as well as supply contracts stretching to 2047 . 
Overall Libyan oil accounts for around 27 percent of Italy 's consumption . 
Threats from Gaddafi 's son that the country 's oil `` will be burned '' can not be taken lightly . 
Even if Libya does n't descend into all-out civil war , it can afford a prolonged period of disruption despite its economy 's absolute dependence on oil production . 
The country 's net foreign assets are estimated to total $ 150 billion -- or enough to cover 37 months of imports . 
Italy 's politicians are reluctant to condemn Tripoli , but after the country 's decision to open fire on anti-government protestors , companies will have to weigh the dubious attraction of counting Libya amongst their shareholders . 
Energy investments could also now be threatened if sanctions are re-imposed . 
Meanwhile the near 2 percent jump in oil prices seems to suggest markets are n't overly optimistic . 
Greedy oil cartel members will quickly capitalize on high prices to capture a windfall . 
Thus , I do n't think that oil supplies anywhere will be threatened . 
And as a bonus , those producers will be applauded for `` stepping up to the plate '' and being a stabilizing force on the world economy , in a time of need . 
It 's a perfect play . 
Oil supplies on the planet are not unlimited -- the reason oilman George Bush used his presidency to invade a big oil producer unrelated to 911 -- US Companies ran out of accessible supplies and needed a new source . 
Tensions in the Middle East between the poor and the autocratic elite and their well-paid supporters have been building for decades -- the results now painfully apparent . 
And there is the Inconvenient Truth of global warmin -- caused by carbon-based fuels . 
So now we have the Perfect Storm unfolding before our very eyes . 
Do n't count on oil supplies or prices ever stabilizing again . 
Instead you will be forced to transition -- evolve -- to energy sources and production with a Green Footprint . 
Despite its massive failings , Libya , as other similar countries , has won praise from the International Monetary Fund . 
It 's too bad that Ms Galani did n't flesh this one out a little more . 
I suspect that the IMF 's focus is mainly on debt levels for any given nation , and obviously one that lives within its means , as most oil nations will , gets a thumbs up from them . 
So people reading that statement will gain a prejudiced view of the IMF as if it is complicit in supporting corruption in Libya , while that could hardly be the case . 
The IMF is merely a banker of last resort , as far as I can see , unless the institution is more politicized than I have been led to believe . 
This seems a very fair and even analysis and I doubt if the IMF comment will change any opinions about the debt merchants the IMF protects as last resort . 
The article and comments seem to ignore the fact that six million residents of Libya must do something , besides pounding sand , to improve their lives and add assets to Libya or to Qdufus and sons . 
This article has some nice tid bits of economic info that the general public should be aware of ; especially those who do n't know that Tripoli has been a pirate haven for generations .

2011-02-22,"LONDON | Tue Feb 22 , 2011 2:10 pm GMT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Powerful military elites ultimately decided the outcome of Egypt and Tunisia 's revolutions , but in Libya it is the much more opaque and complex tribal power structures that could decide how events play out . 
Colonel Muammar Gaddafi has long relied on his immediate -- but small -- Qathathfa tribe to staff elite military units and guarantee his personal security and that of his government , experts say . 
But that is seen unlikely to be enough to secure the country . 
More important are the larger tribes long co-opted into his rule such as the Wafalla , who make up an estimated 1 million of Libyan 's more than 6 million population . 
Some rumors suggest the ferocity of Gaddafi 's crackdown on his own people may already be prompting tribal leaders to switch allegiance . 
`` In Libya , it will be the tribal system that will hold the balance of power rather than the military , '' said Alia Brahimi , head of the North Africa program at the London School of Economics . 
`` I think you will see defections of some of the main tribes if that is not happening already . 
It looks like he has already lost control of the east of the country where he was never popular and never fully managed to consolidate his power . '' 
Eastern Libya is the site of much of its oil reserves . 
On Tuesday , a Reuters correspondent reported that Gaddafi 's forces appeared to have abandoned their positions on the border with Egypt which were now in the hands of men armed with clubs and Kalashnikovs who said they were opposed to his rule . 
Who , if anyone , those men were answering to was not immediately clear . 
While herder and tribal lifestyles have declined in Libya in the face of rising oil-fueled urbanization , traditional power structures are said to remain strong beneath the surface . 
In Egypt and Tunisia , the armies proved to be the supreme political force , easing unpopular leaders Hosni Mubarak and Ben Ali from office in part due to their reluctance to fire on protesters . 
Libya is very different , however . 
Long largely closed to outsiders , details of its complex mix of alliances and loyalties are scarce . 
Experts generally agree part of Gaddafi 's strategy for retaining power has been to keep his own tribe in important positions . 
Key members of his family are said to command their own military formations , again usually members of their own Qathathfa tribe . 
Once largely nomadic herders , the Qathathfa were sidelined by Libya 's former monarchy but allowed to join the armed forces and police , then considered secondary organizations . 
Having risen through the military structure himself , Gaddafi is seen to have tried to emasculate it to prevent rival commanders from threatening him . 
Memorably , he abolished all ranks above his own position of colonel . 
Gaddafi 's unique `` Green Book , '' containing his political philosophy and system of government , vows to put an end to tribalism but in reality experts say it entrenched it . 
`` Gaddafi has largely dismissed the older tribal military structures but they will probably not have huge problems finding weapons , '' said the LSE 's Brahimi . 
`` Defections from the military will be key to this . '' 
Parts of the military had long appeared reluctant to use excessive force against their own people , she said . 
Popular rumor held that Gaddafi was forced to rely on Serbian mercenary pilots to bomb civilian areas during offensives against Islamist militancy in the 1990s . 
Some say Gaddafi 's tribal strategy has effectively amounted to a system of divide and rule , buying off particularly established tribal leaders from key groups . 
In recent years , they say , control has been faltering and recent events may accelerate this . 
`` Gaddafi made sure to keep the people aware of their tribal divisions , winning the alliance of larger ones and hence keeping the population under control , '' wrote Jerusalem-based journalist Lisa Goldman after a Skype conversation with a Libyan contact she said was well placed to talk on some military matters . 
`` Although the larger ones like the Werfalees and the Megrahees were privileged with power and money , his recent actions angered these tribes and for the first time in decades tribal barriers have withered away . 
People are uniting with other formerly rival tribes or even different ethnicities like the Amazeegh or Berbers . '' 
If Gaddafi can persuade other tribes to stay loyal to him , most experts believe he will probably try to arm them directly , raising the risks of ethnic conflict that could tear the country apart , send refugees pouring into its neighbors and jeopardize oil supplies . 
Gaddafi 's opponents accuse him of bringing in mercenaries from elsewhere in Africa , perhaps veterans of civil wars in the Sahel and West Africa . 
`` There 's a lot of weapons in the country and Gaddafi has armed tribes before that have supported him , '' said Geoff Porter , North Africa analyst and contributor to political risk consultancy Wikistrat . 
`` We could see something more along the lines of Lebanon 's civil war -- a prolonged period of violence and bloodshed . ''

2011-02-23,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libya Interior Minister joins revolution Libyan state TV reports `` gangs '' in Benghazi kidnapped Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi Earlier Wednesday , al Abidi said he quit the government and supports protesters He predicted protesters will achieve victory in `` days or hours '' -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hours after Libya 's former interior minister said he resigned to support anti-government protesters , the Libyan government said he had been kidnapped . 
Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi told CNN Wednesday that he resigned Monday after hearing that 300 unarmed civilians had been killed in Benghazi , Libya 's second-largest city . 
He accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of planning to attack civilians on a wide scale . 
But the same day , Libyan state media reported that `` gangs '' in Benghazi had kidnapped him . 
Witnesses have reported that Benghazi has essentially been taken over by the opposition . 
Witnesses also told CNN they saw Younis on Sunday and Monday in Benghazi , where he was siding with the protesters . 
CNN could not immediately confirm reports for areas beyond Benghazi . 
The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country . 
CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . 
Two people to watch Gadhafi : ' I will be a martyr ' Libyan protests threaten oil prices Eastern Libyan : I 'm a free man Libyan state television added that Libyan forces have warned those responsible for the kidnapping that they `` will be chased in their hiding places . '' 
Earlier Wednesday , al Abidi said he had quit the government and is supporting the protesters , who he predicted will achieve victory in `` days or hours . '' 
`` Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi , and I told him that he will have thousands of people killed if he does that , '' al Abidi said in an Arabic-language telephone interview Wednesday . 
He called Gadhafi `` a stubborn man '' who will not give up . 
`` He will either commit suicide or he will get killed , '' said al Abidi , who said he has known him since 1964 . 
Al Abidi called on Libyan security forces `` to join the people in the intifada . '' 
Already , he said , `` many members '' of the security forces had defected , including those in the capital , Tripoli . 
Since the recent protests in Libya started February 15 , a growing number of Libyan officials have reportedly resigned . 
Libya 's ambassador to Bangladesh , A.H. Elimam , resigned to side with pro-democracy protesters , said BSS , the official news agency of Bangladesh , citing a Foreign Ministry official Tuesday . 
CNN 's Waffa Munayyer contributed to this report .

2011-02-23,"Reports : Libyan pilots refuse to bomb city , eject from plane Even as Moammar Gadhafi called on the military to crack down on anti-government protesters , reports emerged Wednesday that the Libyan leader was facing growing international and domestic opposition , including from his own military . 
An opposition figure told CNN that a pilot who had been ordered to bomb oil fields southwest of Benghazi refused to do so and instead ejected from the plane . 
Citing military sources , the Libyan newspaper Quryna reported that the two people aboard -- the pilot and co-pilot -- parachuted out and that the plane then crashed into an uninhabited area west of Ajdabiya , 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- southwest of Benghazi . 
Quryna itself is a sign of the changes sweeping through Libya . 
When protests began last week , it carried regime propaganda . 
But it later reported on the protests and casualty figures . 
CNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya . 
The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country . 
CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . 
A Libyan Arab Airlines plane was denied permission to land in Malta on Wednesday , Maltese government sources said . 
Permission was denied for `` clearance reasons , '' because officials did not know who was on board , the sources said . 
Meanwhile , Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini characterized the situation as a civil war , `` with the authorities of the capital ordering attacks against the same Libyan people -- bombings and acts of unprecedented violence . '' 
In a speech to the Italian Senate , Frattini said , `` Unconfirmed reports spoke of 1,000 deaths ; other sources have given even higher figures . '' 
He said the claim from official sources that put the total number of deaths nationwide at 200 to 300 deaths `` frankly lacks credibility . '' 
The head of the largest trauma hospital in Benghazi told CNN on Wednesday that 202 people have been confirmed dead in the city since protests began last week . 
The opposition now controls Benghazi and much of the rest of eastern Libya . 
On Wednesday , the ninth day of protests , Gadhafi faced more defections from within his regime and new international pressure to halt military actions against demonstrators .

2011-02-23,"Gadhafi in 2005 : To suggest Libya is not a democracy would be an insult He used elaborate fly whisk to wave away insects that were n't there Despite eccentricities , author Kenneth Timmerman says Gadhafi is cunning In 2005 Libya was a rogue state trying to redeem itself -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is the strangest head of state I 've ever met . 
When I asked him about Libyan democracy he threatened to sue . 
`` If you or someone else says that Libya is not a democracy then it would be considered an insult , '' he said . 
`` We could go to court to redeem honor from that insult . '' 
The conversation was back in 2005 at his tent in Tripoli , a single-room structure made of colorful textiles in the middle of a heavily guarded compound . 
We sat on plastic garden furniture that had been carefully hand-cleaned by a man in an orderly 's uniform , while a small goat picked at patchy grass outside . 
Gadhafi is famous for his odd behavior , female bodyguards and bizarre ideas such as his plan to abolish Switzerland . 
We only saw very conventional male bodyguards . 
But even with their protection , Gadhafi 's manner made it hard to understand how he managed to stay in power for more than four decades . 
He did n't seem up to it . 
He appeared lethargic and his eyes , even behind sunglasses , seemed unfocused . 
2005 : Gadhafi on ending nuclear program His answers , through a translator , seemed rambling . 
Author Kenneth Timmerman , who has also met him , says Gadhafi has kept power through cunning . 
`` He 's a very , very skilled player , '' Timmerman said . 
`` He divides the country . 
He conquers the small groups . 
He 's kept the tribes squabbling amongst themselves , and up until relatively recently he has distributed some of the oil wealth to the people . '' 
Human rights groups also say that Gadhafi 's regime has killed , jailed and tortured its opponents . 
Libya today is in turmoil . 
Back then , it was in transition , a rogue state trying to redeem itself . 
Pressed by international sanctions , it had abandoned support for terrorist organizations , surrendered its weapons of mass destruction to the West and was trying to open-up its economy . 
Gadhafi told me he was angry that Libya never got the payoff it expected : U.S. esteem and investment . 
In part it was because Washington 's attention had turned to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
But it was also , no doubt , because no American president or politician would be eager to embrace the man Ronald Reagan once called a `` mad dog . '' 
In any country or company 's plans for Libya , Moammar Gadhafi was the wildcard , the unpredictable element .

The head of the largest trauma hospital in Benghazi told CNN on Wednesday that 202 people have been confirmed dead in the city since protests began last week . 
The opposition now controls Benghazi and much of the rest of eastern Libya . 
On Wednesday , the ninth day of protests , Gadhafi faced more defections from within his regime and new international pressure to halt military actions against demonstrators . 
Uncertainty surrounded the whereabouts of one prominent defector . 
Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi , the country 's interior minister , told CNN Wednesday in a telephone interview that he had resigned Monday and was supporting the opposition after hearing that 300 unarmed civilians had been killed in Benghazi . 
`` Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi and I told him that he will have thousands of people killed if he does that , '' al Abidi said . 
He accused Gadhafi of planning to attack civilians on a wide scale but predicted that protesters would emerge victorious in `` days or hours . '' 
But hours after that interview , the Libyan government announced Wednesday that the former interior minister had been kidnapped . 
State media reported that `` gangs '' had abducted him in Benghazi . 
But Benghazi , now solidly in the camp of the protesters , was peaceful Wednesday . 
The only shooting that could be heard was celebratory gunfire . 
Crowds cheered as international journalists drove through the city , thanked them for arriving and threw them candy . 
Absent Gadhafi 's influence , residents formed ad hoc committees to take over the business of running the city , ensuring that hospitals were adequately staffed and supplied , banks were protected , electricity was flowing and garbage was picked up . 
They also formed a security force to defend the city in the event that forces loyal to Gadhafi were to attack . 
Gadhafi : Profile of a dictator Can Gadhafi survive ? 
Two people to watch Gadhafi : ' I will be a martyr ' Libyan protests threaten oil prices One member of the ad hoc government said forces here have been in telephone contact with tribes in the west of the country , many of whom remained loyal to Gadhafi , and have tried to persuade them to reject him . 
In New York , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon left no doubt about where the world body stands on Libya . 
`` The reported nature and scale of the attacks on civilians are egregious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law , '' he told reporters . 
`` I condemn them loudly and without qualification . 
Those responsible must be held accountable in courts of law . '' 
He noted that the Security Council and the League of Arab States on Tuesday each issued strong statements on the matter . 
`` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . 
`` The government of Libya must meet its responsibility to protect its people . '' 
Ban added that he was sending his senior advisers to the region . 
In Washington , President Barack Obama said the United States condemns the use of violence . 
`` The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous and it is unacceptable , '' he told reporters as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stood beside him . 
Libya `` must be held accountable '' for its failure to meet its responsibilities , he said , adding , `` The entire world is watching . '' 
He said he was sending Clinton to Geneva for international meetings about Libya . 
The United States is considering a range of tools to pressure Libya to end the violence and respect the rights of its people , U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Wednesday . 
`` That certainly includes sanctions that could be imposed either bilaterally or multilaterally , '' Crowley said . 
Peru and Botswana announced they were breaking diplomatic ties with Libya . 
Peruvian President Alan Garcia said his country suspended diplomatic relations after condemning `` the repression unleashed by Gadhafi . '' 
Botswana 's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement that it was joining the international community , `` which is calling for action to be taken against those persons who have committed crimes against humanity in the continuing conflict in Libya and hopes that such persons shall be referred to the International Criminal Court to account for their deeds . '' 
But ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo noted that Libya is not a party to the Rome Statute , which set up the court . 
`` Intervention by the ICC on the alleged crimes committed in Libya can occur only if the Libyan authorities accept the jurisdiction of the court , '' his statement said . 
`` In the absence of such step , the United Nations Security Council can decide to refer the situation to the court . 
The Office of the Prosecutor will act only after either decision is taken . '' 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for prompt European Union sanctions against Libya on Wednesday , such as `` a ban on access to EU territory and financial monitoring . '' 
Residents in the Libyan capital of Tripoli heard sporadic gunshots overnight , a resident said Wednesday . 
By daybreak , the main roads in the city had been `` cleaned off as if nothing happened , '' she said . 
More checkpoints have been set up , especially near the city center , restricting residents ' movements , she said . 
And a food shortage is getting worse , she said . 
When her family tried Wednesday morning to buy bread , they found the bakeries were closed . 
Police cars and downed trees blocked many of the roads in the neighborhoods , and security officials were not allowing pictures to be taken . 
Witnesses reported seeing about 10 burned-out civilian cars and bodies lying in the streets . 
Many of the streets were stained with blood , a witness said . 
In Tripoli 's Dahra neighborhood , people driving white vans cleared away makeshift barricades , a witness said . 
Wednesday evening , planes circled overhead and shots were fired , though it was n't clear whether the shots were coming from the air or the ground , a witness said . 
The streets were largely deserted , but one man could be heard in the street screaming in Arabic , `` There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet ! '' 
-- a liturgical slogan often invoked by Muslims in challenging situations , the witness said . 
Witnesses said security forces increased their presence after Gadhafi defended his regime in a defiant speech Tuesday . 
He vowed to die a `` martyr '' and blamed the unrest on `` rats '' who are `` agents '' of foreign intelligence services . 
He warned that people found to be cooperating with outside forces fomenting discord and those who carry weapons against the country will be executed . 
A government spokesman blamed U.S. and Israeli intelligence operatives for the unrest . 
`` We will get rid of them , in collaboration with our people in the eastern province , '' he said . 
Referring to reports that the military had attacked civilians , the spokesman said , `` We have reports and evidence they are not using arms unless against those who attacked the barracks . '' 
The government version of events differed markedly from what witnesses reported , including helicopter gunships firing into crowds of protesters . 
Those caught up in the unrest include asylum seekers and refugees , the U.N. refugee agency said , as it urged neighboring countries not to turn them away . 
Speaking to reporters in Geneva , Switzerland , the chief spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said she had received troubling reports about their plight . 
`` A journalist has passed information to us from Somalis in Tripoli who say they are being hunted on suspicion of being mercenaries , '' Melissa Fleming said . 
`` He says they feel trapped and are frightened to go out , even though there is little or no food at home . '' 
The U.N. refugee agency praised Tunisia and Egypt for `` positive indications '' that they will keep their borders open to people fleeing Libya . 
The agency 's staff is working at the Tunisian border to monitor the situation and identify `` vulnerable individuals for whom immediate assistance is needed -- such as children without parents , women with children , and the elderly , '' the agency said in a statement . 
An English-speaking Egyptian fleeing Libya told CNN of systematic destruction of cell phone cards and cell phone memory chips at checkpoints on the road to the border with Tunisia . 
He also reported thousands of people gathering at the Tripoli airport , both inside and outside . 
Meanwhile , the United Nations terminated Gadhafi 's daughter 's stint as a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. Development Program . 
U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said Aisha Gadhafi was appointed goodwill ambassador for Libya in 2009 to address HIV\/AIDS and violence against women in the country . 
Nesirky said the U.N. agency ended its agreement with her given recent events in Libya . 
In an interview on Libyan state-run television , Aisha Gadhafi said she had heard the news . 
`` I ca n't verify if it 's true or not , but all the Libyans who know me ... know that I am the goodwill ambassador with or without the United Nations . '' 
On Wednesday , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad urged leaders of regional countries to let people express their opinions , according to the Islamic Republic News Agency . 
The Iranian official news agency also reported that Ahmadinejad wondered how the ruler of a country could kill his own people using guns and tanks . 
But after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's regime was toppled this month following 18 days of protests , Iranian protesters emulated them by taking to the streets , where they were met with force .

2011-02-23,"By the CNN Wire Staff Report : Pilot refused to bomb , crashes -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Libyan military aircraft crashed Wednesday southwest of Benghazi after the crew refused to follow orders to bomb the city , Libya 's Quryna newspaper reported . 
The pilot and co-pilot parachuted out of the craft , and the plane crashed in an uninhabited area , the paper said . 
The Russian-made Sukhoi-22 aircraft crashed west of the city of Ijdabiya , 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- southwest of Benghazi , Quryna reported , citing military sources . 
When the protests began , Quryna reported regime propaganda . 
But it later switched , reporting on the protests and casualty figures . 
CNN could not immediately confirm reports for many areas in Libya . 
The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country .

2011-02-23,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Wed Feb 23 , 2011 6:29 pm EST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyans celebrated the liberation of the east of the country from the rule of Muammar Gaddafi , who has vowed to crush the revolt and on Wednesday was trying to assert his grip on the capital Tripoli , in the west . 
Lying between Egypt and Tunisia , where a wave of Arab unrest has unseated two veteran presidents , the desert nation of six million which Gaddafi has ruled for 41 years seemed split in two , trapping thousands of foreign workers , jeopardizing oil exports and raising fears of tribal conflict and civil war . 
The United States , which once branded Gaddafi a `` mad dog '' but had joined European powers ' reconciliation to exploit Libya 's oil wealth , said it might impose sanctions to help end violence which one European minister said may have cost 1,000 people . 
President Barack Obama , who lacks the influence in Libya that U.S. aid gives him over some other Arab states , called for international unity to end the violence . 
He did not say Gaddafi should go , but said he would be held accountable for any abuses . 
`` It is imperative that the nations and peoples of the world speak with one voice , '' Obama told reporters at the White House in his first public comments on the revolt . 
`` The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous . '' 
Other foreign leaders , who also embraced Gaddafi , and his oil , after decades of isolating a leader who aided militants around the world , also voiced concern at the level of violence , which has included aerial bombing in parts of some cities . 
Differences over how to proceed , some driven by concern not to jeopardize the safety of foreigners caught up in the trouble , appear to limit prospects for immediate , concerted international action , although some analysts have suggested that even military force might be applied to protect the rebel east from Gaddafi . 
France called outright for sanctions . 
Obama said he would look at a `` full range of options . '' 
U.S. officials said sanctions were among those being considered . 
In the eastern city of Benghazi , cradle of the uprising and home to tribes long hostile to the 68-year-old leader , thousands filled the streets , lighting fireworks and waving the red , black and green flag of the king Colonel Gaddafi overthrew in 1969 . 
`` We have been suffering for 41 years , '' said 45-year-old Hamida Muftah . 
`` Gaddafi has killed people ... We are a very rich country , but most of the people are poorer than poor . '' 
A medical official said about 320 had been killed in Benghazi since protests against oppression and poverty began last week . 
Libya 's Quryna newspaper quoted a military source as saying a bomber crew bailed out and left their aircraft to crash rather than bomb Benghazi . 
Earlier in the week , two pilots flew their planes to Malta to avoid , they said , attacking their own people . 
In Tripoli , which remained largely closed to foreign media , local journalists said streets were calm after sporadic violence in recent days . 
Gaddafi 's state television channel showed dozens of loyalists waving his portrait and chanting his praises . 
`` Lots of people are afraid to leave their homes in Tripoli and pro-Gaddafi gunmen are roaming around threatening any people who gather in groups , '' said Tunisian Marwan Mohammed , who was crossing the border home after leaving the Libyan capital . 
Gaddafi 's children spoke up in defense of the man who went on television on Tuesday to fulminate against `` terrorists '' and promise to `` cleanse Libya house by house . '' 
They also sought to tell viewers foreign media were misreporting the week 's events . 
`` Libyans are the victims of the biggest joke , '' his son Saif al-Islam , once seen as a reformer , told state television . 
`` So wake up . 
The truths start today . 
You will see it with your own eyes , tomorrow and after tomorrow . '' 
Another son , former professional footballer Saadi , told the Financial Times that Saif al-Islam was drafting a constitution to `` bring in new blood to govern our country , '' adding : `` My father would stay as the big father who advises . '' 
He acknowledged aircraft bombed areas around Benghazi but said they hit only bases to prevent Islamist radicals seizing arms . 
He said his father would regain control of the east : `` When the people see the army , they will be afraid . '' 
Gaddafi 's daughter Aisha also appeared on state television , denying a report she tried to flee to Malta . 
`` I am steadfastly here , '' she said . 
She added she was unaware of a report she had been dropped by the United Nations as a goodwill ambassador . 
Others have deserted Gaddafi 's side , however . 
Interior Minister Abdel Fattah Younes al Abidi and a senior aide to Saif al-Islam joined them : `` I resigned from the Gaddafi Foundation on Sunday to express dismay against violence , '' Youssef Sawani , executive director of the foundation , told Reuters by SMS . 
Gaddafi has deployed troops to the west of the capital to try to stop the revolt that started in the east from spreading . 
In the east , many soldiers have withdrawn from active service . 
General Soliman Mahmoud al-Obeidy told Reuters in Tobruk in the east that the Libyan leader was no longer trustworthy . 
`` I am sure he will fall in the coming days , '' he said . 
Oil prices climbed above $ 111 a barrel at their highest since mid-2008 amid fears chaos could spread to other oil-producing countries and choke supplies , which could dash hopes of a quick global economic recovery . 
Trade sources said at least three oil cargoes did make it out of Libyan ports over the 24 hours to mid-Wednesday , however . 
Up to a quarter of Libya 's oil production has been closed down , based on calculations from firms in the country , which stretches from the Mediterranean into the Sahara and supplies nearly 2 percent of world oil output . 
Countries with strong business ties to Africa 's third largest oil producer scrambled to evacuate thousands of citizens and a Turkish worker was shot dead at a building site near the capital , Turkish officials said . 
A British oil worker said 300 people were stranded at a camp in the east of Libya , where he said local people had looted oil installations . 
`` We are living every day in fear of our lives as the local people are armed , '' James Coyle told the BBC . 
An estimated 1.5 million foreign nationals are working or traveling in Libya and a third of the population of 7 million are immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa . 
Witnesses described scenes of chaos as people tried to leave . 
`` It 's a biblical exodus , '' said Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , predicting several hundred thousand would seek refuge in Italy . 
The U.N. Security Council condemned the use of violence and called for those responsible for attacks on civilians to be held to account . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron called for a formal resolution . 
`` The Libyan regime is using appalling levels of force and violence against its own people including using airplanes that are shooting at people , '' he said . 
But in the latest sign of international division over how to deal with Gaddafi , the prime minister of Qatar said he did not want to isolate Libya , where several senior officials have declared their backing for protests that began about a week ago .

2011-02-24,"Huckabee 's comments included criticizing President Obama over Libya , taking aim at fellow potential presidential candidate Mitch Daniels on social issues , and Mitt Romney on the issue of health care . 
On his feelings about the Libya crisis : `` I think I 'd make it very clear that the United States is not going to stand by and watch a country slaughter its own people in cold blood , that there is a sense in which there 's a virtual genocide going on . 
I 'm still hopeful that Libya 's army will take Gadhafi out and I think that 's the solution we can all hope for . 
There 's clearly a man who has virtually escaped the asylum who is in a position of extraordinary power . '' 
`` But when a person starts talking about killing his own citizens and then following up on it , creating rivers of blood in his own streets and blowing up the one resource that his country has to give it a foundation for any economic hope , he 's clearly a mad man and this is a person who is maniacal and now we are beginning to learn that he did in fact order the bombing of Pan Am 103 over the Lockabee , the disco in Berlin . 
You know these are acts of international terrorism and I expect more than a strongly worded letter from the UN . '' 
On what actions he 'd take toward Libya if he was president : `` I think a no-fly zone would be absolute -- yeah a no fly zone very important because that way you keep him from flying mercenaries in , maybe even a naval armada somewhere off the 3 mile international boundaries , just as a presence , and even to say we stand ready to do what is necessary to make sure there 's not an act of genocide against those people . '' 
On whether President Obama is being too timid in his handling of the crisis : `` In light of the urgency , but I do n't have the NSA report sitting in front of me . 
So I 'm always a little careful to say , here 's what I would do , because I think you have to base a decision based on good intelligence and information which a person in my capacity as an ordinary citizen at this point simply does n't have . '' 
On the role his new book plays in his presidential decision-making process : `` This is the message . 
If people read this book and say those are some ideas I can relate to , these are ideas I think would be good for the country , then that 's going to help me believe that there is real support for what I stand for . 
I do n't think politics and running for president is just about can I go through the political manipulations to get the job . 
It 's , if I get that job , do the people of the country support what I would do and I think I owe it to them to say , ` Here 's what I do , here 's where I stand . 
These are my principals . ' '' 
On Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels ' call for a `` truce '' on social issues until economic problems are dealt with : `` I make it very clear , in the very first chapter , I establish that the issues about family and marriage are economic issues . 
We have a 300 billion dollar a year dad deficit in this country . 
That 's the cost that the taxpayers for dads who disappear and let the government pick up the tabs for their kids . 
We have an issue also where two thirds of the children of this country who live in poverty would n't live in poverty if their mothers were married to the fathers of those kids . 
So when people say , ' I do n't want to talk about social issues ' - and let me be very clear , I love Mitch Daniels . 
I think he would be a great presidential candidate , I think he would be a good president , but I 'm not arguing with Mitch Daniels . 
I 'm making the case that you can not say these are peripheral issues if you really are concerned about the economy because there is an economic consequence of a broken family . '' 
On overturning Roe v. Wade : `` I think it 's a bully pulpit and it goes beyond just Roe versus Wade . 
See , all that did was say that the states no longer could make the decision , the federal government would . 
If you turned it back to the states , some states would have more liberal abortion than they have now . 
It would n't necessarily fix anything and then you have this geographical morality which I find absurd . 
That is the logic of the civil war , that you can have some states where slavery is okay and others where it is n't . 
That does n't make sense . 
If it 's right then everybody ought to abide by it . 
If it 's wrong , them everyone ought to change . 
So the question is , is it right for one human being to take the life of another human being because it represents a financial burden or a social disruption ? 
Now that 's an argument we can have but once we 've had it , we have to decide that either it is okay or is n't okay . 
I say it 's not okay . '' 
`` I think the president stepped off into a deep hole when he decided arbitrarily and I think illegally that his attorney general and his justice department will not even defend the law of the land which is the Defense of Marriage Act . 
I think I 've spent a page , maybe a page and a half of that entire book dealing with this issue . 
It 'll probably get a lot of controversy . 
I invite people to read it for themselves . 
Read it and if they think that I 'm off-base , fine -- then they can sell it at a used book store . 
`` Government should legislate affirmation of what marriage is . 
Marriage is not whatever we want it to be . 
Marriage is a man and a woman committed in a relationship for life , that 's all it 's ever been . 
Thirty-three states have had this on the ballot . 
Thirty-three , including very liberal states like Maine and California , and in every one of those states , no exceptions , none , those states have affirmed marriage to mean what it has traditionally meant . 
On Mitt Romney 's imposition of a universal health care plan in Massachusetts when he was governor : `` I think the objective analysis of the Massachusetts plan has been that it is done exactly opposite of what it was supposed to do . 
It was supposed to lower costs , it raised costs . 
Supposed to create access , people now have a hard time getting into the doctor . 
It was supposed to open up broader levels of coverage , now people are having to cut back coverage because they ca n't afford everything that they put out there on the plate I do n't think this is a political killer for Governor Romney , but I think he has to come out and say , ` States are supposed to take bold actions . ' '' 
I mention in the book the quote by Louis Brandeis , Supreme Court justice back in 1932 , who talked about states as a laboratory so that you test it in a state , not the whole country . 
If it works you do it , if it does n't work you do n't inflict it upon the other fifty states . ''

Where are our aircraft carriers ? 
No where to be seen .

Obama has shown the world just how weak kneed he is . 
And hundreds , maybe thousands , will die because of it . 
February 24 , 2011 03:18 pm at 3:18 pm | Keep your nose out of Libya 's business . 
You may be or have some authority here , but last I checked it 's somewhat diminished by the fact that you are not now holding office . 
Keep your opinions to yourself , and please allow the Libyan people the respect they deserve by letting them fix their country the way they want to . 
February 24 , 2011 03:32 pm at 3:32 pm | Obama is clueless on how to handle foreign affairs . 
Or did you forget he picked Biden as his foreign policy expert ? 
Yeah , what a disaster and other countries know it . 
February 24 , 2011 03:34 pm at 3:34 pm | The no fly zone is not entirely up to Obama and Huck is right he is not privy to the information needed to pass an opinion . 
He should share that with Republican leader Palin . 
The efforts in Libya are not just that of the US and people have to realize there is a lot at stake here and a no fly zone is a gamble that could go horribly wrong . 
Obama was excellent on this issue by making sure that he did not cock off towards Gadhafi before the Americans in Libya were secured . 
Gadhafi could potentially blow up the oilfeilds and kill thousands of innocent people and this has to be handled properly just like Obama is doing . 
Good for Huck in keeping the right tone here February 24 , 2011 03:35 pm at 3:35 pm | Yes , I see it now . 
Huckabee would be a good president for Libya . 
And I 'm sure ` DemoCommunists for a Better Way -- Bankruptcy ' will vote for him too . 
If there are two people who deserve to be in Libya , it is those two , becasue they have clearly given up on being in any western country that embraces the Enlightenment . 
February 24 , 2011 03:56 pm at 3:56 pm | Does the man understand the term civil war ? 
It is not our job to go into ither countries and do anything ! 
This is not gencide , this is civil unrest . 
It 's mind boggling to think Republicans of which he is one , will oppose healthcare for our citizens on the basis of states rights , yet expect the President to step into Lybia 's problems . 
And what of the 5000 please US troops our goverment has allowe dto die for no reason - we should not have invaded Iraq , yet he does n't condemn us for sending our men and women over ther . 
Sound hypocritcal to me February 24 , 2011 03:59 pm at 3:59 pm | Why was a question directed to Huckabee regarding the Republicans efforts to union busting ? 
He seems to have an answer for ever thing . 
President Obama is doing just fine . 
The previous administration left this country in the ditch and it is going to take years to get this ship right . 
We have two wars that we are currently engaged in that is a big drain our economy and the damage that banks did to us with the toxic loans is more than enough . 
All of this corruption and no one is being prosecuted because of what ? 
We also have the Kouch brothers that are influencing the Republicans to bust the unions to put more money in their pockets . 
So IMO the President is doing just fine . 
February 24 , 2011 04:06 pm at 4:06 pm | Frankly , I do n't mind Huckabee as a person , seems likable though I completely disagree with his beliefs . 
Way too religious for office .

2011-02-24,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libya 's old national flag flutters in front of a bridge during an anti-Gadhafi protest in the eastern Libyan town of Derna . 
Libya has denounced al Qaeda in the past Documents show that more Libyans than citizens in other Arab nations join al Qaeda -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al Qaeda 's North African wing has said `` it will do whatever we can to help '' the uprising in Libya , according to a statement the militant group posted on jihadist websites The statement by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb was posted Thursday , said SITE , a terrorist-tracking organization based outside Washington . 
In the statement , the group said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's decision to hire mercenaries and use planes to fire on protesters invalidates claims that the group is killing innocent civilians . 
Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb started as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat with aspirations to overthrow the Algerian government . 
Around 2004 , it joined forces with al Qaeda and extended its reach across North and West Africa . 
To stop the militant group 's growing influence in Libya , the country has in the past denounced al Qaeda and formed an alliance with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , which once was aligned with al Qaeda before it formally ended a nearly two-decades armed struggle against Gadhafi 's regime . 
In 2006 , al Qaeda documents found by U.S. forces in Iraq showed that per capita , Libya surpassed other Arab nations in the number of citizens joining al Qaeda . 
The regime 's fear was that the terror group would bring its fight back to Libya .

2011-02-24,"Analysis : Gaddafi still has enough loyal forces for a fight LONDON | Thu Feb 24 , 2011 11:50 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi may have lost control of much of his country and military , but a hard core of troops will probably stay loyal as he tries to retain control of western Libya , the coastal strip and the capital Tripoli . 
Much of the oil-rich east around Benghazi appears lost . 
Troops melted away in the face of popular protests inspired by the overthrow of rulers in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia , leaving it in the hands of people 's militias and tribal groups . 
But so far Gaddafi 's opponents appear disparate and disorganized , with no centralized command and little prospect of mounting their own offensives . 
That could leave the initiative in Gaddafi 's hands . 
Analysts say he has always kept the wider military weak and disorganized , leaving real power in the hands of ultra-dedicated units often linked to his own tribal group . 
`` It 's always been kept deliberately nebulous , '' said Alia Brahimi , head of the North Africa program at the London School of Economics . 
`` But I think it 's clear there are at least several thousand troops -- perhaps more -- who will remain loyal to Gaddafi and it 's reasonable to assume that any serious military equipment is likely to be in their hands . '' 
Gaddafi has fomented confusion and rifts in any structure capable of posing a threat , said Jon Marks , a Libya expert and director of the Cross Border Information consultancy . 
`` It 's been divide and rule with the tribes , with political groups , with the regions , and above all with security , '' he said . 
Gaddafi may also be relying on foreign fighters brought in from elsewhere in Africa . 
In Benghazi , local people told Reuters they had captured several and were holding them in prison . 
The Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights , citing reports from Libya exile groups , estimated there were up to 6,000 mercenaries , 3,000 in Tripoli and the rest across the country . 
Others suggest those numbers may be vastly exaggerated . 
There is little solid information on Gaddafi 's weaponry and equipment , dented by years of sanctions . 
`` It is mainly vintage 1950s , 60s and 70s kit , '' IHS Jane 's Middle East analyst David Hartwell said . 
`` Some tanks and armored personnel carriers and artillery . 
Basic stuff , but certainly lethal . '' 
The opposition may also have some tanks and heavy weapons from units that defected , he said , but less in the way of spares and ammunition , less idea how to use it and currently no command and control structure . 
That may change if defecting military commanders and tribal chiefs form new alliances . 
Some experts say army chief General Abu Bakr Younus Jaber , a comrade of Gaddafi in the 1969 coup that brought him to power , is believed to have sided with the rebels . 
Mansour El-Kikhia , an expert on Libyan politics , estimated Gaddafi can call on 10,000-12 ,000 Libyan troops , split broadly between a 32nd Brigade led by his son Khamees , and a presidential guard that has been led by another son , Muatassim . 
There are also armed members of his revolutionary committees , hardline political structures that enforce internal security and which are likely to stay loyal , if only from a sense of self-preservation . 
`` Since the 1970s he has drummed into them that their fate is tied to his , '' Kikhia said . 
`` For the past 40 years he has delegated the carrying out of many of the atrocities of the regime to these forces , deliberately to implicate them . 
He has made sure they understood that they live or die with him . '' 
Information from Libya remains sketchy at best , but the battle lines are slowly emerging of what increasingly looks like a Libyan civil war . 
Gaddafi appears largely in control of Tripoli , after crushing protests there , while his opponents , though disorganised , have ousted him from the second city of Benghazi . 
The situation along the coastal strip between the two cities is more confused . 
Gaddafi 's home town Sirte lies in the middle , apparently under government control . 
Fighting was reported in the port city of Misrata , 200 km east of Tripoli . 
In other coastal towns , military forces have apparently been deployed to quell protesters . 
Gaddafi seems to be trying to cement his control of western Libya , but analysts warned he was still far from safe in Tripoli where popular protests remain a potential threat . 
Analysts said the air force is the only way he can hit back at opposition targets around Benghazi -- potentially including valuable oil installations . 
That could be complicated by the arrival of a British frigate to evacuate foreign nationals . 
On paper , his air force includes dozens of aircraft , mainly Russian-built jets with some 25 French-made Mirages at the start of the week . 
But many are believed to be out of service and Libyan pilots have proved reluctant to strike opposition areas . 
Two Mirage pilots defected to Malta earlier in the week and a Libyan newspaper said the crew of a third aircraft bailed out rather than bomb Benghazi . 
Gaddafi is said to have hired foreign mercenary pilots in the past , but finding new crews may be hard . 
Any war will likely be low-tech and bloody , analysts say . 
The good news is that Libya is believed to have given up and destroyed all stockpiles of chemical weapons as part of its rapprochement with the West . 
Gaddafi must know that if he did use any such weapons against civilian targets , he would invite an overwhelming response from abroad . 
Unlike the World War Two tank battles in the north African desert , fighting in the current conflict is expected to take place in the towns . 
`` This will be urban , '' said one ex-military security expert now advising the oil sector . 
`` Just like Iraq . '' 
A lengthy Iraq-style conflict or descent into Somalia-style anarchy could provide fertile ground for Islamist radicals at a time of great change in Libya 's coastal neighbors . 
`` The consequences could be very bleak , '' said LSE 's Brahimi . 
`` But right now there does n't seem to be any appetite in the outside world to do anything to stop it . ''

2011-02-24,"Analysis : Revolt in Libya likely to scar its oil sector NEW YORK | Thu Feb 24 , 2011 10:24 am EST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Regardless of what comes next in Libya 's lethal political standoff , the OPEC country 's oil sector is nearly certain to suffer , bringing long-lasting supply disruptions or even permanent damage . 
None of several potential outcomes is benign for Libya 's oil industry -- the lifeblood of its economy -- or for oil prices . 
The scenarios run the gamut from all-out civil war and attacks on energy infrastructure to low-level neglect and reservoir damage , as foreign expertise flees the country . 
Over decades , from Iran , to Iraq and Venezuela , periods of political chaos in OPEC countries have usually carved lasting scars on the oil sector , and few expect Libya to be any different . 
`` A period of chaos will probably interrupt Libya 's refining and oil operations , '' said Amy Jaffe , an energy studies fellow and Middle East expert at Rice University in Houston . 
`` The military is abandoning Gaddafi , so it 's unclear who is left to protect oil installations . 
Lots of foreigners are being evacuated , so who will remain in place capable of operating Libya 's oil industry ? 
Will workers even show up ? '' 
As Africa 's No. 3 producer and the site of the continent 's largest proved reserves , estimated at 44 billion barrels , Libyan oil usually accounts for 2 percent of world output . 
The country , whose oil accounts for a fourth of Italy 's demand , is the first major oil exporter to be thrust into acute turmoil since protests began sweeping through the Middle East in January , unseating presidents in Tunisia and Egypt so far . 
An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd of production has been halted , as companies evacuate staff and suspend operations , according to the latest Reuters calculations . 
Much of the country 's oil industry is run by foreign firms including Eni and Repsol , while Libya 's National Oil Corporation -LRB- NOC -RRB- has traditionally been tightly controlled by Gaddafi . 
Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi defiantly pledged on Tuesday to stay in power at any cost , threatening to have protesters hunted down and killed `` house by house . '' 
With rival factions already laying claim to an oil-rich swath of eastern Libya , separated by hundreds of miles of desert from capital Tripoli in the west , the country could even face civil war , analysts warned . 
In OPEC countries where oil infrastructure is the ultimate key to power and purse strings , war and other major political crises have typically resulted in supply disruptions that take years or decades to bounce back from . 
Iran 's 1979 revolution cut the country 's output by more than half , and production never recovered fully . 
Iraq 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait ultimately slashed output in both countries for years , and ravaged Kuwaiti oil wells . 
Venezuela 's massive oil industry strike of 2002 crippled production , which has never returned to pre-strike levels . 
To be sure , OPEC 's top producer Saudi Arabia has stepped in to boost production in previous disruptions in other member producers , and the Saudi oil minister said on Tuesday the cartel , led by the kingdom , stands ready to pump more oil , but only when needed . 
U.S. officials say Saudi Arabia could replace Libyan supplies within a month , although it would leave less available spare capacity . 
Libya 's unrest has helped push Brent crude oil prices up nearly 6 percent since Friday , touching a 2-1\/2 - year high of nearly $ 109 a barrel , although the surge also reflects the chance that chaos will affect other oil-exporting countries . 
Brent rose $ 2.64 to $ 108.42 a barrel on Wednesday . 
`` The output of -LRB- Libya 's -RRB- oil will probably not be completely halted , but it is difficult to see this level of chaos failing to result in significant operational disruptions , '' Eurasia Group analysts said in a note on Tuesday . 
`` It is likely that the country will experience a prolonged period of violent instability , with a potential for full blown civil war . '' 
As the revolt aimed at ending Gaddafi 's 41-year rule intensifies , oil infrastructure could enter the power play . 
Unlike in major African exporters Nigeria and Angola where oil is mostly offshore , installations are mostly on land in Libya , making them potentially more vulnerable . 
`` This effectively gives the country two political factions , two energy-producing basins , two oil output infrastructures . 
Economically at least , the seeds of protracted conflict -- regardless of what happens with Gaddafi or any political changes after he departs - have already been sown , '' said political risk consultancy Stratfor . 
With oil companies scrambling to pull personnel from the country , Libya 's oil industry `` will have to operate under difficult circumstances . 
A sustained lack of security will keep foreign oil companies at bay for a while , '' said energy consultancy PFC in a note . 
As yet , there are no reports of attacks on energy infrastructure , but eastern tribal leaders have threatened to shut off exports , revenue from which usually flows to capital Tripoli , Gaddafi 's increasingly tenuous stronghold in the west . 
Nearby , an underwater gas line to Italy has already been interrupted . 
The fact that Libya is cutting exports of refined products may indicate workers are already abandoning the country 's refineries and their highly explosive plants out of fear . 
A Time Magazine intelligence columnist wrote on Tuesday that Gaddafi himself may be ordering sabotage attacks on oil pipelines leading to the Mediterranean Sea , citing a source in the region . 
At Libyan oil wells , which are mostly in remote desert areas , any abrupt halt could permanently damage infrastructure and compromise it for years . 
`` Anybody who feels they could still control the infrastructure in the future will probably not try to blow it up , '' said Jaffe . 
`` But companies , including the Libyan national oil company , may face a tough decision . 
Will they try for orderly shutdowns that ensure production can resume easily later , or keep fields going but risk events that could damage them ? ''

2011-02-25,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : Reports of 17 dead , 150 wounded in coastal city of Zawiya , near Tunisia Switzerland freezes Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's assets Gadhafi accuses followers of Osama bin Laden of brainwashing youth of Zawiya Portions of eastern Libya are under the control of the opposition Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Doctors at a field hospital in Martyrs Square in Zawiya said Friday that 17 people were killed and another 150 were wounded when government forces attacked the city . 
They predicted the death toll would rise by morning . 
Six pro-regime soldiers who were captured said they had been told that the city was being run by Arab militants and it was their job to liberate it , according to the doctors , who asked not to be identified . 
The soldiers added that they had been misled so that they would fight against their countrymen , the doctors said . 
By the end of the day , the situation was calm in the seaside city , they said . 
The casualties were announced shortly after Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi accused followers of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden of brainwashing the youth of Zawiya with hallucinogenic drugs , resulting in the unrest . 
`` They put it with milk or with other drinks , spiked drinks , '' he said . 
After taking the tablets , `` they attack this police station or that one so they can steal from there the criminal records . '' 
Why are people flocking to Malta ? 
CNN crew greeted as ` liberating heroes ' He pleaded with the protesters ' mothers to track them down in the streets of the coastal town about 55 kilometers -LRB- about 35 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and take them home . 
He added that he had ordered an end to the violence there , but his order upset his security forces . 
`` They told me they are being shot at and they were doing it in self-defense , '' Gadhafi said . 
`` Why do you give us orders to stop ? '' 
Addressing the people of Zawiya , he sent condolences to the families of the dead and wounded . 
`` These are our children , '' he said . 
`` We are quite upset about the senseless loss of lives . '' 
Zawiya 's residents are free to do as they like , though there will be consequences , he said . 
`` If you want to pit against one another , then it 's up to you , '' he said . 
`` But the borders of the city will be sealed in order to stop it from spreading elsewhere . '' 
He added , `` How can such lunatic youth cause such anarchy ? '' 
Gadhafi said Libya has peaceful ways for its citizens to address their grievances . 
`` We are not like Egypt or Tunisia , '' he said , referring to two countries that have ousted their leaders in recent weeks . 
`` Here , the authority is in the hands of the people . 
You can change your authority , just make committees . 
And if you think they are corrupt , take them to court . 
In an apparent allusion to calls for government officials to be held accountable for violence against Libyan civilians , Gadhafi said it is bin Laden who should be prosecuted . 
`` He 's responsible for any acts of murder or sabotage , '' Gadhafi said . 
He accused foreigners of fomenting the discontent . 
`` These acts can not happen by Libyan men , '' he said . 
`` No Libyan of any background would go into this , join these acts of sabotage . '' 
Some of the people involved in the opposition , he said , were detained by the United States in Guantanamo . 
Finally , he expressed confidence that all will end up will for his regime . 
`` I believe Zawiya will toe the line , '' he said , then directed his final comment to the city 's residents themselves . 
`` Please live up to my expectations , people of Zawiya . '' 
A resident of Tripoli who said she was too afraid to give her name for fear of retribution , called Kadhafi 's speech `` crazy . '' 
`` We 're all in our houses like we 're sitting in jail , '' she said . 
`` We ca n't go outside or we get shot . 
We hear the bullets . '' 
She called for other nations to impose a no-fly zone so that Kadhafi would not be able to fly in mercenaries . 
Violence occurred elsewhere too Thursday . 
A formerly pro-government newspaper in Libya reported Thursday that African mercenaries were shooting at unarmed civilians in Tajura , about 25 miles east of Tripoli . 
CNN could not confirm the report . 
Ten days into protests that have resulted in his loss of control of eastern Libya and led members of his government to defect , Gadhafi faced new international pressure Thursday . 
Switzerland ordered that his assets , and those of his entourage , be frozen , the Swiss Foreign Ministry said . 
Gadhafi 's characteristically rambling remarks followed reports that anti-government forces had gained control of Zawiya . 
At the hospital , a woman who said her son had been shot told CNN , `` Blood is all over the streets . '' 
We ca n't go outside or we get shot . 
We hear the bullets . 
The woman said unarmed people had been fired on indiscriminately . 
`` We want to call all human beings : Zawiya is finished , '' she said . 
`` The people -LRB- are -RRB- finished . 
The people -LRB- are -RRB- dying . '' 
She said it was unclear who was behind were shooting . 
Many seemed to be African mercenaries , but they may have been from the government or military , she said . 
`` People are crying , '' she said , calling for help from the world . 
`` Where -LRB- are -RRB- the people ? 
Where is the peace ? '' 
The hospital in Zawiya is `` a disaster , '' she said , adding that some shooters had entered the hospital and insisted that no one was killed . 
CNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya . 
The Libyan government maintains tight control of communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . 
CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . 
Misrata -- sometimes spelled Misurata -- is in the hands of the opposition , who have driven out the mercenaries , witnesses and media reports said . 
It is the country 's third-largest city and is east of Tripoli . 
Witnesses and reports also said the town of Az Zintan was under opposition control . 
The opposition already controls Libya 's second-largest city , Benghazi , where crowds cheered as international journalists drove through . 
The only shooting that could be heard was celebratory gunfire . 
Men in their 20s were guarding the city with shotguns , clubs or hunting knives . 
But Tripoli was a different story . 
Gunfire erupted at dawn Thursday as chanting crowds dispersed . 
Government security forces were tightening their grip on the capital , according to sources . 
In one neighborhood , no one was allowed in or out . 
`` There 's nobody walking in the street , nobody is trying to get out , even to look through the window , '' said a resident who , for security reasons , did not want to be identified . 
`` It 's a little scary . '' 
She said she was risking her life by talking to a reporter . 
`` I 've been trying to keep my identity hidden , '' the woman said . 
`` There are reported kidnappings happening in homes for anybody credible that is talking to the media and giving them the truth about what 's happening in Libya . '' 
Continuing a stream of defections among Libyan diplomats , the ambassador to Jordan , Mohammed Hassan Al Barghathi , said Thursday he was resigning because of the unrest . 
So , too , did a cousin of Gadhafi , Ahmed Gadhaf al-Dam , a top security official who was considered one of Gadhafi 's closest aides . 
In a news release , his office said he left Libya last week `` in protest of the way the crisis was handled '' and that he had resigned . 
Underscoring the growing distance between the Gadhafi regime and Libyan diplomats , the flag hanging outside the Libyan Mission to the United Nations in New York was the opposition flag ; the regime 's flag had been taken down . 
But an anchor on state television said that Libyan diplomats and staff in Saudi Arabia had sent a cable of support `` paying their respective loyalty to the leader of Libya . '' 
The U.N. Security Council will meet privately at 3 p.m. Friday to discuss taking additional measures against Libya . 
The U.N. Human Rights Council also plans to meet Friday to discuss a resolution that would suspend Libya from the council . 
The resolution would condemn `` the massive and unacceptable violence currently being perpetrated in this country , '' French Foreign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said Thursday in a statement . 
`` It holds the Libyan authorities accountable . 
This violence could constitute crimes against humanity . '' 
Governments around the world scrambled to get their citizens out of the country . 
A ferry chartered by the United States to evacuate U.S. citizens remained in port in Tripoli because of bad weather , diplomatic sources said . 
Dena Drotar said her mother , who was on the ship , told her that her fellow passengers were being fed , but were anxious and having difficulty sleeping , `` so they 're also getting a little bit giddy . '' 
In Washington , a senior U.S. military official said the Pentagon was looking at `` all options '' it can offer President Barack Obama in dealing with the crisis . 
`` Our job is to give options from the military side , and that is what we are thinking about now , '' said the official , who declined to be identified because of the extremely sensitive nature of the situation . 
`` We will provide the president with options should he need them . '' 
Obama called French President Nicolas Sarkozy to discuss the situation , and both presidents `` reiterated their demand for an immediate halt to the use of force against the civilian population , '' the French Embassy said . 
CNN 's Richard Roth , Saad Abedine , Waffa Munayyer , Pam Benson , Ben Brumfield , Amir Ahmed , Ingrid Formanek , Eve Bower , Salma Abdelaziz , Mitra Mobasherat and Jaime FlorCruz contributed to this report .

2011-02-25,"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi 's embattled regime ca n't survive , and the United States should call on him to resign , says analyst Fareed Zakaria . 
In the wake of an uprising that has put anti-Gadhafi forces in control of Benghazi and other Libyan territory , President Barack Obama spoke Thursday with the heads of other Western countries on a coordinated response to the crisis , according to the White House . 
The president has condemned the violence in Libya , and the United States is seeking to evacuate its citizens . 
American officials have said sanctions and a no-fly zone were among options being discussed to try to stop the Libyan government from attacking protesters . 
Zakaria said in an interview that he does n't believe sanctions would work . 
`` The one thing that would make a difference is if the president of the United States called for his ouster , '' Zakaria said . 
`` And it would make a difference mostly to the opposition , to the anti-Gadhafi forces , and I think they would be tremendously emboldened . '' 
The author and host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' spoke to CNN on Thursday . 
Here is an edited transcript : CNN : Where are events headed in Libya ? 
Zakaria : I think Gadhafi ca n't last . 
The unusual thing about Libya is that it 's a very large country with a very small population , but the population is actually concentrated very narrowly along the coast . 
So when you hear these stories about cities on the coast being moved over to the anti-Gadhafi forces , this is increasingly most of the country . 
I think Gadhafi is holed up in Tripoli asking to be treated like a constitutional monarch , so it feels as though these are the last days . 
Unless he really surrenders , it could be bloody but I think the end is preordained . 
CNN : Why do you think the Libyan military wo n't rally to his side ? 
Zakaria : That 's the real question , but I think the military wo n't rally to his side because they see the writing on the wall . 
They see that the only way to keep this regime in power would be a wholesale massacre of thousands or tens of thousands of Libyans . 
I ca n't believe they would do that or that ultimately the world would let it happen . 
At some point there is going to be a crack in the regime , at some point some general or the head of the intelligence service is going to turn and at that point , when the regime cracks , I think then it crumbles . 
CNN : What opportunities and difficulties does this present for the United States ? 
Zakaria : Well I 'm a bit puzzled by the Obama administration 's somewhat cautious approach here . 
I supported the way in which they handled Egypt and Bahrain . 
I think in both cases , they had longstanding allies that they had very good relations with . 
They were trying to make sure there was some stability and continuity . 
The Egyptians had been very good on most foreign policy issues the United States cared about , from fighting al Qaeda to making peace with Israel . 
In Bahrain , you had not only an important American ally but also a country that hosts a very important naval base and also a somewhat reformist policy . 
Gadhafi , for all his comical aspects , has been one of the most thuggish , brutal , repressive dictators in the world . 
But here you have an anti-American rogue state , the principal state sponsor of terrorism for decades , that was under sanctions and international isolation for years and with a dictator who ruled his people in the most brutal manner possible . 
Gadhafi , for all his comical aspects , has been one of the most thuggish , brutal , repressive dictators in the world . 
I do n't see why the administration ca n't push harder and be more forceful in its policy on Libya . 
CNN : The suggestion has been made that the reason is a fear that Americans trying to leave Libya would be taken hostage . 
Zakaria : If that 's the case perhaps it 's valid , but the truth of the matter is that they took a stronger line against Mubarak than they have taken against Gadhafi . 
They made clear they thought there needed to be a regime change in Egypt , there needed to be a political transition , a fundamental change , whereas in Libya all they have asked for is an end to the violence . 
If the president of the United States were to get to the podium and say we believe that the regime in Libya needs to change , that Gadhafi needs to resign , that would be a very important moral signal , and would , I think , give a huge boost to the anti-Gadhafi forces . 
All this talk about sanctions and international coordination is meaningless . 
Libya has been under sanctions most of the last 35 years . 
This is a regime that could n't care less about that . 
They get their money from oil revenues , they do n't trade much with the world . 
This is where Libya is different than Egypt and Tunisia . 
Zakaria : Both of them had active trading relations with the rest of the world , particularly Europe . 
In Egypt 's case , they are heavily dependent on tourism , so they cared about the international community . 
I do n't think Gadhafi does at all , he 's never seemed to care in the past when he was not even threatened . 
I do n't think he does now . 
CNN : In recent years , the west has agreed to improved relations with Libya in return for concessions by Gadhafi . 
How does that look in the light of the latest developments ? 
Zakaria : The way Gadhafi has been willing to slaughter his own people highlights what has always been a central feature of his reign which has been a completely callous attitude toward human life -- whether it was sponsoring terrorist attacks against Americans , or sponsoring terrorism in the region . 
CNN : So should the United States and the United Kingdom have reached an accommodation with him years ago -- or should they have been focused on regime change ? 
Zakaria : That 's a tough one . 
Look he was giving up his nuclear program . 
That was a very worthwhile diplomatic effort the United States was engaged in . 
Imagine if Gadhafi had nuclear weapons or even a nuclear program today how much greater the anxieties would be . 
In order to get him to give up his nuclear program , he wanted something in return . 
Now we can have a debate about the precise nature of those negotiations and whether he was given too much , but in general I think it was a good thing that we got him to abandon his nuclear program .

2011-02-25,"The disappearance of their father 20 years ago has haunted brothers Ahmed , left , and Youcif Almegaryaf . 
Izzat Almegaryaf `` disappeared '' more than two decades ago He was an anti-Gadhafi activist imprisoned in Tripoli His sons received a handful of letters smuggled out of jail The three brothers do n't know if their father is still alive Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One afternoon this week , Ahmed Almegaryaf , a college student and part-time DJ in suburban Atlanta made the rounds to a local music joint in his gray Nissan Altima . 
Amid six lanes of traffic on the interstate , it was not difficult to see the oversize sticker plastered on his rear window : `` Where is my father ? '' 
It 's a question that has haunted Ahmed , 26 , and his two brothers all of their lives . 
Their father , a Libyan opposition activist , `` disappeared '' 20 years ago . 
The sons of Izzat Almegaryaf do n't know where he is -- or whether he is still alive . 
All that they know is derived from a handful of letters smuggled out of a Tripoli jail in the mid-1990s . 
For two decades , they 've been left to ponder the grim possibilities of what happens to a man who opposes a dictator as ruthless as Moammar Gadhafi . 
Now , a popular revolt in Libya has presented new hope for the Almegaryaf brothers . 
Gadhafi has vowed rivers of blood to preserve his power . 
But for the first time since he seized Libya 's helm in 1969 , his fate seems uncertain . 
As images and reports from Libya flooded the brothers ' television and computer screens this week , Ahmed , Youcif and Bashir could think of nothing except their father . 
And the possibility that at last , they might find answers to the question that has defined their lives . 
Youcif , 27 , remembers the day his father was taken away , and could hardly watch footage of Gadhafi 's crackdown on protesters . 
This was the man he believes is responsible for destroying his own family . 
How could he simply watch from afar ? 
He said his goodbyes to Ahmed and Bashir , busy studying economics and international relations at Emory University . 
Now 21 , Bashir has chosen to study subjects that were dear to the father he has never known . 
Youcif made his way to the Atlanta airport Tuesday evening to board a flight to Cairo , Egypt , compelled to help in any way he could . 
For now , he plans to shuttle medical aid into eastern Libya . 
The Almegaryaf family believes the Libyan people will prevail . 
They believe Gadhafi is in his last hours , desperation oozing from his words and actions . 
With that prospect , improbable for so long , the three brothers know only this : They are perhaps on the verge of finally knowing many truths about their nation -- and about their father . 
Libyan activist Izzat Almegaryaf , with sons Ahmed , left , and Youcif in the late '80s , was a target of Moammar Gadhafi 's . 
` Daddy , I want to go with you ' On a March evening 20 years ago , a man wearing a traditional Arab disdasha appeared at the apartment in Cairo that the three young Almegaryaf brothers shared with their parents . 
Izzat Almegaryaf had fled Gadhafi 's Libya several years earlier , but he had never surrendered his dreams of freedom . 
The man in the disdasha demanded that Izzat go with him . 
`` Daddy , I want to go with you , '' pleaded Youcif , then only 6 . 
His father did not turn back . 
Plucked from his home and blindfolded , Izzat was put on a jet to Tripoli , the capital of his homeland , and thrown behind bars in one of Gadhafi 's jails . 
No one informed his family of the charges against him . 
No one told them of his whereabouts . 
Gadhafi had called for a `` physical liquidation '' of his political opponents , many of whom were arrested and put to death in public executions , according to Amnesty International . 
Izzat Almegaryaf was one of Gadhafi 's targets . 
On that March evening , a family 's life was shattered . 
A husband , disappeared . 
A wife , Nora , suddenly alone . 
And three little boys left fatherless . 
Youcif and Ahmed , then 5 , yearned to go to the Cairo zoo again with their father so they could feed carrots to the giraffes . 
Or sit and watch their father play cards with his friends , trying to learn how to mimic his every move . 
They missed their father 's embrace . 
Bashir was -- blissfully perhaps -- only five weeks old when Izzat was taken and does not harbor the memories of his older brothers . 
He grew up constantly asking questions about their father : `` What was Baba like ? '' 
Three years later , the family settled in suburban Atlanta under the wing of Mohammed Almegaryaf , the boys ' uncle and once a high-ranking Libyan government official who founded the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya . 
They eked out a new life , becoming citizens of a place far from North Africa , always waiting for the day when Gadhafi would tumble and their father would be released . 
For two agonizing decades , they spent their days longing for one man and hating another . 
Over the years , people told Nora to forget the life she made with Izzat , a handsome former army officer and political activist who loved poetry and music . 
They told her she should remarry , find happiness again . 
Nora refused to abandon her husband . 
She believed in her heart he would return . 
And yet , the boys knew that they could not kid themselves . 
They were dealing with one of the most ruthless regimes in the world . 
They learned snippets of their father 's circumstances through his letters from Abu Salim prison . 
But the last was received in the mid 1990s . 
There has been no direct news of Izzat since then , though reliable witnesses working with human rights groups including Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Council have reported sightings of him up until 1996 , the year Gadhafi squashed an uprising at Abu Salim with brutal force . 
Human Rights Watch says 1,200 prisoners were killed that day . 
It would be one thing to cope with a father 's detention . 
It is another to pass each waking hour not knowing . 
The boys recalled always being asked by strangers : `` Where is your father ? '' 
`` He 's away on a business trip , '' Youcif would reply , knowing the security risks for speaking the truth . 
The family had received anonymous telephone calls threatening them right after Izaat 's abduction . 
Another time , a suspicious phone call came to Youcif 's elementary school in Atlanta from a man who alleged he was Izzat and that the school should have the boy ready to be picked up . 
The family felt they were being watched ; that too many people knew too many things about them . 
That was the nature of Gadhafi 's security apparatus , they said . 
Sometimes , Youcif had nightmares of his father being pulled out of his cell and shot . 
Ahmed developed nonepileptic seizures -- sometimes up to seven an hour -- that his therapist concluded were trauma-induced . 
At first , Nora read out only parts of her husband 's letters that were addressed to the boys . 
She wanted to spare her tender children the harsh truth . 
She knew the letters were genuine -- they were written in her husband 's distinct Arabic calligraphy , often difficult to decipher by those unfamiliar with it . 
He told her he had not been the best husband and father and that it had been due to his `` preoccupation with the Libyan cause . '' 
To his sons , his `` three musketeers , his dear ones , the light of my eyes , '' he wrote : `` You are my dreams for a better future for all of us . 
I can not express to you how much I do miss you , for writing wo n't do it justice . 
You are always on my mind . 
Your greetings reach me with every breath of fresh air I get in the early morning . 
They reach me with the birds , which have made a nest on my pillow . 
Whenever the guards go to sleep , the birds come to me telling me stories about you . 
Your greetings reach me as the wind plays music on the walls of my cell . 
You come to me with the sunrise of every sun and fill my heart with love . 
You come to me at night with every moon . 
You are always with me . '' 
He told them to learn how to be strong , to learn to swim and ride a horse . 
To always be good Muslims . 
And that one day , he knew , they would be reunited in a free Libya . 
`` I taught you that our country does not become greater without us standing up to defend it . 
It only grows with our efforts , sweat and sacrifices , '' he wrote . 
`` When I was with you , I used to worry for your safety , show you endless love , and give you whatever you asked for , you can only imagine how I feel now as I am far away from you . '' 
The boys held on to every word . 
They tried to picture their father sitting in a dark cell . 
Where did he get the paper ? 
What was he wearing ? 
Was he in pain ? 
How was he treating his diabetes ? 
Later , they learned from the letters that their father was detained by a Col. Mohamed Hassan , an Egyptian security agent . 
He had `` disappeared '' along with Jabballah Hamed Matar , another leading Libyan opposition figure in Cairo . 
The two men were taken to the headquarters of the Egyptian military security for further interrogation and then transferred to Abu Salim prison in Tripoli . 
`` Your mother may have told you how I asked the butterflies , the flowers and birds to take care of you , '' he wrote to them . 
`` I asked the wind to gently play with locks of your hair and lessen the difficulties of your life . 
As for the clouds , I have asked them to rain candy on you , and give you shade when it gets hot , and the sky , I asked it to gently rain love and tenderness onto you . 
I wrote for you songs and stories about the homeland and made it into a necklace I placed on you when you were young . '' 
And he asked : `` Do you also think of me ? '' 
A third brother , Bashir Almegaryaf , 21 , protests this month against the Libyan regime in downtown Atlanta . 
One step closer to knowing Youcif , who began working at 16 to help support his family , has in many ways stepped into his father 's shoes . 
Of the three sons , he bears the closest resemblance to Izzat . 
He has been outspoken in denouncing Gadhafi . 
He has taken his family 's cause to the U.N. Human Rights Council and to the British Parliament , where he broke down while speaking about his brother 's seizures . 
He has written to U.S. congressmen and senators . 
Under international law , he tells them , forced disappearances qualify as torture for the victim and his family . 
He can not understand why America wo n't help its own citizens who are being tortured . 
Now , he has committed his strongest act to date , stepping aboard a plane that would carry him physically closer to that place that has fully occupied his heart . 
Before he left , he spoke of the unbridled violence unfolding in his country . 
`` It 's literally a genocide , '' he said . 
`` And we 're doing nothing about it . '' 
He contemplated the possibility that soon , he might set foot on the soil of his ancestors . 
It is a land of pristine beaches and majestic mountains , of people and traditions hidden from the world under Gadhafi 's black curtain . 
His father , like thousands of educated Libyans , knew his country was doomed when early in his rule , Gadhafi scrapped Libya 's constitution and implemented revolutionary law . 
`` I think the devils work for him , '' chimed in Youcif 's brother Ahmed , who has been compiling as much information as he can about the uprising and disseminating it on Twitter , YouTube and Facebook . 
`` It 's hard to explain how ruthless he is , '' Ahmed said . 
`` It 's frustrating to see what he 's done and for the world to shrug it off . '' 
Sometimes , he allows himself images in his head of his first meeting with his father . 
More than anything , he just wants to look at him , feel him . 
He wonders whether his father will be able to recognize his little boy . 
But the images from Libya on television quickly remind him of Gadhafi 's police state . 
And Ahmed returns to reality . 
`` What if he did pass ? '' 
What if , after all this time , the family is shattered all over again ?

2011-02-25,"Libya : An opportunity for al Qaeda ? 
By Paul Cruickshank , CNN Terrorism Analyst A border guard in an empty customs hall on the Libya-Egyptian border . 
Fears are easing that al Qaeda will fill the void in Libya . 
Cruickshank : Militant Islamists have played almost no role in the uprisings in the Arab world Cruickshank : For most Arabs , al Qaeda appears more irrelevant than ever But spiraling violence in Libya may provide future opportunities for militants -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's beleaguered leader Moammar Gadhafi Thursday blamed the uprising sweeping Libya on Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda , accusing the terrorist group of supplying Libyans with pills inducing them to revolt . 
`` Our children have been manipulated by al Qaeda , '' he told Libyan state television by telephone . 
Some may view this as Gadhafi 's greatest delusion yet . 
Militant Islamists have played almost no role in the uprisings in Libya or anywhere else in the Arab world , and for most Arabs , energized by a powerful democracy movement , al Qaeda now appears more irrelevant than ever . 
But there is nevertheless a danger that spiraling violence in Libya may provide militant Islamist groups future opportunities in the country . 
Radicalization has run higher in Libya in recent years than many other Arab countries , especially in Libya 's impoverished , restive eastern provinces , whose tribes have long felt discriminated by Tripoli . 
At the peak of the Iraqi insurgency , more Libyans per capita traveled to join al Qaeda in Iraq than any other country . 
Anger over the Iraq war contributed to the radicalization of a generation of young Libyans . 
Some are concerned that the increasingly chaotic scenes in Libya are the beginning of a videotape that has been played before . 
Moammar Ghadafi talks Osama bin Laden In Iraq , chaotic conditions after the fall of Saddam Hussein gave foreign Islamist terrorists led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi an opportunity to build up operations in the country . 
The ensuing sectarian civil war , which they helped provoke , radicalized the local population , and provided al Qaeda with greatly expanded recruiting opportunities among Iraq 's Sunni community . 
More than 100,000 Iraqis died before the insurgency was contained , more than 10,000 of whom were killed by al Qaeda suicide bombers . 
In Algeria , a 1992 army coup following electoral gains by Islamist parties spawned a violent Islamist insurgency which saw the emergence of the GIA , a hard-line Islamist terrorist group founded by veterans of the Afghan anti-Soviet jihad , which had no qualms about massacring civilians . 
More than 100,000 Algerians were killed in the crossfire of civil war before the insurgency waned in the mid-1990s . 
Noman Benotman , a former Libyan jihadist , is under no illusions about the opportunities available to al Qaeda and like-minded groups if there is an extended period of turmoil in Libya . 
`` If there 's chaos , there will be an opportunity for them . 
That 's just alphabetic , '' Benotman , now a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation , a UK counter-extremist think-tank , told CNN . 
Benotman returned to London Monday after a two-week visit to Tripoli , and his warning comes at a deeply uncertain time for Libya . 
A post-dictator era in the North African state was always going to pose more challenges than in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia because of the country 's deeply tribal structures , lack of experience with elections , and only slowly emerging middle class . 
Such conditions were created and compounded by Gadhafi 's deliberate suppression of civil society , his refusal to develop and empower state institutions , and his strategy of divide and rule between a baffling array of competing power centers , including revolutionary committees across the country that were intentionally created to cement his rule . 
All this would have made a post-Gadhafi transition difficult at the best of times . 
But the country is now in deep disarray and , unlike in Egypt and Tunisia , the army may be too weak and divided to step into the breach . 
Difficulties for jihadists in exploiting the unrest According to Benotman , even during a period of sustained unrest , al Qaeda and like-minded groups will not find it easy to seize the opportunity and build up their operations in Libya . 
Benotman points out that there is no established jihadist group left on the scene in Libya to exploit the unrest by recruiting , organizing and directing potential recruits . 
Freedom , political opening , and democracy will reduce the threat of extremists groups in Libya . 
-- Noman Benotman , former Libyan jihadist In 2009 , Benotman 's former group , the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group -LRB- LIFG -RRB- , formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime , and it repudiated al Qaeda . 
In the mid-1990s the LIFG had conducted a deadly campaign of attacks on Libyan security services , before a crackdown largely constrained the group 's ability to operate inside the country . 
The breakthrough was the result of a two-year dialogue launched by Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the son of Libya 's leader , and brokered by Benotman , a former high-ranking figure in the group . 
The agreement also saw the group publish a new code of ethics for jihad , forbidding attacks on civilians and outlawing attacks in the West . 
Senior CNN International Correspondent Nic Robertson and I interviewed leading figures of the LIFG in Abu Salim prison in Tripoli in September 2009 , shortly before the group 's leaders were released . 
Although they were then behind prison bars , their disavowal of violence appeared genuine , and they appear to have stuck to their side of the bargain since . 
Some have argued that with the LIFG sidelined , the best-placed group to take advantage of deteriorating conditions in Libya is al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- , a largely Algerian terrorist group that grew out of the GIA . 
In an indication that it seeks to exploit the situation in Libya , AQIM Thursday released a statement in support of the uprising in Libya , stating that it will do whatever it could to help . 
AQIM may have some opportunities in the medium term to establish itself in Libya . 
In an interview with CNN 's Robertson in September 2009 , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi said a number of Libyans had joined AQIM 's ranks in Algeria and Mali and that the group would `` love to energize young Libyans . '' 
In the near term , however , AQIM is neither well-placed to join in the uprising nor to exploit it . 
The group , now largely based in the Sahel region of Mauritania , Mali and Niger , has very little presence in Libya because of the previously tight grip of Libya 's security services , and has been largely driven out of neighboring Algeria . 
Furthermore , according to Benotman , there has been lingering animosity between the Algerian terrorist group and Libyan jihadists ever since the GIA killed a number of LIFG members in Algeria in the mid-1990s , after the Libyans took issue with the GIA 's super-extremist ideology . 
According to Benotman , the LIFG 's new code of jihadist ethics , widely made available across Libya , will make some young Libyans think twice about joining terrorist groups . 
Al Qaeda has had no role in this uprising , none of the demonstrators are calling for an Islamic state . 
-- Noman Benotman , former Libyan jihadist The reduced relevance of al Qaeda Another factor that will make it difficult for Islamist terrorist groups to exploit the situation in Libya is the reduced relevance of al Qaeda 's message as a pro-democracy movement sweeps across the Middle East . 
`` Al Qaeda has had no role in this uprising , none of the demonstrators are calling for an Islamic state , '' Benotman told CNN . 
Even senior al Qaeda figures now concede this . 
The revolutions sweeping the Arab world were not the `` perfections for which we hoped , '' purportedly wrote Attiya Allah , a leading Libyan al Qaeda ideologue believed to be based in Pakistan . 
Some reports had indicated that Allah died last year . 
The statement posted on the internet Wednesday , and translated by the SITE Institute , was authored on February 16 as protests started gathering force in Libya . 
Expressing rather limited ambition , Allah said he hoped that a post-dictator era would give al Qaeda greater freedom to proselytize in the Middle East . 
Al Qaeda currently has no `` magic wand '' to provide the necessary manpower to overturn governments in the Middle East , added Allah . 
Libyan officials have painted a different picture , but their claims have been difficult to verify . 
Officials , for example , alleged Sunday that a group called the Islamic Emirate of Barqa carried out deadly attacks on military installations in and around Darnah , a town on the Mediterranean coast in eastern Libya , with a population of around 80,000 . 
CNN has not been able to verify the claim The town may emerge as something of a litmus test for the reach of al Qaeda 's influence in Libya . 
If militant extremist groups gains traction anywhere in Libya , they will likely do so first in places like Darnah , where years of neglect by the Gadhafi regime have created some of the bleakest socioeconomic prospects for young men in the Middle East , as well as simmering anger toward Tripoli . 
By most accounts , radicalization has run high in the town in recent years . 
According to al Qaeda administrative records seized by the U.S. Army in Sinjar , Iraq , in 2007 , 52 men from that town -- more than any other city in the Arab world -- traveled to join al Qaeda 's Iraqi affiliate . 
Benotman says extremists may now be losing ground in Darnah . 
He points out that Islamist demands have been absent from television images of the townsmen chanting in celebration of what they believe to be the end of Gadhafi rule . 
If prospects improve in places like Darnah , young men will likely be less attracted to groups like al Qaeda , its blame-all-on-America narrative , and its promise of jihadist adventure , glory , and rewards in the afterlife . 
For young Libyans the sense of excitement of being part of a historic democracy movement sweeping the Middle East may also make the lure of al Qaeda fade . 
These events are creating a powerful narrative and promise of their own . 
`` Freedom , political opening , and democracy will reduce the threat of extremists groups in Libya , '' Benotman told CNN . 
In the battle to shape the future of Libya , much will depend on what happens in the next days and weeks . 
Thus far , eastern Libya -- the most promising recruiting ground for Islamist terrorist groups -- has largely been spared the brutal crackdown taking place in an around Tripoli . 
If forces loyal to Gadhafi were able to retake control of eastern Libya , all bets would be off . 
The bloodletting would undoubtedly play into the hands of al Qaeda and like-minded groups . 
Benotman says Libya 's best hope for avoiding a dangerous slide into chaos may now lie with the Free Officers , the group of young army officers who overthrew Libya 's monarchy and brought Gadhafi to power in 1969 . 
Benotman says many of the Free Officers still have high-ranking positions in the country 's military , and increasing numbers of them have defected from the regime , disturbed by Gadhafi 's brutal crackdown on civilians . 
`` This is a group drawn from all the tribes and regions of Libya , and they would be seen as representing the whole nation , '' Benotman told CNN .

2011-02-25,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : U.S. will reach out to Libya `` where appropriate , '' State Department official says The U.S. government is imposing sanctions against Libya and has suspended embassy operations U.S.-chartered ferry with around 300 people completes trip from Libya to Malta The U.S. Treasury Department advises banks to report unusual Libyan financial transactions The American embassy in Libya suspended operations for security reasons , though State Department officials stressed that diplomatic ties were not suspended and channels for discussion remained open . 
`` The flag is still flying . 
The embassy is not closed . 
Relations are not broken , '' Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy told reporters . 
State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Janet Sanderson reiterated at the same briefing that Libya 's Embassy in Washington is still `` up and running , '' and the department has not been informed of any change in the status of Libya 's ambassador to the United States . 
Americans escape danger in Libya `` We still continue to reach out to the Libyans where appropriate , both directly and through third parties , '' Sanderson said . 
Kennedy said all American official employees were withdrawn from the embassy Friday , and only Libyan employees are `` still on the payroll ' and still working there . 
These remaining employees are not authorized to conduct any U.S. government business , he said . 
Local and national security guards remain at the embassy , Kennedy said , but he would not discuss what measures if any are being taken to secure documents and the like inside the embassy . 
`` But I can assure you that there is nothing left behind that could be compromised , '' he said . 
American operations at the embassy will resume when the security situation permits it , Kennedy said . 
In addition to pushing both unilateral and multilateral sanctions , Washington will use the `` full extent '' of its intelligence capabilities to monitor Gadhafi 's regime and gather evidence of atrocities committed against the Libyan people , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said . 
Steps were also taken to ensure that top Gadhafi officials do n't steal Libyan financial assets in what may be their final days in power . 
The Treasury Department advised banks to monitor accounts held by the regime 's key political figures and to report financial transactions `` that could potentially represent misappropriated or diverted state assets , '' according to a government statement . 
Gadhafi 's `` legitimacy has been reduced to zero in the eyes '' of the Libyan people , Carney told reporters . 
`` The status quo is neither tenable nor acceptable . '' 
The point of U.S. action -- particularly the sanctions -- is to `` make it clear that the regime has to stop its abuses '' and end the bloodshed , Carney said . 
Reports from Libya suggest that possibly hundreds of protesters have been killed . 
Washington also announced the suspension of all military cooperation with Libya , reversing a course of action taken after Gadhafi 's government ended its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction . 
Obama will meet with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Washington on Monday to discuss the full range of diplomatic , legal and other steps that may be taken to bring a halt to the violence , Carney said . 
The new steps against Gadhafi 's government were announced less than an hour after a flight chartered by the U.S. government departed Tripoli for Istanbul . 
The flight carried personnel from the U.S. embassy and other American citizens . 
Earlier , a ferry chartered by U.S. authorities carried roughly 300 people to Malta . 
As U.S. citizens continued to flee the spreading unrest , clashes between Libyan security forces and protesters were reported in Tripoli , which has been a Gadhafi stronghold . 
Eastern Libya appeared to be largely in the hands of anti-government forces . 
Obama spoke Thursday with the leaders of France , Italy and the United Kingdom on coordinating an international response to the crisis in the north African nation . 
In separate phone conversations with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and British Prime Minister David Cameron , Obama `` expressed his deep concern with the Libyan government 's use of violence which violates international norms and every standard of human decency , and discussed appropriate and effective ways for the international community to immediately respond , '' a White House statement noted . 
While some critics say the Obama administration has been slow to react to the deteriorating situation in Libya , the statement said Thursday 's discussions were to `` coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure that there is appropriate accountability . '' 
On Friday , Obama discussed the Libyan crisis with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan . 
Earlier in the week , Obama strongly condemned the use of violence against protesters in Libya and said a unified international response was forming . 
`` The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous , and it is unacceptable , '' he said . 
`` This violence must stop . ''

2011-02-25,"American evacuee is happy but feels torn Yusra Tekbali : We 've spent three days aboard U.S. evacuation ferry She says her family decided to leave after hearing Gadhafi 's threats Passengers describe clashes between protesters and Libyan security forces Editor 's note : Yusra Tekbali , a freelance journalist , filed this piece before a U.S.-chartered ferry evacuating people from Libya left Friday for Malta . 
Born in Woodland , California , to Libyan parents , she graduated from The University of Arizona with degrees in journalism and Near Eastern studies . 
Aboard the U.S. evacuation ship -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I 've been in Tripoli for nearly three months ; the past three days have felt about that long . 
We have been stuck on a boat bound for Malta that could n't leave port because of heavy winds and waves as high as 9 meters . 
As the boat sat in Tripoli Harbor , not far from the Green Square , which just a few days ago was packed with pro-Moammar Gadhafi protesters attempting to drown out the escalating opposition to the regime , images from movies continuously crossed my mind : That scene in `` Titanic '' where everyone scrambles to get off the boat , `` Speed 2 '' and an imagined James Bond flick to be set in Libya . 
That third movie is not even in pre-production , though I call dibs to star as the Bond girl . 
As for Bond , well , he must be tripping on Gadhafi 's speech , because he has yet to show up . 
I have a feeling Libya 's revolution will go on without him , though I did n't hear it from Jamahiriya TV . 
Aboard this ship , many of us continued to follow the People 's Movement , huddling around one computer we took turns sharing , as someone read Twitter feeds and news headlines aloud rather quickly before the internet cut off again . 
Libyan-Americans are the most concerned . 
We keep asking each other if we 've heard any news from friends or family around Tripoli , and where the latest violence took place . 
My family -- including my mom , two of my sisters and my brother -- are on this ferry with 300 other people . 
Before boarding we were cooped up in our house , glued to several news stations -LRB- except Al-Jazeera Arabic which we could n't get -RRB- and wondering if the gunshots we heard overhead would hit us . 
Even then we had no intention of leaving Tripoli . 
We wanted to witness history , and it felt wrong -- especially for my mom -- to leave the rest of our family and other Libyans behind . 
We changed our mind after Gadhafi addressed the country and alarmed the world in his speech on Monday . 
We felt his threats in our bones , and it hit us : This man will massacre and burn the entire city . 
We felt his threats in our bones , and it hit us : This man will massacre and burn the entire city . 
On Tuesday at 5 a.m. my brother was watching CNN , which reported a U.S. Embassy boat would be in Tripoli in a few hours to evacuate American citizens . 
We barely had enough time to pack and make it over to the harbor , only to wait around until 6 p.m. to actually board the boat . 
That 's when we were told it would n't leave because of severe winds . 
Three days on a small boat in the heart of town during a war is not an ideal place to be . 
`` We feel like sitting ducks , '' one passenger said , yet we also feel safer knowing we are protected by U.S. personnel . 
We 've been living off of cold sandwiches , chocolate and potato chips , -LRB- the food available on deck -RRB- and trying to think of options other than just sitting there to pass the time . 
Most people sleep very little , scrunched up in their chairs or lying on the floor , covering themselves with sweaters or sharing blankets . 
We 've all gotten to know each other . 
Libyan-Americans are especially eager to exchange stories about what they 've seen and heard . 
Tareq , from Houston , says he joined the protesters in Gergarish on Sunday and Monday night , the first and second day of the uprising . 
He saw young men burn Gadhafi 's picture and throw rocks and shoes at billboards displaying the number 41 , the number of years he has been in power . 
`` They were throwing rocks at it so hard it sounded like guns , '' he said . 
`` When the police showed up , they fired at us . 
I 'd never heard an automatic rifle up close before . 
It 's really intimidating . '' 
Some of Gadhafi 's thugs posed as anti-government protesters and told men on the street to join them , he said . 
A protester I interviewed earlier confirmed that , saying they were spreading rumors that Gadhafi had left the country . 
A Libyan man from Dubai said he could n't reach his hotel that same night because it was blockaded by military closing in on around 100 anti-regime protesters who set trash cans and photos of Gadhafi on fire . 
He heard machine-gun fire and saw three government land cruisers drive by . 
Two of the three cars were filled with African mercenaries , and the third seemed to be Eastern Europeans , he said . 
All the men carried AK-47s , he said . 
Saleh , a Libyan-American working in Tripoli , took part in the protests at the Green Square . 
He was attacked by Gadhafi 's militia and fled the scene . 
`` I ended up having to hide out in an alleyway all night because I could hear them searching for us , '' he said . 
On the first night the protesters in the Green Square thought they were victorious because they had driven out some of Gadhafi 's thugs . 
Then the military showed up and started attacking protesters , who fled to different areas . 
Saleh and Tareq both confirm reports that help from Benghazi is on the way . 
`` We are united . 
There is a plan , and the people of Libya are not giving up . '' 
An American from Wisconsin overhears our conversation and expresses his support for the protesters , saying Gadhafi 's end is `` imminent . '' 
`` Pardon the metaphor , '' he says , `` but Gadhafi is gonna go down like a sinking ship . '' 
Let 's just hope that 's the only `` ship '' that sinks . 
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yusra Tekbali .

2011-02-25,"U.S. , Saudi reassure on growth as Libya turmoil drives oil WASHINGTON\/RIYADH | Fri Feb 25 , 2011 6:36 pm EST WASHINGTON\/RIYADH -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The world can weather a spike in oil prices , U.S. President Barack Obama said , as Saudi Arabia offered some respite to fears over Middle East oil supplies by indicating it can cover export cuts resulting from Libya 's civil war . 
After a surge in Brent oil prices to 2 - year highs near $ 120 a barrel , South Korea , the world 's fifth-biggest crude importer , warned that its inflation situation was getting tougher . 
Business executives fretted about rising prices and investment banks said oil was reaching an inflection point that could endanger the world 's recovery from the global financial crisis . 
`` We actually think that we 'll be able to ride out the Libya situation and it will stabilize , '' Obama , referring to fuel prices , told a group of corporate chief executives . 
His Treasury Secretary said the world had plenty of oil reserves . 
`` We have substantial capacity across the major economies in the strategic reserves , '' Timothy Geithner said . 
`` Hopefully , by reminding people of that and calling attention to the fact that there 's a fair amount of excess capacity in parts of OPEC ... hopefully that will make it less likely the market ... starts to build in higher prices over time . '' 
The key risk for the world economy is a sustained rise in the price of oil . 
But after shooting up to close to $ 120 a barrel in intraday trade on Thursday , Brent crude futures ended the day at less than $ 112 , showing just how fraught investors nerves are . 
The sharp fall came after market rumors that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had been shot dead and on news that top producer Saudi Arabia could cover any supply disruptions . 
On Friday , Brent crude was trading around $ 112 . 
U.S. crude futures eased to $ 97.60 from a Thursday high of $ 103.41 . 
In Libya , forces loyal to Gaddafi hit back in fierce gun battles with rebels holding towns near the capital but there were no signs they had broken the opposition momentum . 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -LRB- OPEC -RRB- has an estimated 4-6 million barrels per day of spare crude production capacity , more than enough on paper to cover Libya 's output of 1.6 million barrels a day . 
But markets are worried that the unrest might spread to bigger producers in the region that would have a much bigger impact on the world economy . 
After public uprisings have already toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia , governments in the region are taking notice . 
Saudi Arabia this week unveiled a $ 37 billion package to try to insulate the kingdom from the wave of protests across the Arab world , while Algeria lifted a 19-year-old state of emergency as it tried to appease opposition groups . 
`` When you start adding the potential number of barrels at stake , you can see why the market is tense and would rather be long oil than short , '' said Harry Tchilinguirian , chief commodity strategies at BNP in London . 
Deutsche Bank said oil above $ 120 a barrel would be an inflection point for global economic growth . 
At that price , oil as a share of global GDP starts to move above 5.5 percent , historically a point where global growth has come under pressure . 
Airlines are feeling the brunt of high oil prices as reflected in sharp falls in stock prices . 
Chinese flag carrier Air China Ltd has dropped 14 percent this week . 
`` Unfortunately , oil prices have been rising like mad recently , '' said Li Jiaxiang , head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China . 
Emerging Asia , which led the world 's recovery from the global financial crisis , is already trying to deal with escalating food prices . 
Higher oil prices will add to the dilemma for policymakers of how to contain inflation and support economic growth . 
Yet another complication is that while the crude price spikes this week reflect a supply-side risk , oil prices were already rising as economic activity around the world picked up pace . 
`` The global recovery is ongoing , it is gaining more traction but the developments in the crude-oil sector as a result of the turmoil in the Middle East is putting to question the strength of that recovery , '' said Jose Mario Cuyegkeng , economist at ING in Manila . 
Since most countries have little control over the world price of oil , raising interest rates would not address the issue for their economies . 
But higher fuel prices could feed through to other prices , such as transport , and inflation expectations . 
`` The environment influencing inflation is now much more difficult than what we had expected at the end of last year , '' said Yim Jong-yong , South Korea 's vice finance minister . 
Indonesian central bank deputy governor Hartadi A. Sarwono said he expects a recent drop in food and commodity prices to push monthly inflation down in the country , but oil was a risk . 
`` We have to be cautious on long-term inflation from rising oil prices , '' he told reporters . 
The combination of high oil prices undermining growth while fuelling inflation raises the prospect of stagflation that blighted economies in the 1970s . 
Westpac rates strategist Russell Jones said there was a risk of stagflation but there were economic differences now -- including less reliance on oil and better central bank credibility -- to suggest any outbreak would be mild and short lived . 
Still , it would still result in a pick up in the pace of monetary policy tightening , he said . 
`` The longer that oil prices remain elevated , the more likely that the European Central Bank and Bank of England could hike in the second quarter . 
Emerging market central banks are also apt to tighten more aggressively .

2011-02-25,"Gas prices are seen at a petrol station in New York February 22 , 2011 . 
NEW YORK | Fri Feb 25 , 2011 5:08 pm EST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Brent oil rose in volatile trade on Friday to hold above $ 112 a barrel but below Thursday 's 2-1\/2 - year highs after Saudi Arabia raised output to calm fears of supply disruptions sparked by Libya 's uprising . 
Saudi Arabia has boosted output by more than 700,000 barrels per day , to a level exceeding 9 million bpd , a senior industry source familiar with Saudi production told Reuters . 
Worries about the worsening situation in Libya , where oil outages have risen to as much as three quarters of its 1.6 million bpd output , spurred short-covering before the weekend . 
Those moves were further stoked by news that the United States was imposing sanctions and cutting diplomatic ties with Libya as Muammar Gaddafi 's security forces cracked down against a widening revolt against his rule . 
`` I do n't think many traders are comfortable being short over the weekend , '' said Tom Bentz , a broker at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York . 
Estimates of Libya 's supply loss could not be confirmed , however , with conditions unsettled as rebels fought to wrest control of oilfields and terminals in the east of the country from Gaddafi loyalists . 
On Thursday , the disruptions pushed Brent to almost $ 120 and U.S. crude to more than $ 103 . 
Brent shot ahead as more of Libya 's oil exports go to European refiners than to those in the United States . 
In London , Brent futures for April closed up 78 cents at $ 112.14 a barrel , the highest weekly settlement since August 21 , 2008 . 
They peaked at $ 113.91 , below Thursday 's high of $ 119.79 , the loftiest intraday since August 2008 . 
U.S. April crude futures settled up 60 cents at $ 97.88 , the highest weekly close since September 2008 , and reached $ 99.20 earlier . 
That was well below Thursday 's intraday peak of $ 103.41 , also the highest since September 2008 . 
Brent 's premium against U.S. crude rose to $ 14.26 , from $ 14.08 at the close on Thursday , when the Brent spread against U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate rocketed to a record $ 16.91 . 
`` Fears that the unrest in Libya could turn into a civil war and wipe out its oil production have been offset by assurances from Saudi Arabia that it is raising output , '' said Gene McGillian , analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford , Connecticut . 
U.S. crude drew support from a rise in consumer confidence to a three-year high in February , suggesting the economy remained on a solid footing despite high gasoline prices , according to a ThomsonReuters\/University of Michigan survey . 
That optimism was tempered by the latest reading of fourth-quarter 2010 economic growth , which showed the U.S. economy grew more slowly than expected .

2011-02-26,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : Saif al-Islam Gadhafi says his father 's government can survive and reunite Libya Libya 's UN ambassador applauds the unanimous U.N. resolution targeting Gadhafi A Libyan diplomat says `` we support '' an interim government led by a former minister Despite an eerie calm , a Tripoli man says he senses `` something big is going to happen '' -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Saturday night to punish Moammar Gadhafi 's government in Libya for violence against unarmed civilians , hours after the nation 's budding opposition picked a former top official as its interim leader . 
The draft resolution includes an arms embargo , asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and several of his family members and associates . 
It also refers the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court . 
`` This resolution will be a signal -LRB- to -RRB- put an end to the fascist regime that is still in existence , '' said Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham , Libyan ambassador to the United Nations , who urged action Friday in an emotional appeal . 
He 'd earlier renounced support for Gadhafi , calling him Saturday `` a leader who loves nobody but himself . '' 
Military and security forces loyal to Gadhafi have killed more than 1,000 people , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has estimated . 
Meanwhile , Libya 's deputy amassador to the world body , Ibrahim Dabbashi , indicated Saturday that he and fellow diplomats `` support ... in principle '' a caretaker administration to lead Libya under the direction of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil . 
Embassy head : ` We were lucky to get out ' State Dept. ` concerned ' for Libyans City councils in areas no longer loyal to Gadhafi chose Jalil to head an interim government that would represent all of Libya and ultimately be based in Tripoli , according to Amal Bogagies , a member of the coalition of the February 17 Uprising , and a separate Libyan opposition source . 
Both are based in Benghazi . 
Jalil was in Gadhafi 's government through February 21 , when he quit to protest the `` bloody situation '' and `` use of excessive force '' against unarmed protesters , according to Libyan newspaper Quryna . 
Days later , he told a Swedish newspaper he had evidence that Gadhafi ordered the 1988 bombing of a jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people . 
Protests began February 15 in the eastern city of Benghazi , Libya 's second largest . 
It and many others are now thought to be under opposition control , according to eyewitnesses . 
There have been numerous reports of widespread violence , some of it perpetrated by foreign mercenaries and military and security forces loyal to Gadhafi . 
Libya 's foreign minister said earlier Saturday that talks are underway between Gadhafi 's government and figures in the eastern part of the North African nation . 
Benghazi-based opposition spokesman Jalal Igallal , however , strongly knocked down reports of any discussions between anti-government figures and officials supportive of Gadhafi . 
He urged Foreign Minister Musa Kasa to say who is being talked to , if such negotiations are in fact ongoing . 
Early Sunday , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- one of Moammar ' Gadhafi 's sons and a prominent member of his government -- told CNN 's Nic Robertson that he was confident the regime could survive the unrest and ultimately reunite Libya . 
Saif Gadhafi added that he wanted this reunification to be accomplished without violence . 
While CNN does have staff in some cities , the network could not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya . 
But CNN has compiled information through telephone interviews with witnesses . 
Tripoli itself was noticeably tense but largely quiet overnight Saturday , its streets largely barren except for police , armed men in civilian clothing and young people with sticks at some intersections . 
One man , who is not named for safety reasons , described an `` eerie feeling '' around the capital , even as fear of violence drove many people to hunker down in their homes . 
`` You can feel the tension and the anticipation that something big is going to happen , '' he said . 
`` Everyone is waiting for it . '' 
The situation at the main airport , about 20 miles south of Tripoli , was far more chaotic . 
Several thousand people camped outside in makeshift tents , waiting for the chance to leave the war-torn country . 
More than 200 Arab organizations and a group of 30 prominent intellectuals from across the Middle East and North Africa urged global bodies , including the Security Council , the European Union and the African Union , to take action to limit further death and destruction . 
A protester 's view from Libya Libyan : U.S. ` does n't give a damn ' `` We fear we may be witnessing the calm before the storm , '' said their statement . 
`` The window of opportunity to prevent further atrocities from occurring is closing fast . 
The people of Libya need you to act quickly and decisively . '' 
The group urged the international community to devise contingency plans for intervention and impose immediate sanctions on the Libyan regime . 
`` We appeal to you as leaders who have the power to bring an end to this horror , '' the statement said . 
`` Your failure to do so would be a lasting stain on the responsibilities of world leadership and on humanity itself . '' 
U.S. President Barack Obama also weighed in Saturday , telling German Chancellor Angela Merkel to `` coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure appropriate accountability , '' according to a White House statement . 
In some of his strongest wording to date , Obama said , `` when a leader 's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people , he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now . '' 
Later , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement urging Gadhafi to step down . 
`` Moammar Gadhafi has lost the confidence of his people and he should go without further bloodshed and violence , '' Clinton said . 
`` The Libyan people deserve a government that is responsive to their aspirations and that protects their universally recognized human rights . '' 
Tripoli 's Green Square , occupied by pro-Gadhafi demonstrators on previous evenings , was empty Saturday night , a witness told CNN . 
She said her neighborhood near the square was eerily quiet . 
Another man said men carrying automatic weapons had set up checkpoints at `` every major intersection or traffic light , '' while hospitals are heavily guarded by armed security personnel . 
Other frightened residents said they stayed indoors , though unable to shut off the sound of gunfire or put aside the words of Gadhafi in a public address the day before in which he vowed to keep unleashing force . 
`` We can destroy any assault with the people 's will , with the armed people , '' he said on state television Friday . 
`` And when it is necessary , the weapons depots will be open to all the Libyan people to be armed . '' 
Libya 's prime minister , meanwhile , announced on state television that every family would receive 500 Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 406 -RRB- from the government . 
The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said in a statement Saturday one of its teams was in Benghazi . 
Their arrival , and a promise of future aid , marked one of the first humanitarian inroads into Libya in recent weeks . 
Three main hospitals were all `` well equipped and have managed to deal with the numbers of wounded people and medical needs , '' according to the group . 
But the facilities also face shortages of drugs , bandages and other medical items , which Doctors Without Borders said it will provide . 
The group plans to send an orthopedic surgeon , anesthesiologist and nurse on Monday . 
The advocacy group Human Rights Watch said the situation was appreciably worse in Zawiya -- about 55 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and the epicenter of violent protests Thursday . 
`` West of Tripoli in Zawiya city , government security forces firing on demonstrators are causing bloodshed and chaos , '' said Sarah Leah Whitson , the group 's Middle East and North Africa director . 
Operations at several embassies -- including those of Great Britain and the United States -- in Tripoli have been effectively shuttered , for the safety of their personnel . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he planned to speak with Obama in Washington on Monday . 
For now , Libyans themselves are left to wait to see what happens next . 
`` We wait and see what tomorrow will bring , '' a Tripoli man said early Sunday . 
`` We pray for a quick ending to this nightmare , with minimum bloodshed . 
No one is naive , however , to believe that Gadhafi is going to go easily . ''

2011-02-26,"By the CNN Wire Staff Gadhafi offers to increase state salaries and give families money Libyan ambassador : `` It 's not a crime to say ' I want to be free ' '' Ban : `` The violence must stop '' U.S. suspends embassy operations in Tripoli Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As clashes in the Libyan capital continued Friday between government security forces and anti-regime protesters , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters unequivocally : `` The violence must stop . '' 
His remarks came as state television was airing images of the embattled but defiant strongman urging viewers to defend the nation . 
A man CNN will identify only as Reda to protect his identity said in a telephone interview that armed men dressed in plainclothes fatally shot his two brothers Friday as they were demonstrating against the government . 
Also killed were his two neighbors , he said . 
`` The bodies have been kidnapped from the street , '' Reda said . 
`` My other neighbors told me they kidnapped the injured people in the hospital to somewhere , nobody knows -LRB- where -RRB- . 
This is the perfect crime . 
He 's hiding all evidence for every crime he has . 
This is the horrible situation that nobody knows . '' 
State Dept. ` concerned ' for Libyans More than 1,000 people have been killed , according to estimates cited Friday by Ban . 
He noted that the eastern part of the country `` is reported to be under the control of opposition elements , who have taken over arms and ammunition from weapon depots . '' 
At least three cities near Tripoli have been the site of daily clashes , and the streets of the capital are largely deserted because people are afraid of being shot by government forces or militias , he said . 
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's supporters `` are reportedly conducting house-by-house searches and arrests . 
According to some reports , they have even gone into hospitals to kill wounded opponents , '' Ban said . 
Accounts from the news media and human rights groups and witnesses `` raise grave concerns about the nature and scale of the conflict , '' he said . 
He said they include reports of indiscriminate killings , shooting of peaceful demonstrators , torture of the opposition and use of foreign mercenaries . 
The victims have included women and children and `` indiscriminate attacks on foreigners believed to be mercenaries , '' he said , referring to reports . 
Ban called on the international community `` to do everything possible '' to protect civilians at demonstrable risk . 
Ban said there appeared to be a growing crisis of refugees , with some 22,000 people having fled to Tunisia and a reported 15,000 to Egypt in the past few days . 
For many , the trip has been a harrowing one . 
`` There are widespread reports of refugees being harassed and threatened with guns and knives , '' Ban said . 
`` The violence must stop , '' he said . 
`` Those responsible for so brutally shedding the blood of innocents must be punished . 
Fundamental human rights must be respected . '' 
Ban said he will travel Monday to Washington to speak with U.S. President Barack Obama . 
Report : Libyan protesters fired upon Also at the United Nations , Libyan Ambassador Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham told reporters that he hoped Gadhafi and his sons would end the rampage `` against our people '' within hours . 
Asked why he had continued to support Gadhafi until just a few days ago , the diplomat said , `` I could n't imagine in the beginning that it was going to be -LRB- this bad -RRB- . '' 
But he now supports the protesters . 
`` It 's not a crime to say , ' I want to be free , ' '' he said . 
The Libyan ambassador to the United States , Ali Suleiman Aujali , told CNN that he too has joined the opposition . 
`` When I see the mercenaries killing our peoples , and we see our women screaming in the street , and I see there is no distinguishing between who they are target , I ca n't take this , '' said the diplomat , who served the Libyan government 's foreign service for more than 40 years . 
He said his fellow diplomats and many of the country 's police had also turned against Gadhafi in his quest to retain control of Libya . 
`` The problem now is western part , '' he said , speaking in Washington . 
`` Unfortunately , they 've been confronted with mercenaries . '' 
Asked whether he would want to see his former boss dead , he said , `` I want him to be out of my country . 
I want him to be out of the Libyan life . '' 
As he spoke , reports emerged of sniper and artillery fire in Tripoli , said Mohammed Ali Abdallah of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya , which opposes Gadhafi 's regime . 
He based his account on reports that he said he received from witnesses . 
Another witness told CNN that protesters in western Tripoli were met by plainclothes security forces who fired guns at them and later tear gas to disperse the crowds . 
Prior to the clashes on Friday morning , security forces had removed barricades , disposed of bodies and painted over graffiti in Tripoli , witnesses said . 
On state television , Gadhafi -- wearing a fur trooper 's hat and addressing a crowd of supporters -- threatened to escalate the violence . 
`` We can destroy any assault with the people 's will , with the armed people , '' he said . 
`` And when it is necessary , the weapons depots will be open to all the Libyan people to be armed . '' 
At that time , he continued , `` Libya will become a red fire , Libya will become an ember . '' 
He vowed to overcome what he described as external forces attempting to take down his nation . 
`` We will defeat any foreign attempt like we defeated them before , like we did with the Italian colonization , like we did with American airstrikes . '' 
But he presented a carrot with his stick , offering to increase state salaries by 150 % and to give $ 400 to each family . 
Earlier , Gadhafi 's son said his father has no intention of stepping down . 
Asked if Gadhafi has a `` Plan B '' to leave Libya , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi told CNN Turk : `` We have Plan A , Plan B , Plan C. Plan A is to live and die in Libya . 
Plan B is to live and die in Libya . 
Plan C is to live and die in Libya . '' 
He said he hoped Libya would emerge from the crisis united . 
`` I am sure Libya will have a better future , '' he said . 
`` However , such a strong state as we are , we will never allow our people to be controlled by a handful of terrorists . 
This will never happen . '' 
But global leaders were meeting Friday to talk about what kind of pressure can be brought on Gadhafi to surrender control and limit the humanitarian consequences . 
White House press secretary Jay Carney said Washington was suspending embassy operations in Tripoli and pursuing sanctions . 
`` It has been shuttered , '' he told reporters about the embassy . 
But State Department officials said they still have channels through which they can still communicate with the Libyan government . 
Libyan employees were remaining at the embassy , said Under Secretary ofState for Management Patrick Kennedy . 
`` The flag is still flying . 
The embassy is not closed . 
Operations are suspended , '' he said . 
`` Relations are not broken . '' 
The charge d'affaires at the embassy , Joan Polaschik , expressed relief that she and other Americans had left . 
`` It 's a very dangerous and fluid situation , '' she told CNN in a telephone interview from Istanbul , Turkey . 
But she praised the Libyan forces who were charged with providing security for the embassy . 
`` They stayed with me till the bitter end , '' she said . 
The United Nations Security Council discussed a proposed draft resolution that would impose new sanctions on Libya . 
They include an arms embargo , asset freeze and a travel ban . 
The draft also refers Libya to the International Criminal Court . 
An Obama administration official involved in deliberations regarding sanctions told CNN that the Libyan government has said it has as much as $ 130 billion in reserves and another $ 70 billion in foreign assets held abroad . 
The legally binding resolution is backed by the possible threat of force but approval of such measures could be stalled by Russia and China , both unlikely to support military intervention . 
A vote on the resolution could occur Saturday . 
CNN crew greeted as ` liberating heroes ' NATO Secretary-General Anders Rasmussen said the alliance has assets that can be used in this crisis and that it could `` act as an enabler and coordinator , if and when , individual member states want to take action . '' 
Meanwhile , foreign nationals faced a `` massive challenge , '' Rasmussen said , as they braved rough seas to escape the violence in the north African nation . 
A British ship left Benghazi -- the nation 's second-largest city -- with 207 people on board . 
A ferry carrying 338 people -- 183 of them Americans -- departed Tripoli Friday and arrived in Malta at night . 
`` I feel for the people who are still there and did n't get a chance to get out , because it 's chaos , '' said Yusra Tekbalim , one of the passengers . 
She said she had remained hunkered down in her house for four days , during which she heard what sounded like machine-gun fire . 
`` I think that the Libyans know what this regime is capable of , but I think for the first time the world is actually seeing it , '' she said . 
Another ferry arrived in Malta from Tripoli carrying more than 300 people , including 200 employees of Schlumberger , the oil and gas technology , and their families , a company spokeswoman said . 
Libya 's uprising , after four decades of Gadhafi 's iron rule , took root first in the nation 's eastern province . 
Benghazi and other smaller eastern towns are no longer within Gadhafi 's control . 
But closer to Tripoli , where the dictator maintains some support , protesters were still being met with brute force . 
The city of Zawiya -- about 55 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli -- was the epicenter of violent protests Thursday . 
Doctors at a field hospital said early Friday that 17 people were killed and 150 more wounded when government forces attacked . 
CNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya . 
The Libyan government maintains tight control of communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . 
CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . 
Anti-government forces said they had gained control of Zawiya as Gadhafi accused followers of Osama bin Laden of adding hallucinogenic drugs to residents ' drinks to spark the unrest . 
`` They put it with milk or with other drinks , spiked drinks , '' he said Thursday in a telephone call to state television . 
The international fallout , like the protests , has also spread . 
Switzerland ordered Gadhafi 's assets frozen , the foreign ministry said .

2011-02-26,"By the CNN Wire Staff UN to discuss sanctions against Libya Member nations vote unanimously in favor of the resolution It refers the violent crackdown in Libya to the International Criminal Court The sanctions include an arms embargo , an asset freeze and a travel ban Gadhafi has faced sanctions before , in the aftermath of the Lockerbie bombing United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously Saturday to impose sanctions on Libya amid Moammar Gadhafi 's escalating attacks on anti-government protesters . 
The approved resolution includes an arms embargo , asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and several of his key associates . 
It also refers the violent crackdown to the International Criminal Court . 
`` The text send a strong message that gross violations of basic human rights will not be tolerated and that those responsible for grave crimes will be held accountable . 
I hope the message is heard , and heeded , by the regime in Libya , '' said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . 
Ibrahim Dabbashi , Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations who earlier voiced opposition to Gadhafi 's government , said after the vote the resolution would provide moral support to the people resisting in Libya . 
He urged officers in the armed forces to renounce Gadhafi . 
State Dept. ` concerned ' for Libyans One point of contention revolved around language in the resolution that referred to adopting `` all necessary measures to enable the return to Libya of humanitarian agencies and to secure the prompt and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need . '' 
There was concern that the language could be interpreted as including military intervention . 
That section of the resolution was softened in the approved version to call on member states to work together to `` facilitate and support '' the return of humanitarian agencies . 
Gerard Araud , France 's ambassador to the United Nations , described the pace of the resolution proceedings earlier in the day as `` an earthquake . '' 
The United Nations estimates that 1,000 people have been killed since the Libyan uprising began last week . 
Ban had urged the Security Council to come up with immediate actions against Gadhafi 's regime . 
`` In these circumstances , the loss of time means more loss of lives , '' Ban told the 15-member body Friday . 
The session Saturday comes the day after Libyan Ambassador Mohamed Shalgam made an impassioned appeal to his United Nations counterparts . 
`` I hope within hours , not days , that they can do something tangible , '' he said . 
Some , however , were skeptical of the sanctions and said they would not have teeth . 
Fouad Ajami of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies told CNN that Gadhafi had survived sanctions once before , in the aftermath of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland . 
`` The sanctions never worked , '' he said . 
`` Anyone with money can break these sanctions . ''

2011-02-26,"Sat Feb 26 , 2011 4:36 pm EST -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Armed might alone will not save Muammar Gaddafi , but even with an army shrunk by desertions the Libyan leader has the firepower to foment chaos or possibly civil war . 
Analysts monitoring Libya 's crisis say the most likely outcome is that rebels eventually take the capital and either kill or capture him and a hardcore group of loyalists . 
Many who know Gaddafi say he will fight to the finish , even though his 41-year-old rule looks increasingly uncertain after the loss of several cities and defections by soldiers , local and national officials and diplomats . 
In an ominous sign for Gaddafi , poor neighborhoods of Tripoli openly defied him at a funeral on Saturday , and security forces abandoned the working-class Tajoura district after five days of demonstrations , residents said . 
Libya 's former justice minister , Mustafa Mohamed Abud Ajleil , has led the formation of an interim government based in the eastern city of Benghazi , Libya 's Quryna newspaper reported . 
Defeat may not be swift , and in the short term it is not the only possibility . 
Here are other scenarios . 
GADDAFI FIGHTS BACK , A STANDOFF WITH THE REBELS ENSUES With several thousand troops backed by heavy armor deployed around the capital , and pro-Gaddafi gunmen violently suppressing dissent inside it , Gaddafi may have enough firepower for now to stop any opposition gains in the city , said Jon Marks , chairman of Britain 's Cross Border Information consultancy . 
Marks said dissidents in the capital were waiting `` for reinforcements . '' 
But help might not arrive if Gaddafi 's son Khamees , who leads the army 's reportedly powerful 32nd Brigade , crushes advances on the approach roads to the city , he said . 
In addition hundreds and possibly thousands of armed internal security agents in Tripoli would be on alert for any attempt by the opposition to quietly infiltrate armed men into the capital from outlying areas , security experts say . 
Military experts estimate Gaddafi can count on 10,000 to 12,000 troops , not counting loyalists in the security services and mercenaries . 
He also controls Tripoli airport and the port . 
A standoff might give Gaddafi time to deploy economic or paramilitary means to shore up links with any tribes that have not yet declared themselves for the rebels . 
GADDAFI FLEES TRIPOLI , STARTS DESERT INSURGENCY London-based Algerian lawyer Saad Djebbar , who knows a large number of Gaddafi 's top officials , says that for Gaddafi staying in power had become impossible . 
`` It 's about staying alive . '' 
`` He will create conditions for guerrilla warfare , that 's why he invited Libyans to take weapons , '' he said . 
Gaddafi may flee to the southern desert area of Sebha where his tribe is from and try to destabilise country from there . 
He might also try to flee to his hometown of Sirte , but this may be too risky -- it is near the east , which is in rebel hands . 
`` Someone like him must have already made some hideouts in the desert , '' said Djebbar . 
Geoff Porter , an independent U.S. analyst , said he could envisage the crisis ending up as a `` manhunt , '' adding : `` He could well go to ground with loyal henchmen . 
So he may fall from power , but his whereabouts may not be known for weeks . '' 
GADDAFI FLEES TRIPOLI , TRIBES AGREE TRUCE TO PREVENT CHAOS Djebbar said Gaddafi 's `` time is over . 
But how much damage he will cause before leaving is the question . '' 
He said the amount of disruption that would follow a defeat of Gaddafi depended on the loyalty of his tribesmen and relatives . 
At some stage , Gaddafi 's Gaddadfa tribe would decide to negotiate with other tribes and agree to cease hostilities . 
Libya expert Mansour El-Kikhia says rifts in the Gaddadfa had already opened up between loyalists and dissidents . 
The Gaddadfa want to do everything to avoid being persecuted by vengeful authorities in a future post-Gaddafi Libya . 
Ajleil said Libya was not in a phase of score-settling and the Gaddadfa were forgiven , Quryna said . 
GADDAFI FOMENTS A FULLY-FLEDGED CIVIL WAR This is seen at present as unlikely . 
But Marks said he could envision a standoff between `` a weird sort of city state ruled by this rump of Gaddafi forces , and the rest of the country ruled by an opposition that lacks the clout to take the capital quickly . 
If that endures , you may end up with a civil war . 
Djebbar said that the longer Gaddafi continued crushing protests , the more difficult it would be for his tribe to negotiate a peaceful settlement . 
GADDAFI IS TOPPLED , FLEES ABROAD Djebbar said he could envision Gaddafi 's closest relatives pushing him to negotiate with allied tribal leaders and senior officers to obtain safe passage to leave the country . 
`` We have noticed how many of his henchmen who have defected sought refuge with their tribes or fiefdom , which highlights the importance of tribes in determining Gaddafi 's future . 
`` So he , or his relatives , can tell allied tribes ` I 'll cease the hostility on condition I leave for some country without facing trial . '' 
Few countries are expected to be willing to take Gaddafi . 
And once abroad he might be vulnerable to any future attempt to extradite him for prosecution on war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague .

2011-02-26,"Time to go , U.S. tells Gaddafi , as revolt closes in TRIPOLI | Sat Feb 26 , 2011 6:49 pm EST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi 's grip on Libya looked ever more tenuous on Saturday , as his police abandoned parts of the capital Tripoli to a popular revolt that has swept the country and the United States bluntly told him he must go . 
In the oil-rich east around the second city of Benghazi , freed a week ago by a disparate coalition of people power and defecting military units , a former minister of Gaddafi announced the formation of an `` interim government '' to reunite the country . 
At Tripoli in the west , the 68-year-old Brother Leader 's redoubt was shrinking . 
Reuters correspondents found residents in some neighborhoods of the capital barricading their streets and proclaiming open defiance after security forces melted away . 
Western leaders , their rhetoric emboldened by evacuations that have sharply reduced the number of their citizens stranded in the oilfields and cities of the sprawling desert state , spoke out more clearly to say Gaddafi 's 41-year rule must now end . 
`` When a leader 's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people , he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now , '' aides to U.S. President Barack Obama said in describing a call on Libya he had with German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also showed a harder tone from Washington , which had warmed to Gaddafi in recent years after decades of sanctions : '' -LRB- He -RRB- has lost the confidence of his people and he should go without further bloodshed and violence . '' 
A vote in the United Nations Security Council was imminent . 
It may impose sanctions and say Gaddafi should face war crimes charges over deaths , estimated by diplomats at some 2,000 , during his 10 days of efforts to stem the tide of revolution . 
Talk of possible military action by foreign governments remained vague , however . 
It was unclear how long Gaddafi , with some thousands of loyalists , some his tribesmen , others military units commanded by his sons , might hold out against rebel forces comprised of youthful gunmen and mutinous soldiers . 
Correspondents in Tripoli reported occasional gunfire after dark but could not assess the balance of forces in the city . 
London-based Algerian lawyer Saad Djebbar , who knows a large number of Gaddafi 's top officials , says that for Gaddafi staying in power had become impossible . 
`` It 's about staying alive . '' '' 
-LRB- Gaddafi 's -RRB- time is over , '' he added . 
`` But how much damage he will cause before leaving is the question . '' 
One key element in the opposition 's efforts to unseat him may be tribal loyalties , always a factor in the desert nation of six million and one which Gaddafi , despite official rhetoric to the contrary , tended to reinforce down the years . 
His former justice minister Mustafa Mohamed Abud Ajleil , now gone over to the opposition in Benghazi , was quoted by the online edition of the Quryna newspaper as saying that an interim government , whose status remained unclear , would `` forgive '' his large Gaddadfa tribe for `` crimes '' committed by the leader . 
Such declarations may be intended to erode Gaddafi 's efforts to rally supporters into a do-or-die defense of the old guard . 
One of his sons , the London-educated Saif al-Islam , again appeared on television on Saturday to deny that much of Libya was in revolt . 
But he also warned : `` What the Libyan nation is going through has opened the door to all options , and now the signs of civil war and foreign interference have started . '' 
Gaddafi , once branded a `` mad dog '' by Washington for his support of militant groups worldwide , has been embraced by the West in recent years in return for renouncing some weapons programs and , critically , for opening up Libya 's oilfields . 
While money has flowed into Libya , many people , especially in the long-restive and oil-rich east , have seen little benefit and , inspired by the popular overthrow of veteran strongmen in Tunisia and Egypt , on either side of their country , they rose up to demand better conditions and political freedoms last week . 
Particular condemnation has been reserved for aerial bombing by government forces and for reported indiscriminate attacks by Gaddafi loyalists and mercenaries on unarmed protesters . 
`` Gaddafi is the enemy of God ! '' 
a crowd chanted on Saturday in Tajoura , a poor neighborhood of Tripoli , at the funeral of a man they said was shot down by Gaddafi loyalists the day before . 
Now , residents said , those security forces had disappeared . 
Locals had erected barricades of rocks and palm trees across rubbish-strewn streets , and graffiti covered many walls . 
Gaddafi 's forces were nowhere to be seen but bullet holes in the walls of the tightly packed houses bore testimony to violence . 
The residents , still unwilling to be identified for fear of reprisals , said troops fired on demonstrators who tried to march from Tajoura to central Green Square overnight , killing at least five people . 
The number could not be independently confirmed . 
A funeral on Saturday morning for one of the victims turned into another show of defiance . 
`` We will demonstrate again and again , today , tomorrow , the day after tomorrow until they change , '' a man who called himself Ali , aged 25 , told Reuters . 
Libyan state television again showed a crowd chanting their loyalty to Gaddafi in Tripoli 's Green Square on Saturday . 
But journalists estimated their number at scarcely 200 . 
From Misrata , a major city 200 km -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , residents and exile groups said by telephone that a thrust by forces loyal to Gaddafi , operating from the local airport , had been rebuffed with bloodshed by the opposition . 
`` There were violent clashes last night and in the early hours of the morning near the airport , '' one resident , Mohammed , told Reuters . 
`` An extreme state of alert prevails in the city . '' 
He said several mercenaries from Chad had been detained by rebels in Misrata . 
The report could not be verified but was similar to accounts elsewhere of Gaddafi deploying fighters brought in from African states where has long had allies . 
Protesters in Zawiyah , an oil refining town on the main coastal highway 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , have fought off government forces for several nights , according to witnesses who fled across the nearby Tunisian border at Ras Jdir . 
At Tripoli 's international airport , thousands of desperate foreign workers besieged the main gate trying to leave the country as police used batons and whips to keep them out . 
Outside the main terminal was a sprawling camp of makeshift tents and people huddled together in the cold , wrapped in blankets and surrounded by heaps of clothes , food and garbage . 
Britain and France followed the United States in closing their embassies . 
Britain sent in air force troop carriers to take some 150 oil workers out of camps in the desert . 
Libya supplies 2 percent of the world 's oil , the bulk of it from wells and supply terminals in the east . 
The prospect of it being shut off -- as well as speculation that the unrest in the Arab world could spread to the major exporters of the Gulf -- has pushed oil prices up to highs not seen in over two years . 
In recent days , the flamboyant Gaddafi has made several appearances railing against his enemies as rats and cockroaches and blaming the unrest on a range of foes from the United States and Israel to al Qaeda militants and youths high on drugs . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It will be not long now . 
The only question is will he fall on his sword or be hung high by his people . 
Obama SERIOUSLY needs to order a CIA team to pinpoint him and call in a few Cruise Missiles .

2011-02-28,"Gadhafi denies Libyans oppose him By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi tells the BBC and ABC News that he blames al Qaeda for holding the city of Benghazi . 
`` They love me , all my people with me , '' Gadhafi says `` No demonstration at all in the streets , '' he tells ABC and BBC in a joint interview Obama `` a good man '' but misinformed -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared Monday either to not know that demonstrators in cities throughout Libya are calling for an end to his rule or not accept it , according to excerpts from the interview , which a U.S. official described as `` delusional . '' 
`` No demonstration at all in the streets , '' he told ABC News and the BBC in a joint interview carried out at a restaurant in Tripoli , excerpts of which were posted on the BBC 's website . 
Told by the BBC 's Jeremy Bowen that he had seen demonstrators in the streets that morning , Gadhafi asked , `` Are they supporting us ? '' 
Gadhafi , wearing sunglasses and clad in brown tribal clothing , refused to accept the reporter 's assertion that they were not . 
No one against us . 
Against me for what ? '' 
He repeated his assertion that he is not president , but one of the people . 
`` They love me , all my people with me , they love me all . 
They will die to protect me , my people . 
No , no. '' Gadhafi : ` My people will die for me ' What are U.S. options for Libya ? 
Asked why his people had captured and were holding the nation 's second-largest city , Benghazi , Gadhafi said it was al Qaeda , not the Libyan people , who had done so . 
`` Al Qaeda , '' he said . 
`` They came from outside . '' 
ABC 's Christiane Amanpour , in a posting on the network 's website , said Gadhafi arrived for the interview in a small convoy of sedans accompanied by little security . 
`` Gadhafi said he wanted to speak to the press to get the truth out , and he spent more than an hour with us trying to put forth his side of the story , '' Amanpour wrote . 
He questioned how the international community could freeze his assets , impose sanctions and embargo arms sales based on media reports , and invited the United Nations to carry out an independent `` fact-finding mission , '' she reported . 
He vowed not to leave Libya , she reported , and denied having used force against his people . 
`` He seemed to be in complete denial about the protests against him , and that other big cities in Libya , particularly those in the east , had been taken by his opponents , '' she said . 
`` He simply rejected the notion that any walls were closing in on him . 
He denied he was besieged in the capital and said he would survive the current situation . '' 
He reiterated an assertion he first made last week that his opponents have been given hallucinogens by al Qaeda operatives , and he said he felt betrayed by the United States , which had lifted its sanctions on the country after Gadhafi agreed to give up his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction in 2003 . 
`` I 'm surprised that we have an alliance with the West to fight al Qaeda , and now that we are fighting terrorists they have abandoned us , '' he said , according to Amanpour . 
`` Perhaps they want to occupy Libya . '' 
Gadhafi called U.S. President Barack Obama a `` good man '' but said he might have been given `` misinformation . '' 
`` The statements I have heard from him must have come from someone else , '' Gadhafi said . 
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice was unimpressed . 
`` It sounds , just frankly , delusional , '' she told reporters . 
`` And when he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality . 
`` It makes all the more important the urgent steps that we have taken over the course of the last week on a national basis , as well as the steps that we 've taken collectively through the United Nations and the Security Council , and we 're going to continue to keep the pressure on . '' 
She called on Gadhafi `` to step aside to prevent further bloodshed and to allow the Libyan people to have a government that is responsive to their aspirations . '' 
"
2011-02-28,"By the CNN Wire Staff Gadhafi : ` My people will die for me ' NEW : U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations says Gadhafi is `` slaughtering his own people '' Gadhafi denies there have been protests and use of force U.S. Secretary of State Clinton : Libyans have made clear Gadhafi must go Protesters in Tripoli say they fear demonstrating will bring violence Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi flatly denied Monday the existence of the protests threatening to end his 41-year rule , as reports of fighting between government forces and rebels raged another day . 
In a joint interview with ABC News ' Christiane Amanpour and the BBC , Gadhafi also denied using force against his people , Amanpour reported . 
Excerpts of the interview were posted on the networks ' websites . 
`` No demonstration at all in the streets , '' he said , speaking at a restaurant in Tripoli . 
Told by the BBC 's Jeremy Bowen that he had seen demonstrators in the streets that morning , Gadhafi asked , `` Are they supporting us ? '' 
`` They love me , all my people with me , they love me all . 
They will die to protect me , my people , '' he said . 
Government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators over the past two weeks in Libya , fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets , numerous witnesses have told CNN . 
The death toll has topped 1,000 , according to an estimate from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . 
UN imposes sanctions on Libya Clinton outraged at Libya , Iran Gadhafi control wanes outside Tripoli Soon after Gadhafi 's interview , U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said the Libyan strongman sounded `` delusional . '' 
`` And when he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality , '' she said . 
Gadhafi 's regime has lost control of parts of the country to rebel forces , and with each passing day more Libyan officials around the world have defected , joining calls for his ouster . 
The use of the term `` rebel '' to describe the anti-government forces is apt , said Kurt Volker , former U.S. ambassador to NATO and now a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Forces . 
`` In Egypt , you did n't have a force that was developed ; you had protesters who were demonstrating against the government and the government relented , '' he told CNN in a telephone interview . 
`` Here , you actually have a government that retains force at its disposal and you have demonstrators joined by elements of the military that have forces at their disposal . 
So it really has become an armed rebellion . '' 
Even as Gadhafi sought to project confidence Monday , reports came in that a military jet bombed a military base in an area controlled by rebel forces . 
The base is near Ajdabiya , 90 miles south of Benghazi , a stronghold of government opponents . 
Some bases in the area have fallen into the hands of protesters as more members of the military have abandoned Gadhafi 's regime and joined demonstrations . 
Several soldiers told CNN they switched their allegiance after refusing to use weapons against peaceful demonstrators . 
CNN saw the military jet fly overhead and heard the sounds of explosions . 
Witnesses reported a bombing at the base . 
But Libyan state television later denied any such bombing had occurred . 
The Temporary General Committee for Defense said reports that the Libyan air force conducted strikes on the ammunition depots in the cities of Ajdabiya and Rajima were false , state TV reported . 
While CNN has staff in some cities , the network can not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya . 
CNN has gathered information through telephone interviews with witnesses . 
Pro-Gadhafi forces also tried to attack a radio station in Misrata , a city controlled by protesters , a witness said . 
A military chopper with soldiers on board has tried to land a couple of times over the past three days , but the opposition fired at the soldiers and kept them away , the witness said . 
The international community , meanwhile , launched new efforts Monday to pressure Gadhafi to halt the violence . 
Senators take tough stance on Libya Gadhafi 's history of tension with the West `` He has lost his legitimacy when he declared war on his people , '' Secretary-General Ban said about embattled Libyan leader , urging him to heed the call of his people . 
Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said the United States is `` repositioning '' naval and air forces in the region to be prepared for any option that it may need to exercise . 
He would not comment on whether any ground forces are being put on alert or having leaves canceled because of Libya . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at a meeting in Geneva , Switzerland , of the U.N. Human Rights Council that the United States is exploring `` all possible options , '' and that `` nothing is off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens . '' 
`` Colonel Gadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts , which violate international legal obligations and common decency . 
Through their actions , they have lost the legitimacy to govern . 
And the people of Libya have made themselves clear : It is time for Gadhafi to go , now , without further violence or delay , '' she said . 
Asked at a news conference whether the U.S. planned an imminent military response , Clinton said , `` No. '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that `` exile is certainly one option '' for Gadhafi . 
Carney also said the U.S. government is considering the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya . 
Also Monday , the United States became the latest country to announce it had frozen Gadhafi-related assets . 
The U.S. government froze at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets under U.S jurisdiction after enacting sanctions on Friday , a Treasury official said . 
It marked the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program , according to Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen . 
In Tripoli , protesters stayed off the streets , telling CNN they feared violence . 
Government officials spread word that thousands of people could die if the popular uprising continues . 
On the 14th day of protests , there appeared to be a stalemate . 
Some in Tripoli told CNN they feared their protest movement was losing momentum . 
But around the world , support for the protests was growing . 
Yet another prominent Libyan official , the country 's ambassador to South Africa , added his voice to the calls for Gadhafi to end his nearly 42-year grip on power . 
Gadhafi `` should take the ultimate decision to step down in the interest of Libya , '' Abdullah Alzubedi told reporters in Pretoria . 
The European Union 's high representative for foreign affairs , Catherine Ashton , said the U.N. Human Rights Council `` has a grave responsibility to ensure that our often-stated intentions are translated into real actions and real progress . '' 
Speaking at the meeting in Geneva , Ashton said , `` What matters in the end is not the number of resolutions passed but results in the real world . '' 
In an interview with CNN , Ashton said stopping the violence means trying `` to persuade the people concerned that they will be held to account , that there will be the International Criminal Court , that we will stop their assets being moved , that we will hold them to account for their actions . 
That 's what we do as an international community . 
That 's what we have to make clear . 
And there 's no doubt in my mind that actually they do listen to what 's being said . '' 
The U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime . 
The Security Council measures -- which include an arms embargo , an asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and members of his family and associates -- also referred the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court . 
On Sunday , Gadhafi criticized the Security Council resolution , telling private Serbian station Pink TV by phone that council members `` took a decision based on media reports that are based abroad . '' 
He added , `` If the Security Council wants to know about something , they should have sent a fact-finding committee . '' 
The protests , which began February 15 , have been fueled largely by people demanding freedom and decrying high unemployment . 
As the 68-year-old Gadhafi has appeared increasingly cornered , some Libyan officials have begun to discuss openly what a post-Gadhafi Libyan government would look like . 
Over the weekend , Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , Ibrahim Dabbashi , indicated he and fellow diplomats support `` in principle '' a caretaker administration under the direction of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil . 
Jalil quit February 21 to protest the `` bloody situation '' and `` use of excessive force '' against unarmed protesters , according to Libyan newspaper Quryna . 
Dabbashi told CNN Monday that Gadhafi has asked for a change in Libya 's U.N. representation , though the diplomat vowed to stay on to represent the people . 
About 100,000 people have fled Libya to Tunisia or Egypt in roughly the past week , the U.N. high commissioner for refugees said Sunday , citing reports from the Tunisian and Egyptian governments . 
The evacuees include Tunisians , Egyptians , Libyans and many from Asian countries . 
Tunisia and Egypt are the two countries that have seen their leaders overthrown in the wave of protests that has swept through the Arab world over the past several weeks . 
Tunisians on the border with Libya waved pre-Gadhafi-era Libyan flags in support of the opposition . 
The Tunisian army , charities and ordinary Tunisians were trying to help Libyans on the border . 
Refugees said Tunisians were offering them food , water and the use of phones .

2011-02-28,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three key Republican senators said Monday they oppose a proposal by Sen. Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut , to arm rebels in Libya fighting Moammar Gadhafi . 
They had mixed thoughts on whether the United States should be involved in imposing a no-fly zone in that country to protect protestors from attacks by Libyan war planes . 
I would not suggest either of those courses for the moment , said Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee who indicated U.S. involvement could lead to war . 
Depending upon the method of delivery and what we decide to do we could decide to have a war in Libya to join the war in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , a member of the Armed Services Committee , said she would be leery of providing arms at this point but said she supports a no-fly zone . 
I do believe our allies may be able to join together with us to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya to help protect the people from Gadhafi , she said . 
Any actions that we take I believe should be in concert with our allies . 
Sen. Lindsay Graham , R-South Carolina , who is also on the Armed Services Committee , credited the diplomatic efforts underway by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and suggested the U.S. work with the United Nations to stiffen and enforce sanctions against Libya . 
Providing arms , I m not sure that helps us , Graham said . 
I don t know if you could control right now who would get the arms . 
What I would suggest is that we really keep implementing U.N. sanctions on the economic side , on the travel side , go after assets , Graham added . 
And a no fly zone would make a lot of sense to me . 
The three senators spoke in a Capitol hallway after a vote on the Senate floor . 
Earlier Monday , Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he would withhold judgment on the idea from Lieberman , who made his comments Sunday on CNN s State of the Union . 
McConnell said he has asked Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee , to brief Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch in the Capitol Tuesday about his trip to Egypt over the weekend . 
Lieberman traveled to Egypt with McCain , and they appeared together on CNN Sunday . 
McCain supported the idea of a no-fly zone but did not say if he supports providing arms to Libyans fighting Gadhafi . 
A no fly zone is a UN scenario ! 
February 28 , 2011 09:57 pm at 9:57 pm | Liebermans take on anything in the middle east is an opinion that no one should listen to , and Bomb Bomb McCain lost all judgement and respect the day he brought the Palin Plague to the forefront . 
Lieberman works for another country and can not be trusted and starting another war is just another way Republicans think they can get out of creating jobs like they promised to get back in the house . 
February 28 , 2011 10:11 pm at 10:11 pm | What is it with Mccain and Lieberman ? 
We cant even afford these other two wars we are fighting , and they are ready to get neck deep in Libya ?

Makeup your mind already . 
You criticize the late response by Obama and wished he had done something sooner and now You have a problem with siding with the rebels ? 
February 28 , 2011 10:17 pm at 10:17 pm | Apparently , the opposition has not agreed to give U.S. companies first rights on the oil . 
If it had , Congress would declared war by now , and U.S. troops would be ready to land . 
Unfortunately , we 've been there , done that with Iraq already , but do n't put it past these oligarphic puppets to do it all over again . 
February 28 , 2011 10:39 pm at 10:39 pm | Although the Republicans do n't know what to do , they do agree that whatever Obama is doing is bad for America and too slow and indecisive . 
February 28 , 2011 10:44 pm at 10:44 pm | Please let us send Obama to Libya with a one way ticket so he can harm that nation and stop pushing the US towards a second c i v i l war . 
February 28 , 2011 10:53 pm at 10:53 pm | I agree that we should not be arming these groups in Libya . 
Once their current leadership is out and new government can be looked at , then we can decide if we are to sell them weapons . 
February 28 , 2011 11:22 pm at 11:22 pm | February 28 , 2011 11:30 pm at 11:30 pm | At last some common sense prevails . 
The time has come for America and Americans to realize just like the brits had to that Gunboat diplomacy or in the US case the threat or actual execution of military intervention on whatever pretext in another sovreign nations affairs is very , very rarely justified or brings the result liked by the invader . 
I must also add I 'm really fed up with the likes of Lieberman and McCain jumping in to criticise the Obama administrations handling of the Libya situation , even no fly zones because the British and German SAS and Airforces respectively were still rescuing thier nations people from outlying areas who worked in the Oil fields . 
The kind of pre-emptive ideas of the above two and liberman sending arms risked leading to another embassy hostage crisis or other similar catastrophe . 
Do they also realize that tens of thousands of non Libyans of mutiple nationalities are still trying to get out and cross borders to flee from a civil war . 
A no fly zone might be realistically imposed thru the UN and NATO . 
For the US to do it alone is not good policy unless you are among many -LRB- too many -RRB- Republicans who think declaring war solves all diplomatic or revolutionary situations anywhere in the world . 
Keep US arms and forces out of Libya ! 
The US has already bankrpted itself fighting unwinable wars in Afghanistan and Iraq we certainly have no need to arm rebels in Libya who could then sell or give the arms to anyone , or start using them against the UN . 
March 1 , 2011 12:37 am at 12:37 am | McCain is the one making awful decisions and Lieberman with him . 
McCain is the one who put the curse of Palin on our nation . 
I seriously question his judgment on anything after choosing Palin .

Why is it Republicans always want a military solution to everything ? 
I love Secretary Gates comments to the West Point cadets that any Sec of Defense who suggests military action in southeast Asia or the Mideast to the President should have his head examined . 
In the case of Rumsfeld , Cheney and Bush - they should be in jail for intentionally starting a fraudulent war in Iraq and breaking international war crimes law on torture .

2011-02-28,"UPDATE 1-Risk Libyan oil down for months - BoA Merrill Lynch \* BoA ML says unrest could hit Libyan output for months \* Market 's ability to cope with more Mideast unrest limited LONDON , Feb 28 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Unrest in Libya could make oil supplies from the North African producer unavailable to the market for months , Bank of America Merrill Lynch said . 
The U.S. bank said initial reports suggested companies had already shut onshore production , and it estimated as much as 1.2 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of crude oil may have been shut down in the country . 
`` With Libya apparently at risk of a civil war , there are reasons to believe that oil supplies in that country could be off for months , '' it said in a note to clients , received by Reuters on Monday . 
It said Libya 's oil infrastructure was on the eastern side of the country and could be prone to attacks by either supporters of Muammar Gaddafi or opposition forces , `` creating the risk of a prolonged output loss '' . 
The bank said it saw substantial upside risks to Brent crude oil LCOc1 prices over the next few months and that its forecasts for oil prices were `` skewed to the upside '' . 
`` The combination of a substantial run-up in demand coupled with a very severe supply shock makes a spike and crash scenario increasingly likely for global oil prices and the world economy , '' it said . 
`` In our opinion , if Brent crude oil prices hold at around $ 110 - $ 115 per barrel in 2011 , energy as a percentage of GDP would remain close to record levels , suggesting that the point of demand destruction is in short sight . '' 
The bank estimated that a 10 percent increase in oil prices pushes down global oil demand by about 0.5 percent . 
It said the oil market 's ability to deal with further unrest in the Middle East remained very limited .

2011-02-28,"Libyan oil output cut by at least half , Saudi steps in PARIS\/RIYADH | Mon Feb 28 , 2011 1:40 pm EST PARIS\/RIYADH -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The uprising in Libya has cut its oil output by half , the International Energy Agency said on Monday , but Saudi Arabia 's pledge to pump more helped to prevent a further surge in the price of oil . 
The head of Italian oil company ENI , the biggest foreign operator in Libya , said he thought two-thirds of Libyan oil and gas output had been halted and warned oil extraction could halt if shipments did not resume . 
Foreign firms have been pulling staff out of Libya due to the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule . 
China 's three major state-owned oil and gas companies have evacuated all their Chinese employees . 
U.S. oil firm Marathon Oil Corp also said it had evacuated all expatriate employees and their dependents from Libya , while ConocoPhillips said it had closed its operations there and evacuated some employees due to the unrest . 
About half of Libya 's 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of production had been cut , IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol told Reuters Insider TV , citing industry reports . 
That is higher than the IEA estimated initially . 
Oil prices jumped toward $ 120 a barrel last week for the first time since 2008 because of the disruption in Libya , the world 's 12th largest oil exporter . 
Prices have since eased to $ 112 , partly because Saudi Arabia has promised to meet any shortages . 
`` This is not good news for suppliers in the market but at the same time it is very comforting that Saudi Arabia showed their readiness to make up , '' Birol told Reuters in the interview . 
All demands for extra oil have been met , the head of Saudi state oil company Saudi Aramco said on Monday . 
The kingdom has boosted its output to around 9 million bpd , a senior Saudi source told Reuters , to meet demand . 
`` All incremental needs requested by our customers have been met , '' Saudi Aramco CEO Khalid al-Falih said . 
As well as the scale of the loss of Libya 's oil , the duration of the shutdown is also a concern to oil markets . 
Some analysts expect it may be out for a while . 
`` With Libya apparently at risk of a civil war , there are reasons to believe that oil supplies in that country could be off for months , '' Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note . 
Libya 's oil exports and oil tanker loadings remained at a virtual standstill . 
The country exports about 1.3 million bpd of high-quality crude , mostly to Europe . 
The size of the cut in Libya 's oil output remains unclear partly because of disrupted communications with the country . 
Eni 's chief executive , Paolo Scaroni , said on Monday he thought two-thirds of Libyan oil and gas output had been halted . 
He had put the disruption at 1.2 million bpd , or 75 percent , last week . 
Most of Libya 's oilfields are no longer under Gaddafi 's control , the European Union 's energy commissioner said on Monday . 
A unit of Libya 's state-owned National Oil Corp has decided to operate separately from its parent until Gaddafi is overthrown and Tripoli is free of his rule , an official said .

2011-02-28,"TRIPOLI | Mon Feb 28 , 2011 10:35 pm GMT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States and other foreign governments discussed military options for dealing with Libya on Monday as Muammar Gaddafi scoffed at the threat to his government from a spreading popular uprising . 
With government forces massing to try to take back strategic coastal cities from rebels , the United States said it was moving U.S. naval and air forces closer to Libya . 
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said Washington was in talks with its NATO partners and other allies about military options . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron said his government would work to prepare for a `` no-fly '' zone in Libya to protect the people from attacks by Gaddafi 's forces . 
Gaddafi himself rejected calls for him to step down and dismissed the strength of the uprising against his 41-year rule that has ended his control over eastern Libya and is closing in on the capital Tripoli . 
`` All my people love me . 
They would die to protect me , '' he said in a joint interview with U.S. ABC network and the BBC on Monday . 
He denied using his air force to attack protesters but said planes had bombed military sites and ammunition depots . 
He also denied there had been demonstrations and said young people were given drugs by al Qaeda and therefore took to the streets . 
Libyan forces had orders not to fire back at them . 
Gaddafi said he felt betrayed by the United States and accused Western countries of abandoning his government in its fight against `` terrorists . '' 
U.S. President Barack Obama appeared to be misinformed about the situation , he added . 
Gaddafi , 68 , looked relaxed and laughed at times during the interview at a restaurant on Tripoli 's Mediterranean coast . 
Ambassador Rice called him `` delusional . '' 
As the uprising entered its third week , the exact situation on the ground was often hard for reporters to assess due to the difficulties of moving around some parts of the desert nation and patchy communications . 
But witnesses in Misrata , a city of a half a million people 200 km -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- to the east of Tripoli , and Zawiyah , a strategic refinery town 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- to the west , said government forces were mounting or preparing attacks . 
`` An aircraft was shot down this morning while it was firing on the local radio station . 
Protesters captured its crew , '' a witness in Misrata , Mohamed , told Reuters by telephone . 
A battle for the military air base was also under way , he said , although a Libyan government source denied the report . 
A resident of Zawiyah called Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone that brigades commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis were on the outskirts of the town and looked ready to attack . 
In Tripoli , Gaddafi 's last stronghold , several people were killed and others wounded on Monday when forces loyal to Gaddafi opened fire to disperse a protest in Tajoura neighborhood , Morocco 's Quryna newspaper reported . 
The protest gathered close to 10,000 protesters , the Libyan newspaper said , quoting its correspondent . 
`` When the protesters reached the Souk Juma -LRB- market -RRB- , they were joined by armed men from the Gaddafi battalion who were dressed as civilians and opened fire on the unarmed youths . 
Many among the youths were wounded and killed , '' it said . 
In Tripoli , queues outside bakeries and soaring rice and flour prices fuelled public anger . 
`` There is n't enough food , '' said Basim , 25 , a bank employee , adding that many workers in the public sector had yet to receive salaries for February . 
Crowds of people also massed outside state banks , which have started distributing handouts of about $ 400 per family in an effort by Gaddafi 's government to drum up support . 
Foreign governments increased the pressure on Gaddafi to leave in the hope of ending fighting that has claimed at least 1,000 lives and restoring order to a country that accounts for 2 percent of the world 's oil production . 
The U.N. Security Council on Saturday slapped sanctions on Gaddafi and other Libyan officials , imposed an arms embargo and froze Libyan assets . 
European Union governments approved their sanctions against Gaddafi in Brussels on Monday . 
The United States , whose Sixth Fleet operates out of Italy , said it was moving U.S. naval and air forces closer to Libya and working on various contingency plans . 
`` We 're still in that planning and preparing mode should we be called upon to do any of those types of missions , whether humanitarian and otherwise , '' Pentagon spokesman Colonel David Lapan said in Washington . 
Prime Minister Cameron , speaking in parliament , urged Gaddafi to step down and said all measures would be considered to pressure him to go . 
`` We do not in any way rule out the use of military assets , '' Cameron said . 
`` I have asked the Ministry of Defense and the Chief of the Defense Staff to work with our allies on plans for a military no-fly zone . '' 
Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said his government would ask the United Nations to approve a no-fly zone . 
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini of Italy -- formerly Libya 's closest ally in Europe -- told Reuters a no-fly zone was a useful measure . 
Italy would consider allowing allies to use its bases but the Security Council must first approve the measure , he said . 
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen distanced himself from talk of an imminent implementation , saying the Security Council resolution excluded the use of armed forces and did not mention a no-fly zone . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that Gaddafi was using `` mercenaries and thugs '' to repress his people and that he must step down immediately . 
Revolutions in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt have helped to ignite resentment of four decades of often bloody political repression under Gaddafi as well as his failure to use Libya 's oil wealth to tackle widespread poverty and lack of opportunity . 
Regional experts expect rebels eventually to take the capital and kill or capture Gaddafi but say he has the firepower to foment chaos or civil war . 
Opposition forces are largely in control of Libya 's oil facilities , which are mostly located in the east . 
Industry reports suggested Libya 's oil output had been halved as expatriate workers pulled out , Fatih Birol , chief economist of the International Energy Agency , said . 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated in a note to clients that Libya was losing about 1.2 million barrels per day , or 75 percent of its pre-revolt output , and said the unrest could mean Libyan supplies were unavailable for months . 
Industry sources said actual shipments were at a standstill . 
Brent crude was around $ 112 a barrel in choppy trading . 
Wealthy states have sent planes and ships to bring home expatriate workers but many more , from poorer countries , are stranded . 
The United Nations refugee agency said nearly 100,000 people have fled the violence in a growing humanitarian crisis .

2011-03-01,"NEW : Ban says further steps on Libya may be necessary U.S. officials have frozen at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets U.S. President Barack Obama meets Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon The European Union has imposed new sanctions against the Libyan regime Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States has frozen at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets , a U.S. Treasury official announced Monday -- one of a series of steps being taken by international leaders designed to break strongman Moammar Gadhafi 's grip on power . 
The $ 30 billion is the largest amount ever blocked under any sanctions program , according to David Cohen , the acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence . 
American officials slapped the sanctions on Libya last Friday , and the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Libya on Saturday . 
President Barack Obama met Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to discuss a variety of measures under consideration . 
Ban later told reporters that `` further action may well be necessary . '' 
UN imposes sanctions on Libya For rebels , a long road to Tripoli Gadhafi `` has lost his legitimacy when he declared war on his people , '' Ban said of the Libyan leader . 
`` This is again a totally unacceptable situation . 
I sincerely hope and urge him to listen to the peoples ' call . 
That 's my message to him . '' 
All options are still on the table , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at a meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva , Switzerland . 
`` Gadhafi and those around him must be held accountable -LRB- for any actions -RRB- which violate international legal obligations and common decency , '' she said . 
`` Through their actions , they have lost the legitimacy to govern . '' 
Susan Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , called Gadhafi `` delusional , '' adding that `` when he -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- can laugh when talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality . '' 
The imposition of a no-fly zone over certain portions of the increasingly chaotic country is among the courses of action being contemplated , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters . 
Carney indicated that exile is `` certainly one option '' for the Libyan leader . 
He also said that American officials are `` actively reaching out '' to Libyan opponents of the ruling regime , Carney said . 
But any speculation on U.S. assistance to the Libyan rebels is premature , Rice said , calling it `` unclear at this point who will emerge as the critical opposition element . 
We await to see how the opposition will coalesce . '' 
Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said the U.S. military is moving Navy ships closer to Libya . 
Two U.S. Navy warships -- the carrier USS Enterprise and the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge -- are currently in the Red Sea and available to assist , U.S. military officials told CNN . 
Lapan refused to indicate whether any American ground forces have been put on a heightened state of alert . 
British PrimeMinister David Cameron echoed Washington 's call for Gadhafi to step aside . 
`` We are taking every step possible to isolate the Gadhafi regime , deprive it of money , shrink its power and ensure that anyone responsible for abuses in Libya will be held to account , '' Cameron told members of Britain 's parliament Monday . 
In Brussels , the European Union banned the sale of arms and ammunition to Libya . 
It also prohibited any trade with Gadhafi 's government that could lead to the acquisition of equipment that could be used for the repression of Libyans . 
The EU also froze the assets of Gadhafi and five members of his family , while imposing a visa ban on Gadhafi and 15 other people tied to the regime 's crackdown . 
`` The massive violence against peaceful demonstrators shocks our conscience , '' EU High Representative Catherine Ashton said . 
`` It should also spring us into action . '' 
Over the weekend , Italy suspended a treaty with Libya that includes a non-aggression pact , helping to pave the way for possible military action by U.S. or NATO troops . 
Italy is home to the U.S. Navy 's Sixth Fleet . 
Kurt Volker , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , told CNN that Italy 's suspension of the pact would not immediately suffice for military actions to be launched from that country . 
The question , from the perspective of the Italian government , is `` if you 're really trying to think about military action , do you have some kind of authorization to do so ? '' 
he said in an interview . 
`` You would need a U.N. mandate and possibly a NATO declaration or both , and there is n't anything like that on the table at the moment . '' 
But , Volker said , others in the international community may soon have to decide whether to intervene militarily . 
`` At some point we have to face the question of are we willing to help them or not , '' he said . 
The situation in Libya differs from that of Egypt , where the United States was trying to balance various interests , Volker noted . 
`` We have no countervailing interests -LRB- here -RRB- . 
... -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- has been a terrible dictator . 
He was a terror plotter . 
He blew up the plane in Lockerbie . 
So we have no reason not to be helping the people of Libya get rid of this tyrant . '' 
Despite the growing international pressure , Gadhafi stood his ground Monday . 
Protesters fearful of violence stayed off the streets in Tripoli . 
Government officials warned that thousands of people could die if the popular uprising continues . 
The death toll from the unrest -- now in its 14th day -- has already topped 1,000 , according to a U.N. estimate . 
Clinton noted Monday that U.S. humanitarian teams have been dispatched to Libya 's borders at Tunisia and Egypt . 
Washington has set aside an additional $ 10 million for humanitarian aid , including medical supplies , she noted . 
CNN 's Tom Watkins , Lesa Jansen , Kelly Marshall Smoot and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report

2011-03-01,"By Ivan Watson and Moni Basu Thousands of Libyans seek safety Many of those fleeing are foreign workers in Libya A majority are Egyptians but there are also citizens of other nations Many do not have the means to return home The U.N. refugee agency fears problems with water , sanitation and shelter Along The Libya-Tunisia Border -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A green flag fluttering in the wind designated Libyan territory . 
A short distance away , a red flag flew for Tunisia . 
In between , a mass of humanity waited in no man 's land , desperate to flee escalating rebellion in one nation and cross into another that has already succeeded in toppling a dictator . 
Periodically , a ripple flowed through the crowd of thousands of refugees as men took turns passing forward dazed and unconscious travelers , overwhelmed by a treacherous journey to the border and exposure to the elements . 
Tunisian emergency workers rushed with fluorescent orange stretchers to evacuate the sick . 
Chaos reigned along Libya 's western border Tuesday as Tunisian police attempted to hold back a tide of people , mostly foreign workers caught in the storm of change blowing through the region . 
Libya evacuees have stories to tell A majority are Egyptians -- more than 1 million Egyptian citizens were working in neighboring Libya . 
But the fleeing foreigners also include citizens of Bangladesh , Thailand , Vietnam , Ghana , Sudan , Mali and other countries who traveled far from home in search of economic salvation . 
Now , many of them said they had everything stolen from them on the road to the border and are left with nothing but the clothes on their back . 
Gadhafi 's militia took my money , '' said Mohammad Ataye , an Egyptian who spent the last year working as a hairdresser in Libya . 
He was referring to troops still loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
Ataye said he tried to catch a flight out of Tripoli 's airport to Egypt , but was forced back by thousands of people waiting there . 
When he and a friend decided to make a run for the Tunisian border , Libyan soldiers robbed him of his savings and his two mobile phones on the way . 
Now what for the Egyptian refugee ? 
`` I do n't know . 
I do n't know , '' he said . 
Some of those fleeing Libya do not possess passports and other travel documents , which are often confiscated by the companies that employ them until their contracts are fulfilled , said Mathieu Luciano of the International Organization for Migration . 
Luciano , deployed to the Egyptian border town of Sallum to help shuttle people out , said his agency was working with the embassies of nations involved as well as the companies that hired the migrant workers to return them home safely . 
The agency is paying for a charter flight from Bangladesh that is scheduled to arrive later Tuesday . 
The Egyptian government has reported 69,000 people crossing into that nation . 
One of them is Mohamed Sohel . 
Sohel , who had been working for a Korean construction company in the eastern Libyan city of Durna for three years , was anxious to board a plane back home to Bangladesh . 
He said he has been surviving by sharing one piece of flatbread with two other men since arriving at the Egyptian border town of Sallum six days ago . 
His passport was locked up at the company 's Libyan headquarters in the western town of Misrata . 
`` We called the Bangladeshi embassy a thousand times , '' Sohel said . 
`` We never got any advice , or help . '' 
It 's easier for Egyptian workers to make it back home , Luciano said , but nonetheless , they face a difficult situation . 
They were the breadwinners , supporting families in rural Egypt . 
They are returning with no livelihood in a time of uncertainty in their own homeland . 
Some said they were frustrated with their interim military government for not doing more to help them . 
`` As we know , Egypt is also under a lot of stress now politically , '' said Hovig Etyemezian , a field officer with the U.N. refugee agency . 
`` So any country that is able to provide air lift or sea movement should pick up the ball so that more people leave , more Egyptians are able to go back to their country . '' 
On Libya 's border with Tunisia , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staff erected 500 tents . 
All of them are full . 
The global body appealed to member nations to help evacuate the stranded . 
`` The biggest priority is to take people out of the country , '' Etyemezian said . 
`` Now the -LRB- border -RRB- crossing is anywhere between 10 to 13,000 people a day . 
And the outgoing is 3 to 4,000 . 
So we need to have a bigger capacity of people leaving the country . '' 
Police and soldiers watched , as young Tunisian volunteers used sticks to beat back people trying to jump over a wall next to the border gate into Tunisia . 
Volunteers threw bread and bottles of water into the no man 's land between the red and green flags . 
Thousands of people have been waiting there for as many as three days , enduring bitter cold without shelter . 
Staff members with the U.N. refugee agency described the water and sanitation situation as precarious . 
Tunisian authorities told the agency that about 75,000 people have streamed into Tunisia . 
Up to 15,000 more people are expected to arrive Tuesday and the agency said it was `` becoming critically important that onwards transport becomes quickly available to avoid a humanitarian crisis . '' 
The refugee agency said it was particularly concerned about a large number of sub-Saharan Africans who are being denied entry into Tunisia . 
They may be targets for retribution after reports that embattled Gadhafi recruited mercenaries from those nations to suppress the uprising in his country . 
CNN 's Ivan Watson reported from the Libya-Tunisia border and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta .

Full Article SCENARIOS - Ivory Coast heading back towards civil war ? 
ABIDJAN\/DAKAR | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 5:29 pm IST ABIDJAN\/DAKAR -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Ivory Coast 's post-poll crisis is degenerating into armed conflict , with gun battles between forces loyal to presidential rivals erupting in the commercial capital Abidjan and the volatile west of the country . 
Incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo has defied international pressure to step down after U.N. certified poll results showed he lost an election that was meant to end years of stalemate following a 2002-3 civil war . 
His rival Alassane Ouattara is internationally recognized as president-elect of Ivory Coast but remains trapped in a lagoon-side hotel under siege by the pro-Gbagbo military , but forces siding with him have succeeded in seizing a town in the west and large swathes of an Abidjan neighborhood . 
Here are some possible scenarios in the weeks ahead : THE RETURN TO ALL-OUT WAR With daily AK-47 assault rifles and heavy weapons fire booming through Abidjan , and clashes erupting in various places across the country this week , a return to all out civil war is looking increasingly likely . 
Gbagbo still retains the public loyalty of the armed forces but , fearing a coup , is believed to have ensured that only his core elite forces have adequate access to the army 's weapons . 
U.N. accusations that Gbagbo has been seeking attack helicopters from Belarus further support fears of war . 
Both Belarus and Gbagbo 's government have denied the accusations . 
It is not clear whether Ouattara is ready to sanction a full-blown rebel advance , as it would taint his credibility if he came to power . 
Nor is it clear the rebels would succeed if they mounted any such offensive . 
But analysts say Gbagbo 's forces may be spread thin if clashes are opened up on enough fronts and he risks defections if losses within his ranks start building up -- as they seemed to do this week , with a number of deadly ambushes in Abidjan . 
A military source says increasing numbers of soldiers in the Ivorian military are deserting , by switching their phones off and going into hiding . 
A few are defecting to the other side . 
An unknown factor remains foreign mercenaries and Ivorian militia fighters that analysts say Gbagbo has on his payroll , although he needs money to pay them at a time when the financial noose is closing around him from sanctions and bank closures . 
A STALEMATE OF SPORADIC CLASHES Ivory Coast 's crises have a habit of fizzling into a slow burn neither war nor peace stalemate -- as has been the case since 2002-3 . 
In this scenario , no side makes much progress and the frontline does n't move much from the existing north-south one , with armed men on each side looting what they can from a rapidly shrinking economy . 
But previous such stalemates were possible because negotiations held out the hope of a resolution eventually . 
That now seems impossible since Gbagbo effectively tore up the peace process by refusing to accept the poll results . 
In this scenario , there would be a high likelihood of civilian unrest . 
This week saw pro-Gbagbo mobs attack Ouattara supporters and U.N. peacekeepers , after a call by Gbagbo 's youth leader to set up roadblocks and block their movements . 
AU PROPOSES A WAY OUT African presidents tasked with resolving the Ivorian crisis by proposing a `` binding solution '' have been given another month to complete what appears to be a Herculean task . 
Divisions emerged within the panel during their working visit to Abidjan , with Burkina Faso 's president and the head of ECOWAS objecting to the AU continuing with its trip despite threats against them by pro-Gbagbo supporters . 
Both sides have dug in so deep it is unclear what the AU might propose that would be palatable to both . 
An outside chance is talk that the AU could propose scrapping the Nov. 28 poll and holding a new one , potentially even with both Gbagbo and Ouattara ruled out and an outside force like Nigeria filling the security vacuum . 
This is unlikely to be popular in either camp but could be seen as the only way to break the deadlock . 
GBAGBO BOWS TO DEMANDS AND LEAVES Analysts see this as extremely unlikely unless his own life is in danger . 
Gbagbo has shown that he is more than willing to watch his country implode economically and head back to all out civil war if it will keep him in power . 
He has brushed off Western economic sanctions , bank closures and threats of force by West African regional bloc ECOWAS . 
He has also snubbed offers of a potentially lucrative soft landing in exile in the United States or South Africa . 
The killings of dozens of Ouattara supporters by pro-Gbagbo forces or allied militias in past weeks also create a strong disincentive for him to leave voluntarily , fearing reprisals or being tried for war crimes in the International Criminal Court . 
However , if the insurgency that is raging in Abidjan could attract enough army defectors to reach the gates of Gbagbo 's house , that might be more persuasive .

2011-03-01,"Mar 1 - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is warning that Libya could descend into civil war if Muammar Gaddafi refuses to quit . 
"
2011-03-01,"VALLETTA | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 9:39 am EST VALLETTA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Malta has refused to return two warplanes to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi that were flown to the Mediterranean island by defecting pilots last week , Maltese Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi said . 
Gonzi told reporters late on Monday that Libya 's prime minister had personally requested the return of the two Mirage jet fighters . 
Malta rejected the request and the fighters are still under armed guard at the airport . 
Their pilots have sought political asylum . 
Gonzi said a Libyan Arab Airlines flight which was denied landing permission at Malta on Tuesday last week had been carrying pilots sent to take the Mirages back . 
The prime minister told a news conference he had approved humanitarian missions to Libya from the island , which according to its constitution is neutral and non-aligned . 
Some 12,000 oil workers have been evacuated in a week by air and ferries to Malta , which has a population of just 410,000 . 
A rapid succession of flights is taking them on to their home countries . 
More evacuated workers arrived from Libya on Tuesday with a German-chartered ship bringing some 500 workers of many nationalities . 
The island had also been the departure point for rescue flights by the British Royal Air Force to pick up workers from the desert . 
The flights have been carried out without Libyan authorization . 
Gonzi said Malta was offering its service as a coordinating center for international humanitarian aid to Libya . 
A number of Maltese NGOs have already started public collections of food and medicines . 
Anti-Gaddafi protesters scrambled up the facade of the two-storey Libyan embassy in Valletta on Tuesday and raised the pre-Gaddafi Libyan flag . 
Libyan Ambassador Saadun Suayeh , who had earlier met the protesters , said he would accept any flag which represented the Libyan people . 
He said he intended to stay in his post but would meet Foreign Minister Tonio Borg . 
In media comments over the past two days , the ambassador has made a distinction between the Libyan people and the Libyan government and said the embassy represented all of Libya . 
However he also gave the Libyan official version of what was going on in his country .

2011-03-01,"U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gestures during a news conference after her speech at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva February 28 , 2011 . 
WASHINGTON | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 12:46 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya may become a peaceful democracy or face a drawn-out civil war , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday as she urged Congress not to cut funds she said were vital to deal with crises abroad . 
U.S. global leadership needs resolve and resources , Clinton told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee in the first of four congressional hearings this week where she will defend her budget against proposed Republican reductions . 
`` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos . 
The stakes are high , '' she said . 
`` The entire -LRB- Middle East -RRB- region is changing , and a strong and strategic American response will be essential . '' 
Libya , where Muammar Gaddafi is trying to crush a revolt , was an example of how Washington must use its resources to `` protect our interests and advance our values , '' she told the lawmakers , some of whom want to cut overseas spending . 
Clinton spoke a day after the United States began moving warships and aircraft closer to Libya , and froze $ 30 billion in assets , stepping up pressure on Gaddafi to give up power . 
`` We are taking no options off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to turn its guns on its own people , '' she said . 
Clinton has just returned from Geneva , where she discussed Libya with other governments outraged over Gaddafi 's violent attempt to put down the rebellion against his 41-year rule . 
No one expects any direct foreign military intervention in Libya for now , although there has been talk of a no-fly zone to prevent Libya 's air force from attacking protesters . 
U.S. officials say privately that there is little appetite for a no-fly zone . 
Separately , Clinton played down the idea of foreign forces helping opposition fighters to topple Gaddafi , saying `` they want this to have been their accomplishment . 
We respect that . '' 
Clinton testified to defend U.S. President Barack Obama 's $ 47 billion budget request -- up 1 percent from 2010 levels -- for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development , calling it a `` lean budget for lean times . '' 
Republicans , who took control of the House in November elections , have called for a tough new look at non-military overseas spending amid widespread calls to control the ballooning U.S. federal deficit . 
Clinton said Americans were justifiably concerned about the national debt but insisted they also wanted investments in the future , including diplomacy and aid to other countries . 
Retreating from international responsibilities often imposed long-term costs , she said , as happened in Afghanistan when the United States `` walked away '' after the Cold War ended and Soviet troops had gone home . 
`` We saved money in the short term . 
But those savings came at an unspeakable cost -- one we are still paying , 10 years later , in money and lives , '' she said , alluding to the rise of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . 
Representative Howard Berman , the committee 's top Democrat , called the Republican approach to cutting spending on diplomacy and development aid a `` slash and burn process . '' 
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , the Florida Republican who chairs the committee , largely rejected that argument . 
`` Those who complain about diminished levels of international affairs funding need to ask themselves : How much less would an insolvent United States of America be able to do ? ''

2011-03-01,"WASHINGTON | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 6:42 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Flexing its military muscle , the United States sent warships toward Libya on Tuesday as it sought to keep pressure on Muammar Gaddafi to relinquish his four-decade grip on power . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States and its NATO allies were still considering a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya , although military commanders warned of the peril to allied aircraft of enforcing it . 
The United States has also frozen $ 30 billion in Libyan assets . 
`` We are going to keep the pressure on Gaddafi until he steps down and allows the people of Libya to express themselves freely and determine their own future , '' Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , told ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' program . 
Two amphibious assault ships -- the USS Kearsarge , which can carry 2,000 Marines , and the USS Ponce -- were due to sail through the Suez Canal and enter the Mediterranean Sea early on Wednesday morning , an Egyptian official said . 
The repositioning of U.S. ships and aircraft closer to Libya is widely seen as a symbolic show of force since neither the United States nor its NATO allies have shown any appetite for direct military intervention in the turmoil that has seen Gaddafi lose control of large swaths of his country . 
U.S. officials said the ships were being redeployed in preparation for possible humanitarian efforts as tens of thousands of people flee the violence . 
But they said military action remained an option . 
`` We are looking at a lot of options and contingencies . 
No decisions have been made on any other actions , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said , noting the United Nations had not authorized the use of force in Libya . 
As of Tuesday , there were three U.S. ships in the Mediterranean -- two destroyers and the USS Mount Whitney , the command ship of the U.S. Sixth Fleet based in Gaeta , Italy . 
Gates declined to comment on reports the USS Enterprise , an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea , could be moved into the Mediterranean , a step that would significantly augment the U.S. military presence off Libya . 
Clinton warned of civil strife if Gaddafi , whose forces are trying to regain control of areas now in rebel hands , refused to step down . 
`` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos , '' she told U.S. lawmakers . 
Clinton also said U.S. authorities would look into claims that Gaddafi may have ordered the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie that killed 270 people . 
Libya accepted civil responsibility for the bombing in 2003 but Gaddafi has never been held to account . 
Rice said the United States would work to stabilize oil prices , which jumped to their highest in 21\/2 years on unrest in the oil-producing North African country . 
`` This ... does have potential implications for oil supply , oil prices , '' she said . 
Some Republican lawmakers have criticized the Obama administration 's initially cautious response to the Libyan crisis and pressed it to impose a no-fly zone . 
That would prevent Gaddafi from using his air force against the rebels , although analysts say the Libyan leader has been relying mainly on ground forces to attack opponents . 
Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said a no-fly zone would be a highly complex operation . 
`` If we were to set it up ... we 'd have to work our way through doing it in a safe manner and not put ourselves in jeopardy , '' he said . 
Libya 's Air Defense Command is estimated to have at least 216 surface-to-air missiles and 144 towed and 72 self-propelled missiles . 
But many analysts say much of Libya 's military equipment is poorly maintained or unusable , raising questions about what threat the anti-aircraft missiles would pose . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Plus , of course , the much mentioned no-fly zone .

The United States said it was moving ships and planes closer to the oil-producing North African state . 
The destroyer USS Barry moved through the Suez Canal on Monday and into the Mediterranean . 
Two amphibious assault ships , the USS Kearsarge , which can carry 2,000 Marines , and the USS Ponce , are in the Red Sea and are expected to go through the canal early on Wednesday . 
The White House said the ships were being redeployed in preparation for possible humanitarian efforts but stressed it `` was not taking any options off the table . '' 
`` We are looking at a lot of options and contingencies . 
No decisions have been made on any other actions , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said . 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe sounded a note of caution , saying military intervention would not happen without a clear United Nations mandate . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron said it was unacceptable that `` Colonel Gaddafi can be murdering his own people using airplanes and helicopter gunships . '' 
General James Mattis , commander of U.S. Central Command , told a Senate hearing that imposing a no-fly zone would be a `` challenging '' operation that would mean actual attack . 
`` You would have to remove air defense capability in order to establish a no-fly zone , so no illusions here , '' he said . 
`` It would be a military operation -- it would n't be just telling people not to fly airplanes . '' 
Analysts said Western leaders were in no mood to rush into conflict after the troubled , drawn-out involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
`` They will be desperate not to place themselves in that situation , unless not doing so would result in even worse massacres , '' said Shashank Joshi of London 's Royal United Services Institute . 
Suspicions grew that Gaddafi , a survivor of past coup attempts , did not grasp the scale of the forces against him . 
`` All my people love me , '' he told the ABC network and the BBC on Monday , dismissing the significance of a rebellion that has ended his control over much of oil-rich eastern Libya . 
Rebel fighters claimed the balance of the conflict was swinging their way . 
`` Our strength is growing and we are getting more weapons . 
We are attacking checkpoints , '' said Yousef Shagan , a spokesman in Zawiyah , only 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli . 
A rebel army officer in the eastern city of Ajdabiyah said rebel units were becoming more organised . 
`` All the military councils of Free Libya are meeting to form a unified military council to plan an attack on Gaddafi security units , militias and mercenaries , '' Captain Faris Zwei said . 
He said there were more than 10,000 volunteers in the city , plus defecting soldiers . 
Rebels guarding a munitions store said they feared a direct hit by Gaddafi 's warplanes could cause destruction for miles around . 
But Zwei said pilots appeared to be aiming to miss . 
`` We have complete confidence in the Libyan air force not to hit anything that affects their relatives in the east , '' he said . 
Despite the widespread collapse of Gaddafi 's writ , his forces were fighting back in some regions . 
A reporter on the Tunisian border saw Libyan troops reassert control at a crossing abandoned on Monday , and residents of Nalut , about 60 km -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- from the border , said they feared pro-Gaddafi forces were planning to recapture the town . 
Mohamed , a resident of rebel-held Misrata , told Reuters by phone : `` Symbols of Gaddafi 's regime have been swept away from the city . 
Only a -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- battalion remains at the city 's air base but they appear to be willing to negotiate safe exit out of the air base . 
We are not sure if this is genuine or just a trick to attack the city again . '' 
Across the country , tribal leaders , officials , military officers and army units have defected to the rebels . 
Sanctions will squeeze his access to funds . 
Tripoli is a clear Gaddafi stronghold , but even in the capital , loyalties are divided . 
Many on the streets on Tuesday expressed loyalty but a man who described himself as a military pilot said : `` One hundred percent of Libyans do n't like him . '' 
There were queues outside bread shops on Tuesday morning . 
Some residents said many shops were limiting the number of loaves customers could buy . 
The U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday unanimously suspended Libya 's membership of the U.N. Human Rights Council because of violence by Libyan forces against protesters . 
A U.N. Security Council resolution on Saturday called for a freeze on Gaddafi 's assets and a travel ban and refers his crackdown to the International Criminal Court . 
Libya 's National Oil Corporation said output had halved because of the departure of foreign workers . 
Brent crude prices surged above $ 116 a barrel as supply disruptions and the potential for more unrest in the Middle East and North Africa kept investors on edge . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
By not demanding immediate military assistance from outside forces to combat Gadhafi s helicopter gunships , tanks and other heavy weaponry is it the will of the Islamic hardliners in the Libyan opposition to sacrifice 100,000 Libyan citizens to Gadhafi s military machine so that these Islamic hardliners can impose their diabolical Religious Democracy upon the backs of Libyan citizens and thereby crush the Libyan revolution ? 
Local Libyan militias had better read the text of those demanding their weapons for they will be turned on them if they choose unwisely . 
Run with wolves be prepared to be devoured or worse to become a wolf . 
We should go public with a bona fide no-fly-zone offer ! 
Make that , Very Public , offer directly to the Libyan opposition leaders in Benghazi and elsewhere and , in addition , make it through a formal demand for a no fly zone in the UN Security Council and General Assembly . 
Immediate unilateral US action may or may not be necessary at the most current moment , but if thousands of Libyans citizens are killed by Qaddhfi , let it NOT be said that it was for lack of a genuine effort by the US . 
A flight of F-15s coming in fast and low over his troops will put an end to this . 
All they want is a paycheck , and they are n't willing to fight hard to get one .

2011-03-01,"ZAWIYAH , Libya | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 1:33 pm EST ZAWIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels holding a port city near the Libyan capital are launching counter-attacks against government forces massing in the area , but food in the encircled town is running short . 
Armed with tanks , anti-aircraft guns mounted on pick-up trucks and automatic rifles , the rebels in the strategic city of Zawiyah said they had repelled several attacks in past days by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi trying to retake the city . 
The road between Tripoli and Zawiyah , which is about 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- long , was blocked by at least 12 checkpoints , most of them reinforced with tanks , when Reuters reporters drove through the area on Tuesday . 
At least eight Russian-designed truck-mounted Grad rocket launchers were deployed about 20 km east of Zawiyah . 
The rebels , who appear to control only the central part of the city , said their forces had started launching attacks on army checkpoints encroaching on the town . 
`` Our strength is growing and we are getting more weapons . 
We are attacking checkpoints , '' said Yousef Shagan , a resistance spokesman . 
Asked if more attacks were planned , he added : `` We plan to attack checkpoints to send them away . '' 
In one incident late on Monday , he said three government soldiers were killed in skirmishes with rebel forces . 
A Libyan government spokesman said 10 soldiers were killed . 
The government says it is not using military force to retake rebel-held cities . 
However , one official did not rule out using force on Monday if all other options were exhausted . 
In central Zawiyah , where the red , green and black flags of the anti-Gaddafi revolt flew from government buildings , protesters said roadblocks around the city were disrupting food and medicine supplies . 
`` The situation is really bad . 
We are isolated , we can not get food supplies , '' said Ibrahim Klami , a human rights lawyer who has joined the rebellion in Zawiyah . 
`` We need human rights organizations to help us . 
There is little food and milk for babies . 
... Gaddafi is trying to hide this . 
The city is no longer controlled by Gaddafi . '' 
On the outskirts of the city , life appeared to be more tranquil . 
Shops were open and herds of sheep were grazing in lush fields dotted with yellow daffodils . 
But in the central square , barricaded against the rest of the city with blocks of concrete and palm tree trunks , a tank and several operational anti-aircraft guns were a testament to the rebels ' determination to fight on . 
A crowd chanted `` Gaddafi you madman '' and `` Down with the dictator '' and fired shots into the air . 
The entire front of a building facing the square was painted in opposition colors . 
Some , clutching their Kalashnikovs , were reclining inside military-style tents pitched over heaps of colorful carpets . 
`` This is how we win . 
Our victory is near , '' said one young man , Haitham . 
`` We have weapons and people 's support . ''

2011-03-01,"AJDABIYAH , Libya | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 4:00 pm EST AJDABIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Leaders of the rebel forces holding eastern Libya are forming an army of volunteers and defectors and will advance on Tripoli once it is liberated from within , a rebel army officer said on Tuesday . 
Captain Faris Zwei , among military officers in the east who had joined the opposition to Muammar Gaddafi , told Reuters there were more than 10,000 volunteers in Ajdabiyah , about 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- from the capital which was still held by forces loyal to the Libyan leader . 
`` We are reorganising the army , which was almost completely destroyed by Gaddafi and his gang before they left , '' he said . 
`` We are reforming , as much as we can , the army from the youth that took part in the revolution . '' 
He added : `` We 're currently waiting for Tripoli to free itself , and we will give them time to have this honor . '' 
Zwei declined to give a figure for the number of troops who had defected but said all forces were under the aegis of a newly formed military council encompassing all rebel-held areas . 
`` In Ajdabiya , we have more than 10,000 volunteers , not including official soldiers , '' he said . 
Other military officials have said they needed to train volunteer recruits first before making a push west . 
The officers and other witnesses reported that an air force plane bombed close to a munitions store near Ajdabiyah on Monday . 
The aircraft returned to attack the Haniyeh base a second time , striking close to a storage bunker inside the walls , they said . 
`` There was bombing here last night , but nothing was hit , '' said Jumah Sayed , one of the civilians who had volunteered to guard the base . 
`` If one of these bunkers were hit , everything would be destroyed for miles around . '' 
Stacked floor to ceiling in bunkers at the site were crates of missiles , rockets , mortar rounds and other munitions of all calibres , orange dust lying thick on the crate lids . 
Zwei , whose base was less than a kilometre from Haniyeh , said he was sure the air force pilots were missing their targets deliberately . 
`` We have complete confidence in the Libyan air force not to hit anything that affects their relatives in the east . 
And we see it with bombing away from targets . 
This is proof they have honor , '' he said . 
Last week , two Libyan pilots flew their fighter planes to Malta and defected , rather than attack anti-Gaddafi forces . 
The United States said on Monday it was moving ships and planes closer to the country and Prime Minister David Cameron has said his government was working on preparation for the declaration of a `` no-fly '' zone to protect the Libyan people . 
Volunteers guarding Haniyeh , some carrying Kalashniknovs and rocket launchers , said they did not know how to use heavy weaponry at the site . 
Few of them appeared to be professional soldiers . 
The base comprises 35 bunkers . 
Three bunkers were seen by Reuters , as well as an adjoining hangar which a military expert said was packed with thousands of tonnes of munitions . 
Most of it appeared in good order , although many boxes had a manufacture date from the 1970s . 
"
2011-03-01,"LONDON | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 7:40 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - On paper , Libya 's military has some 100,000 troops , more than 2,000 tanks , 374 aircraft and a navy and includes two patrol submarines . 
What Colonel Muammar Gaddafi actually has left to call on is a different matter . 
Here are some details of Libya 's armed forces , officially totaling around 76,000 active personnel , plus a reserve or people 's militia of some 40,000 . 
GROUND FORCES - STRENGTH ON PAPER : Numbers : 50,000 including 25,000 conscripts . 
Main Battle Tanks - 2,205 , including 180 T-90S and 200 T-62 . 
The rest are in store . 
Armored personnel carriers - 945 . 
Even before the uprising , Libya 's military strength was seen as having been seriously undermined by sanctions and neglect although Western powers had just began to sell it weapons again . 
Much of the equipment is seen as poorly maintained or unusable , leaving it hard to estimate genuine numbers . 
Analysts say Gaddafi tried to emasculate the regular army to avoid the emergence of commanders who might rival his immediate family , relying instead particularly on three loyal `` regime protection '' units often of his own tribe . 
That leaves him with what most estimate to be some 10-12 ,000 loyal Libyan troops . 
The most reliable formation is seen to be the 32nd Brigade commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis . 
Repeated reports from witnesses , rights groups and others talk of African mercenaries flown in by Gaddafi to help strengthen his government . 
Exact numbers are impossible to obtain . 
In Libya 's east around the city of Benghazi , regular military forces appear to have either defected to the opposition or melted away . 
Citizens groups also appear to have taken arms . 
But analysts say the opposition lacks much in the way of command and control or even any form of centralized leadership . 
So far , opposition units have focused primarily on defending territory and have shown little appetite to advance . 
That leaves loyalist forces trying to stem protest and perhaps regain lost territory in Libya 's west around Tripoli . 
The key coastal city of Sirte between Tripoli and Benghazi is still under government control and the east effectively lost . 
But experts warn the situation remains fluid . 
`` We underestimate the degree of loyalty in the security forces , '' warns Shashank Joshi , Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute . 
`` The defections appear to be patchwork and possibly along tribal lines . 
The units that matter , such as Khamis 's 32nd Brigade , are holding together . 
NAVY - STRENGTH ON PAPER Submarines - 2 patrol submarines . 
Libya 's two surviving Foxtrot class diesel submarines were delivered by the Soviet Union in the late 1980s , but outside experts have long questioned their reliability . 
According to IHS Jane 's , in 2003 one was reported to be in dry dock and one was sea going -- although unlikely to be fully operational . 
It suggested both might already have been abandoned . 
AIR FORCE - STRENGTH ON PAPER Combat capable aircraft - 374 . 
227 fighter aircraft -- 13-Mirage F1-ED , 94 MiG-25 , 75 MiG-23 and 45 MiG-21 . 
Helicopters - 85 Support helicopters Analysts estimate many of Libya 's fast jets are in fact no longer airworthy . 
Gaddafi has so far also lost at least three aircraft in the course of this uprising with two jets defecting to Malta and the crew of a third ejecting over the desert rather than bomb opposition targets as ordered . 
Occasional reports have also spoken of the use of helicopter gunships , fuelling calls for foreign powers to impose a no-fly zone . 
There are also Air Defense Command forces which possess at least 216 surface-to-air missiles and 144 towed and 72 self propelled missiles . 
Again , maintenance may be an issue . 
Most analysts believe Libya 's armed forces would not be able to seriously threaten outside air forces attempting to enforce a no-fly zone , saying Gaddafi 's defense capabilities probably lag behind those of Iraq 's Saddam Hussein before the US-led 2003 invasion . 
The BBC reported a British RAF Hercules transport aircraft evacuating foreign nationals came under small arms fire this week but was not seriously damaged . 
Some suggested the attack might have come from opposition forces who mistook the plane for one of Gaddafi 's aircraft on a bombing raid . 
According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -LRB- OPCW -RRB- , Libya destroyed its entire stockpile of chemical weapons munitions in early 2004 as part of a rapprochement with the West that also saw it abandon a nuclear program . 
The OPCW told Reuters Libya did retain some 9.5 tons of deadly mustard gas at a secret desert location but no longer had the capability to deliver it .

2011-03-01,"\* Clinton : `` strategic American response will be essential '' \* Defends `` lean budget for lean times '' and urges no cuts \* Short-term savings can lead to big costs later - Clinton WASHINGTON , March 1 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya could become a peaceful democracy or face a drawn-out civil war , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday , urging U.S. lawmakers not to cut funds needed to deal with crises abroad . 
American global leadership needs both resolve and resources , Clinton told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee . 
`` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos . 
The stakes are high , '' she said . 
`` The entire -LRB- Middle East -RRB- region is changing , and a strong and strategic American response will be essential . '' 
The turmoil in Libya , where Muammar Gaddafi is trying to crush a revolt , was an example of how Washington had to use its diplomatic and defense assets as well as development aid to `` protect our interests and advance our values , '' she told the lawmakers , some of whom want to cut overseas spending . 
Clinton spoke a day after the United States began moving warships and aircraft closer to Libya , and froze $ 30 billion in assets , steeping up pressure on Gaddafi to give up power . 
The U.S. Agency for International Development is sending two humanitarian teams to the region to help provide food and medicine to Libyans fleeing into Tunisia and Egypt . 
`` We are taking no options off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to turn its guns on its own people , '' she said . 
Clinton has just returned from Geneva , where she discussed Libya with other governments outraged over Gadaffi 's violent attempt to put down the rebellion against his 41-year rule . 
Clinton was invited to testify to the House panel in defense of President Barack Obama 's $ 47 billion budget request for the State Department and the USAID . 
That is up 1 percent from 2010 levels . 
Clinton called it a `` lean budget for lean times . '' 
Republicans , who took control of the House in November elections , have called for a tough new look at non-military overseas spending amid widespread calls to control the ballooning U.S. federal deficit . 
Clinton said Americans were justifiably concerned about the national debt but insisted they also wanted investments in the future , including diplomacy and aid to other countries . 
Retreating from international responsibilities often imposed long-term costs , she said , as happened in Afghanistan when the United States `` walked away '' after the Cold War ended and Soviet troops had gone home . 
`` We saved money in the short term . 
But those savings came at an unspeakable cost -- one we are still paying , 10 years later , in money and lives , '' she said . 
Obama has proposed spending almost $ 110 billion in 2012 on Afghanistan , where he has pledged to begin withdrawing the first of about 100,000 U.S. troops fighting Taliban insurgents by the middle of this year . 
Of this amount , about $ 107 billion is military spending . 
The State Department , mounting its own civilian `` surge '' aimed at stabilizing Afghanistan , would spend an extra $ 2.2 billion there as it seeks to increase assistance programs . 
`` Retreating from our civilian surge in Afghanistan -- with our troops still in the field -- would be a grave mistake , '' Clinton said . 
She said U.S. aid to Pakistan was `` equally important . '' 
Obama proposes maintaining significant aid to Pakistan to arm , train and equip its military to fight extremists with about $ 1.1 billion earmarked for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund , roughly the same level as last year . 
The Obama administration is launching its requests for the 2012 budget at a time when spending for 2011 is still not approved by Congress . 
Clinton said the 16 percent cut to the State Department and USAID included in a House-passed spending bill for 2011 last month would be `` devastating to our national security . ''

2011-03-01,"NEW YORK | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 4:04 pm EST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Gold rose more than 1 percent to an all-time high on Tuesday above $ 1,432 an ounce as chaos in Libya and political turmoil in the Arab world prompted safe-haven buying and soaring oil prices boosted bullion 's inflation hedge appeal . 
Unrest across the Middle East and North Africa , which unseated leaders in Tunisia and Egypt before spreading across Libya , Bahrain , Yemen and Iran , fueled a 6 percent rise in gold prices in February . 
`` What gold needed was a catalyst , and it found it in the form of tensions that are surfacing in the Middle East and rising oil prices , which served as an inflationary threat and also led to political instability , '' said Mark Luschini , chief investment strategist of Janney Montgomery Scott , a brokerage that manages $ 53 billion in client assets . 
On Tuesday , Iranian security forces fired teargas and clashed with anti-government demonstrators protesting the treatment of opposition leaders . 
The United States said Libya could descend into civil war if Muammar Gaddafi refuses to quit , after word of unspecified Western military preparations . 
Gold has rallied strongly since political unrest sent U.S. light sweet oil futures soaring nearly $ 3 to just under $ 100 a barrel on Tuesday , driven by worries about supply disruptions . 
Wall Street lost over 1 percent as oil 's surge fanned concerns about a dampening effect on economic growth . 
Spot gold rallied to a record of $ 1,432.10 an ounce , surpassing its previous record of $ 1,430.95 set on December 7 . 
The metal gained 1.4 percent to $ 1,430.69 an ounce by 2:50 p.m. EST -LRB- 1950 GMT -RRB- , its largest one-day gain since January . 
U.S. April gold futures settled up 1.5 percent at $ 1,431.2 an ounce , with volume about 10 percent lower than its 30-day average and in line with lower-than-usual recent turnover . 
Bullion rose 6 percent in February , its largest monthly rise since August . 
It traded mostly sideways last week , then gained on Tuesday on resurgent safe-haven bids . 
Silver hit a fresh 31-year high at $ 34.59 an ounce and later climbed 2 percent to $ 34.46 . 
Silver has risen about 11 percent this year . 
The gold-silver ratio , which shows how many ounces of silver it takes to buy one ounce of gold , approached a 13-year low . 
Silver has risen amid limited supplies for near-term delivery and on prospects of rising demand for industrial metals as the economy recovers . 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the recent surge in oil prices was unlikely to have a big impact on the U.S. economy , but could dampen growth and raise inflation if sustained . 
Bernanke 's comments boosted gold as he offered no hint that the U.S. central bank was considering winding down its loose monetary policy , which also sent the U.S. dollar to a 3-1\/2 month low against major currencies . 
`` From the start of crude oil 's ascent based on Libya , you are seeing general risk issues become more of a front burner in peoples ' psyche , '' said James Dailey , portfolio manager of the TEAM Asset Strategy Fund . 
O -RRB- `` You 've had the U.S. long-term Treasuries rally . 
You 've had a lot of the things that traditionally occur when people start to get afraid , all except the U.S. dollar rally , '' Dailey said . 
Since the Fed cut interest rates to 0.25 percent in response to the global financial crisis in late 2008 , gold has risen 70 percent . 
In a reflection of investor ambiguity toward gold at record prices , bullion held by SPDR Gold Trust , the world 's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund , fell a fifth consecutive month in February , marking its worst string of declines since the creation of the fund in 2004 . 
Platinum group metals investors took heart from news that U.S. auto sales rose more than 20 percent in February as the lure of discounts from automakers outweighed concerns about higher oil prices . 
Platinum gained 1.8 percent to $ 1,837 an ounce , while palladium climbed 2.5 percent to $ 814.22 an ounce .

2011-03-01,"AJDABIYAH , Libya | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 10:34 am EST AJDABIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyans guarding a major munitions store near the rebel-held eastern town of Ajdabiyah fear a direct hit by warplanes sent by Muammar Gaddafi 's military could cause destruction for miles around . 
A warplane bombed just outside the walls of the Haniyeh base on Monday before returning to attack again , striking close to a storage bunker inside the walls , according to an officer at the site who has joined the opposition to the Libyan leader . 
Military officers and other witnesses confirmed on Tuesday that the attack had taken place after the accuracy of the report was questioned . 
The United States said on Monday it was moving ships and planes closer to the country , and British Prime Minister David Cameron has said his government is working work to prepare a `` no-fly '' zone to protect the Libyan people . 
`` There was bombing here last night , but nothing was hit , '' said Jumah Sayed , one of the civilians who had volunteered to guard the base . 
`` If one of these bunkers were hit , everything would be destroyed for miles around . '' 
Mohammed Yusuf , the officer , said anti-aircraft guns were fired at the raiding warplane . 
Then at around 9 p.m. , defenders heard a helicopter . 
`` We attacked with anti-aircraft fire and it left without bombing anything , '' he told Reuters at the site . 
Another aircraft was heard at around 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday , added Saad Mahmoud , another officer who defected from Gaddafi 's military during a revolt that has put much of the Libya under rebel control . 
`` We fired randomly in the air and it left , '' he said . 
The rebels said the bomb which struck inside the walls of the base had landed in a minefield , making it impossible to independently check the blast site . 
The base comprises 35 bunkers . 
This correspondent was given access to one which a military expert said was packed with at least 10,000 tonnes of munitions of every caliber . 
Five tanks were also visible at the base . 
The rebels said they do not have weapons to fire the heavy caliber ammunition .

2011-03-01,"RAS JDIR , Tunisia | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 2:10 pm EST RAS JDIR , Tunisia -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Soldiers fired into the air in an effort to subdue a wave of Egyptian laborers desperate to escape Libya on Tuesday , as the refugee crisis created by the rebellion against Muammar Gaddafi escalated . 
Aid workers threw bottles of water and loaves of bread over the wall to a sea of men surging forward toward the safety of Tunisian soil , in a futile attempt to calm them . 
Young Tunisians with branches torn from the trees kept them from clambering over the wall between border posts . 
Tunisian officials were processing entrants as fast as they could , as medics plucked fainting men from the heaving mass sweeping over the chest-high steel gate . 
Panicking migrants passed their bulging suitcases , rugs , and blankets overhead at the gate where soldiers with sticks tried to hold them back . 
A Tunisian officer with a loud hailer shouted reassurances that they would be let in . 
Order looked close to collapse at one brief point in the overflowing border compound on the Tunisian side , where throngs of men jostled and long lines of exhausted migrants in torn jackets and headcloths queued for water , food , and toilets . 
Troops fired warning shots in the air and white-faced officers unholstered their automatic pistols . 
Many tens of thousands more are expected to flee west from the violence that has consumed Liby as Gaddafi 's regime teeters on the verge of collapse . 
`` We ca n't see beyond that building on the Libyan side but we think there are many more waiting to come through , '' said Ayman Gharaibeh , team leader for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- at Ras Jdir . 
`` The numbers are daunting , '' he said . 
The last couple of days had seen an upsurge and refugees were now crossing at a rate of up to 15,000 a day , he said . 
There was no one to coordinate relief and establish order on the Libyan side and the UNHCR judged it was not safe to go over there . 
Medecins sans Frontieres and the Red Cross-Red Crescent were trying to liaise with the Libyans to slow the flow . 
`` It looks like it 's going to get worse ... They are going to break down the wall in the end , '' said Gharaibeh grimly . 
In the mass of people behind the wall on the Libyan side , Bangladeshis held up a sheet with the words : `` Help Help Help . '' 
In the Tunisian compound , a few hundred Vietnamese squatted stoically , waiting their turn to be bussed out and home . 
About 70,000 refugees had entered Tunisia since the uprising began in Libya and only an estimated 20 percent had been repatriated , the UNHCR team-leader said . 
Tunisia 's capacity to feed , shelter and provide sanitation for the destitute workers is being pushed to breaking point . 
The UN agency built a transit camp of hundreds of white tents overnight about 7 km -LRB- 4 miles -RRB- back from the border , with the capacity to provide temporary relief for up to 20,000 . 
`` When are we going to be taken out of here ? 
We can not accept this , '' said one Egyptian . 
`` Give me a camel . 
I will take a camel . 
I just want to go home . '' 
Evacuation flights were picking up refugees from Djerba airport in the plush beach resort area in the north of Tunisia , a world away from the chaos . 
Ships have taken boatloads away from the port of Zarzis but not nearly fast enough to ease the pressure , said Tunisian army Colonel Mohamed Essoussi . 
`` We need the most rapid possible evacuation , '' he said . 
`` The major weaknesses are in transport , air and maritime transport . '' 
The emergency shelters and transit camp could handle 5,000 a day , he said . 
`` We are now feeding 17,000 people . '' 
International aid agencies at the scene agreed with the assessment . 
Tunisia 's capacity to shelter the flow was at its limit . 
They said faster evacuation was needed and control on the Libyan side would greatly ease the crisis . 
However , there appeared to be almost no one with the power and authority to achieve order there , the UNHCR said . 
Thousands have no money to pay for their passage home , and no employer responsible for their repatriation . 
Many have been sleeping out in the open for days in cold , wet conditions . 
As the sun went down and rain clouds approached , campfires flickered under a grove of trees at the border , where hundreds of refugees huddled in shelters built of their baggage , under blankets and plastic sheeting .

2011-03-02,"By Nic Robertson , CNN senior international correspondent Is opposition waning in Tripoli ? 
Until the leadership is overthrown , then Tripoli is where the tipping point will need to happen It appears at the moment that both sides are heading for a stalemate If talks can progress in rebel-controlled Zawia and Misrata it could provide incentive for other areas The government is feeling international and domestic pressure but it is also a diehard leadership Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In Libya , the rivals for power appear to be heading towards a stalemate . 
CNN 's Nic Robertson explains what 's happening in the capital , Tripoli , why two cities in rebel control could be key to the country 's future , and why neither side has the power to dislodge the other completely . 
What 's it like on the streets of Tripoli ? 
We have seen about three rings of security around the capital . 
They include Army checkpoints with armored personnel carriers , anti-aircraft batteries and tanks . 
But there are not that many soldiers around and they do n't stop many vehicles . 
They are more interested in vehicles coming into the city than those leaving it . 
On the streets in the outskirts where we know there have been anti-government protests we saw some police in armored vehicles and riot gear . 
But we are talking about a couple of dozen at any one location . 
At street intersections there might be a couple of soldiers or police armed with automatic weapons but it is not a complete lockdown of every street . 
The traffic passes through and they are not stopping people . 
How willing are people to talk to you ? 
Fuel truck causes blasts in Tripoli Quiet but not normal in Tripoli For rebels , a long road to Tripoli Some people , as soon as they see the camera , they come up and tell us how much they love Gadhafi but if you engage in conversation you can scratch the surface and they will tell you they want reforms . 
Often you hear the chant or people saying `` miya miya '' which means they are 100 percent for Gadhafi . 
Others may not want to share their opinions but it is clear they are not happy with the situation or the government . 
Yet others are brave to explain their positions . 
One man who came up to me took me into his confidence . 
He said they had tried anti-government protests and thought they were doing well , but now they 've been so badly beaten and forced off the streets that they are afraid to come out again . 
Is Gadhafi 's message resonating with Libyans ? 
There is an uneducated population that will go with their tribe . 
If the tribe says `` go with Gadhafi '' then they support Gadhafi . 
Government officials will tell you a good part of the population will follow the tribe . 
It is not a developed society . 
It 's tribal and basic and people are not taught to analyze for themselves . 
When you speak to the more middle class people they take it with more of a pinch of salt . 
But a lot of these people are worried by how the protests developed . 
I talked to a lawyer who said he protested the regime but when he saw weapons in the hands of protesters he felt the protest was being hijacked . 
These people have a lot at stake -- their kids ' education , their businesses or professional reputations . 
They are worried that violent protests threaten stability . 
They want change but do not want it through violent means . 
There were others , intellectuals among them , who think they have to really pressure the regime to make the change . 
Can the protesters in other parts of the country affect what happens in Tripoli ? 
Protesters in Benghazi can come out on the streets but it will not change anything in Tripoli . 
Until the leadership is overthrown in Tripoli , then Tripoli is where the tipping point will need to happen . 
But they can make a difference by organizing politically to either negotiate with the government or to build international pressure . 
And they can organize militarily to move forces and try to take the capital . 
But that is not going to happen anytime soon . 
In a place like Zawia the center is controlled by the opposition but they are surrounded by government forces . 
The more they engage the military the more it stretches the government but it does not appear they are doing that . 
We are in a stand off . 
There is no pressure point where the opposition can push through . 
What do the options seem to be at the moment for how this will play out ? 
The government says it wants to negotiate . 
I do not think the government can get away with wholesale bloodshed to retake parts of the country . 
I am not sure that they have enough loyal military to mobilize against the opposition . 
The government does not have the strength to breakout from where it is . 
And the opposition does not have the strength to tip the balance at the moment . 
I think a key test will be in Zawia , west of Tripoli , and Misrata , east of Tripoli . 
We are told the government is trying to negotiate with the rebels in these areas . 
If they can negotiate then they may be able to be productive with rebels elsewhere . 
But I do n't think it will come together in the next few days . 
The situation can not go on for much longer but it could still be a few weeks . 
A senior government official told me dealing with the opposition is `` chaotic . '' 
The opposition is divided . 
There are the protest leaders and former government ministers who have just resigned and swapped sides . 
It is possible the government is reaching out to the former government elements . 
There is no effective process for any sort of dialogue . 
I think the government here does not quite know what to do . 
It is still on the back foot . 
The government is feeling international and domestic pressure but it is also a diehard leadership .

2011-03-02,"From Jill Dougherty and Elise Labott , CNN Obama doing enough to pressure Gadhafi ? 
A delegation of U.S. House members visits the Libyan Embassy Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration is considering whether it should cut diplomatic ties with Libya , a senior U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday . 
`` Whether to maintain relations or sever them is under review , '' the official said . 
Cutting ties would send a strong message that the United States no longer considers the government of Moammar Gadhafi to be legitimate . 
President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both said in recent days that Gadhafi has lost his legitimacy to rule the Libyan people and should leave power . 
According to the senior U.S. official , the last high-level communication with Gadhafi 's government was last week , when Clinton spoke with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa . 
Mass Libya exodus creates border chaos Fuel truck causes blasts in Tripoli U.S. preps Libyan humanitarian effort Who makes money from Libyan oil ? 
However , the official also said there was `` still some utility '' in reserving channels of communication with the Gadhafi government , noting that some American citizens remain in Libya and there could be a need to talk to Libyan officials about humanitarian activity . 
`` There may be instructions one has to give to Libya depending on what happens going forward , '' the official said . 
The official added that the United States still considered Ali Aujali to be the legitimate Libyan ambassador to the United States , even after the Gadhafi regime notified Washington that Aujali no longer represented its interests . 
Last week , Aujali said he no longer represented the regime because of Gadhafi 's brutal repression against the Libyan people . 
But he said he still represented the Libyan people and told the State Department he would remain a liaison to the Libyan opposition . 
On Monday , the State Department received a fax from the Libyan government saying Aujali was no longer the ambassador and it had named the deputy ambassador as the new `` charge d'affaires , '' spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters . 
The senior U.S. official said the fax from Libya was not an official diplomatic note and until State Department lawyers review its authenticity , `` Ambassador Aujali continues to be the head of mission at this time . '' 
At the Libyan Embassy on Tuesday , Aujali greeted a delegation of U.S. House members led by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas who came for a visit as a few dozen anti-Gadhafi protesters chanted on the street . 
Afterwards , Jackson Lee said she and her colleagues would try to ensure that the U.S. government continues to recognize Aujali to be `` the representative of the Libyan people . '' 
She praised Aujali for condemning the Gadhafi regime , saying that , `` In jeopardy of his life , he has been willing to stand with those who fight . '' 
Aujali asked for support from the United States . 
`` Please stand with us to change this regime , to stop the killing of the Libyan people which is taking place every day , '' he said , later adding : `` This regime is a brutal regime . 
The slogan of the regime is , ' I rule you or I kill you . ' '' 
As Jackson Lee 's delegation prepared to get in vehicles to leave , they were surrounded by demonstrators who wanted to shake their hands and hug them . 
We stand with the people of Libya , '' Jackson Lee repeated over and over amid a barrage of embraces .

2011-03-02,"U.S. Navy moves closer to Libya Libya 's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dabbashi on Gadhafi : `` No one loves him '' It 's not clear who the opposition leaders are U.S. weighing whether to cut diplomatic ties with Libya Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- International efforts to persuade Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to step down ratcheted up Tuesday , as world leaders moved against him on financial and political fronts , strengthened their rhetoric and moved military might into the region . 
`` We have joined the Libyan people in demanding that Gadhafi must go -- now , without further violence or delay -- and we are working to translate the world 's outrage into action and results , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the House Foreign Affairs Committee . 
The Obama administration is considering whether it should cut diplomatic ties with Libya , a senior U.S. official told CNN . 
`` Whether to maintain relations or sever them is under review , '' the official said . 
U.S. officials have said all options are being considered with respect to Libya . 
Underscoring that point , the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge and the amphibious transport dock USS Ponce were to be repositioned in the Mediterranean to `` provide us a capability for both emergency evacuations and also for humanitarian relief , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters . 
But , he noted , the U.N. Security Council has not authorized the use of armed force . 
The U.N. General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution to suspend Libya from its seat on the 47-member chamber Human Rights Council . 
It was the first time the assembly had suspended a member of the council . 
`` This is a harsh rebuke -- but one that Libya 's leaders have brought down upon themselves , '' said Ambassador Susan E. Rice , U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations , in a statement . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly that he welcomed the decision and urged the international community to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Libya . 
`` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . 
`` We demand an immediate end to the violence toward civilians and full respect for their fundamental human rights , including those of peaceful assembly and free speech . '' 
Should U.S. arm Libyan rebels ? 
U.N. fears refugee crisis in Libya Guns and oil in rebel controlled Libya Libyan protests : Raw and online He added that reports from the ground `` are sobering , '' with continuing loss of life and ongoing repression . 
`` Arms depots and arsenals have reportedly been opened to gangs who terrorize communities , '' he said . 
`` There are reports that government forces have fired indiscriminately on peaceful protesters and bombed the military bases in the east of the country . '' 
`` The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown , but likely to exceed 1,000 , '' with thousands more wounded , Ban said , using the same fatality figure he had used Friday . 
Libya 's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that the death toll was about 2,000 . 
But Gates stressed the number of casualties is uncertain . 
`` I think the honest answer is that we do n't know , '' he told reporters . 
The government of Canada has frozen $ 2.3 billion in assets tied to the Libyan government ; the assets were frozen after Canada enacted sanctions over the weekend , Canadian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Lynn Meahan said Tuesday . 
A number of other countries , including the United States , have ordered an asset freeze . 
Though some witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air , Gates and Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said they could not confirm the reports . 
What are U.S. options for Libya ? 
Clinton said imposition of a no-fly zone is under consideration , but Mullen said doing so would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' 
A top U.S. general said Tuesday that any effort to establish a no-fly zone over the country would include eliminating Libya 's air defenses . 
It would be `` challenging , '' U.S. Central Command leader Gen. James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services committee . 
In western Libya , Ban said , there were reports of ongoing clashes between government forces and armed opponents . 
He noted `` allegations of extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions and torture . '' 
Though more members of the military have reportedly sided with the opposition , Gadhafi 's supporters `` appear to be holding a tight grip on western parts of the country , chiefly Tripoli , '' he said . 
He warned of `` serious indications '' that the numbers of refugees and displaced persons were reaching crisis proportions and worried that the violence could disrupt distribution networks and lead to food shortages . 
The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya 's borders into Egypt and Tunisia and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders . 
Ban called for immediate action by the international community . 
`` Time is of the essence , '' he said . 
`` Thousands of lives are at stake . '' 
Indeed , at the border with Tunisia , many recent arrivals said they had been robbed or forced to pay bribes en route . 
Some said they had been threatened with death . 
One man said Libyan soldiers used electric cables to beat him as he waited at the airport and demanded $ 500 from him . 
When he told them he did n't have it , they said , `` Die then '' and threw him into the street . 
Tunisian authorities appeared to be struggling to cope with the arriving wave of refugees . 
Volunteers hurled fresh bread and water into the crowds . 
`` There is nothing for them on that side , '' a policeman turned volunteer said from the Tunisian side of the border . 
He was one of many Tunisians donating their time to take food , water and supplies to the border . 
Many said they were livid that international organizations were slow in arriving . 
Meanwhile , more parts of the regime have broken off , joining calls for Gadhafi to halt the violence . 
In London , the Libyan Embassy said it was siding with the opposition , condemning what it called `` all acts of murder and terror '' taking place in Libya . 
The military situation on the ground was complex : Forces loyal to Gadhafi tried to retake a town near the capital that is under opposition control but were repelled , an opposition leader in the town told CNN Tuesday . 
The source said pro-Gadhafi troops with tanks and anti-aircraft guns attacked Zawiya from east and west at nightfall Monday , but did not capture the town . 
A senior official in Gadhafi 's regime denied that government forces attacked rebels in Zawiya . 
Senior members of the government told CNN that Zawiya and Misrata are key to their effort to regain control of the country . 
The officials insisted they want a peaceful resolution , but witnesses have described repeated violent efforts by the regime to regain control of areas Gadhafi has lost . 
Zawiya was calm Tuesday , but Gadhafi 's troops remained nearby , the opposition leader and another source in the town said . 
CNN is not naming them to protect their safety . 
Misrata was protected by its residents and military defectors and the situation there on Tuesday was stable , said Abd al Baset Imzeereq , who identified himself as the spokesman for the newly formed city council . 
Pro-Gadhafi forces are stationed in the Navy college about 15 kilometers -LRB- nine miles -RRB- outside the city and have not attempted to move into the city center since its fall , he said . 
The forces appear to be stationed there not to try to retake the city , but to protect the ammunition depot in the college and `` to terrorize the people '' by opening fire on them . 
At least two farmers were killed Monday when these forces shot at their vehicle , Imzeereq said . 
Still , some semblance of normalcy was visible Tuesday , when some banks had reopened in Misrata and people were able to withdraw money or get loans , he said . 
Food supplies were ample , he said , but medical goods were scarce . 
Imzeereq said at least 33 have been killed and another 487 wounded in Misrata since the unrest began . 
The capital city of Tripoli was quiet Tuesday as more people here also tried to resume normal life . 
Prices of basic goods have increased ; a Tripoli resident said she could not get paid due to unspecified problems in her bank . 
Some residents told CNN they want to protest but fear being killed . 
Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the leader 's 38-year-old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests , told CNN his talks with the opposition are in `` chaos '' because the opposition is divided , with no clear leaders . 
Many Libyans have rejected the younger Gadhafi 's remarks during the uprising . 
But U.S. officials made similar comments about the rebel forces . 
A U.S. official who wished to remain nameless because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it 's `` unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult '' for the U.S. to provide assistance . 
`` The intelligence community is aggressively pursing information on the ground , '' said the official , who added that the CIA has had a presence in the country for some time . 
`` I think it remains to be seen how effectively military leaders who have defected from Gadhafi 's forces can organize the opposition in the country , '' said Gates . 
`` We are watching that unfold . '' 
Over the past two weeks , government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators and rebel forces , fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets , numerous witnesses have told CNN . 
The elder Gadhafi made no public appearances Tuesday , but he appeared out of touch on Monday , denying having used force against his people and even denying the existence of the protests . 
`` No demonstration at all in the streets , '' the 68-year-old ruler told ABC and the BBC in a joint interview in Tripoli . 
`` They love me , all my people with me , they love me all . 
They will die to protect me , my people , '' said Gadhafi , who has controlled Libya for nearly 42 years . 
But Libya 's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi disagreed . 
`` I do n't believe that even his family loves him at this moment , '' said Dabbashi , who has joined the rebel movement in calling for Gadhafi to step down . 
`` I think no one loves him at all . 
I think the whole Libyan people hate him now . 
With all the bloodshed , all the killing ... he 's certainly out of his mind . ''

2011-03-02,"WASHINGTON | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 12:06 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Setting up a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya would require an attack to cripple its air defenses , the defense secretary said on Wednesday , as the United States intensified pressure on Muammar Gaddafi to step down . 
`` Let 's just call a spade a spade . 
A no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses ... and then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates told a congressional hearing . 
The United States is moving several amphibious assault ships to the Mediterranean as the United States and other nations seek to force a defiant Gaddafi to end his 41-year rule in the face of an uprising by fragmented groups of rebels . 
Western nations have also been considering a no-fly zone . 
While the Obama administration says all options are on the table , Washington may be reluctant to initiate military action as it grapples with the financial and human costs of two long , bloody wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Gates said a no-fly zone for Libya `` also requires more airplanes than you can find on a single aircraft carrier , so it is a big operation in a big country . ''

This is another war . 
More billions added to the trillion we are already blowing in the Middle East . 
Who cares who runs these countries ? 
We have no friends in the region anyway . 
Figures I have seen say that the biggest sales of military stuff to Libya is from Russia , which seems to be exporting `` defensive '' X. ??? air defense systems that supposedly `` clear the air '' of manned fighters , and cruise and ballistic missiles . 
F15s , F16s , F18s etc are probably `` design objectives '' . 
Just my speculation as a non-mil techo nerd , but Gates needs to be listened to by the `` mad dog '' American and Israeli right wingers . 
I actually feel sympathy for the American who joined the National Guard militia for a bit of extra money , and `` home defense '' , and is now conscripted to garrison some hostile patch of the planet to satisfy some political poseur sponsored by some investors in death and suffering .

2011-03-02,"TRIPOLI | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 8:17 am EST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi , facing calls to step down after a bloody crackdown threatening his 41-year rule , blamed al Qaeda cells on Wednesday for creating turmoil and said there was a conspiracy to control Libya and its oil . 
Gaddafi , who said no more than 150 people were killed in the unrest caused by `` terrorists , '' told a loyal audience in an address shown on state television that if the United States or foreign powers entered Libya they would face a bloody war . 
The Libyan leader said he was willing to discuss constitutional and legal change without arms or chaos and was ready to talk with al Qaeda if they had demands . 
`` There is a conspiracy to control the Libyan oil and to control the Libyan land , to colonize Libya once again , '' he said . 
`` This is impossible , impossible . 
We will fight until the last man and last woman to defend Libya from east to west , north to south , '' Gaddafi told his supporters who punctuated the address with cheers of support and declarations of loyalty . 
`` You will remain great ! '' 
chanted the crowd to Gaddafi , who was full of confidence and vigor but apparently in denial about swathes of Libya occupied by anti-Gaddafi rebels . 
`` We will enter a bloody war and thousands and thousands of Libyans will die if the United States enters or NATO enters '' Gaddafi said . 
On the sequence of events that started the unrest , Gaddafi , who in a previous speech said protesters against his rule were brain-washed by Osama bin Laden and had their milk and Nescafe spiked with hallucinogenic drugs , said : `` How did that all begin ? 
Small , sleeper al Qaeda cells . '' 
Wearing long , white robes , a brown head-dress and gesticulating , Gaddafi said : `` Al Qaeda 's cells attacked security forces and took over their weapons ... After Bayda , the Qaeda cells moved to Benghazi and Derna . '' 
Gaddafi , 68 , said there were no protests against his rule in Libya and that `` underground groups '' were whipping people up and reports by the media to the contrary were wrong . 
There were no political prisoners in Libya , he said . 
The international community should set up a fact-finding committee to find out just how many people had been killed in the Libyan unrest and accusations against Libya , he said . 
`` I dare you to find that peaceful protesters were killed . 
in America , France , and everywhere , if people attacked military storage depots and tried to steal weapons , they will shoot them , '' Gaddafi said . 
The world did not understand the Libyan system that puts power in the hands of the people , Gaddafi said . 
`` Muammar Gaddafi is not a president to resign , he does not even have a parliament to dissolve , '' he said at the celebration to mark the declaration of Libya as a Jamahiriya in 1977 . 
`` We put our fingers in the eyes of those who doubt that Libya is ruled by anyone other than its people , '' he said , referring to his system of `` direct democracy '' which he outlines in his famous Green Book . 
`` The Libyan system is a system of the people and no one can go against the authority of the people ... The people are free to chose the authority they see fit , '' Gaddafi said . 
`` I am not in a seat to resign from it , by asking me to resign , they are doubting the accomplishment of the people . 
Libya is ruled by the people , '' Gaddafi said . 
At one point during the address , a woman in black robes and a green scarf seized a microphone and shouted : `` How can you go ? 
You will not go and you will never leave ! 
You are all that is good ! 
You are a sword that does n't bend . '' 
Gaddafi told the excited supporters : `` Calm down youths . '' 
On media coverage of the uprising , Gaddafi said : `` News reached the world from stations and agencies that did not have correspondents in Libya , unfortunately ... Libyans do not like foreign correspondents , '' he said . 
The images came from inside a hall with long , red curtains and Gaddafi moved through the hall before sitting on a podium in front of the clapping gathering . 
He joined them in singing the national anthem .

Full Article U.S. warns of civil war in Libya unless Gaddafi goes A Libyan army tank guards a traffic intersection near a mural adulating leader Muammar Gaddafi in the Tripoli suburb of Gaser Ben Ghisher March 1 , 2011 . 
TRIPOLI | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 12:27 am IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya could descend into civil war unless Muammar Gaddafi quits , the United States said on Tuesday , its demand for his departure intensifying pressure on the longtime leader after news of Western military preparations . 
But Gaddafi remained defiant , dispatching forces to a western border area amid fears that the most violent Arab revolt may grow bloodier and spark a humanitarian crisis . 
His son , Saif al-Islam , warned the West against launching any military action to topple Gaddafi , and said the veteran ruler would not step down or go into exile . 
`` Using force against Libya is not acceptable . 
There 's no reason , but if they want ... we are ready , we are not afraid , '' he told Sky television , adding : `` We live here , we die here . '' 
In Moscow , a Kremlin source suggested Gaddafi , whose authority has unravelled in much of the vast desert country , should step down , calling him a `` living political corpse '' . 
In prepared testimony to U.S. lawmakers in Washington , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said : `` Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war . '' 
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , said Washington would apply pressure on Gaddafi until he bows out , working to stabilise oil prices and avert a humanitarian crisis . 
She stopped short of saying the Obama administration was ready to impose a no-fly zone over Libya that would prevent Gaddafi using aircraft against rebels fighting against him . 
On Monday the United States said it was moving ships and planes closer to the oil-producing North African state . 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe sounded a note of caution , saying foreign military intervention in Libya would not happen without a clear United Nations mandate . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron said it was unacceptable that `` Colonel Gaddafi can be murdering his own people using airplanes and helicopter gunships . '' 
General James Mattis , commander of U.S. Central Command , told a Senate hearing that imposing a no-fly zone would be a `` challenging '' operation that would mean actual attack . 
`` You would have to remove air defense capability in order to establish a no-fly zone , so no illusions here , '' he said . 
`` It would be a military operation -- it would n't be just telling people not to fly airplanes . '' 
Analysts said Western leaders are in no mood to rush into conflict after the troubled , drawn-out involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
`` They will be desperate not to place themselves in that situation , unless not doing so would result in even worse massacres , '' said Shashank Joshi of London 's Royal United Services Institute . 
Suspicions grew that Gaddafi , a survivor of past coup attempts , did not grasp the scale of the forces against him . 
`` All my people love me , '' he told the U.S. ABC network and the BBC on Monday , dismissing the significance of a rebellion that has ended his control over much of oil-rich eastern Libya . 
Rebel fighters claimed the balance of the conflict was swinging their way . 
`` Our strength is growing and we are getting more weapons . 
We are attacking checkpoints , '' said Yousef Shagan , a spokesman in Zawiyah , only 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli . 
A rebel army officer in the eastern city of Ajdabiyah said rebel units were becoming more organised . 
`` All the military councils of Free Libya are meeting to form a unified military council to plan an attack on Gaddafi security units , militias and mercenaries , '' Captain Faris Zwei said . 
But despite the widespread collapse of Gaddafi 's writ , his forces were fighting back in some regions . 
A reporter on the Tunisian border saw Libyan troops reassert control at a crossing that was abandoned on Monday , and residents of Nalut , about 60 km -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- from the border , said pro-Gaddafi forces deployed to retake control there . 
Mohamed , a resident of rebel-held Misrata , told Reuters by phone : `` Symbols of Gaddafi 's regime have been swept away from the city . 
Only a -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- battalion remains at the city 's air base but they appear to be willing to negotiate safe exit out of the air base . 
We are not sure if this is genuine or just a trick to attack the city again . '' 
Tripoli is Gaddafi 's last stronghold . 
Tribal leaders , officials , military officers and army units have defected to the rebels . 
Sanctions will squeeze his access to funds . 
Around the Libyan capital there were queues outside bread shops on Tuesday morning . 
Some residents said many shops were limiting the number of loaves customers could buy . 
`` The situation is nervous , '' said Salah , a doctor . 
`` Of course I am worried . 
My family is afraid . 
They are waiting at home . 
We have been hearing gunfire . '' 
A Tripoli resident said the main state television station , Jamahiriya , was no longer available on its usual satellite channel . 
He said Libiya , another of Libya 's three television stations , which are all state controlled , had told viewers Jamahiriya 's signal was being subjected to interference . 
It was not clear if the interference was linked to a campaign , led by Libyan exile groups , to persuade satellite television operators to stop carrying Libyan television . 
In the opposition bastion of Benghazi , residents said food and other necessities were in good supply . 
In Geneva , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called on world powers to fully implement a U.N. Security Council resolution on Libya . 
The text , adopted on Saturday , includes a freeze on Muammar Gaddafi 's assets and travel ban and refers his regime 's brutal crackdown to the International Criminal Court . 
Libya 's National Oil Corporation said output had halved because of the departure of foreign workers . 
Brent crude prices pushed back above $ 114 a barrel as supply disruptions and the potential for more unrest in the Middle East and North Africa kept investors on edge . 
At Ras Jdir on the border with Tunisia , Tunisian border guards fired into the air to try to control a crowd of people clamouring to get through a frontier crossing to escape the violence in Libya . 
About 70,000 people have passed through the Ras Jdir frontier crossing in the past two weeks , and in the last few days the rate has increased to up to 15,000 per day , said Ayman Gharaibeh , an officer with the U.N. refugee agency . 
Revolutions in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt have helped to ignite resentment of four decades of often bloody political repression under Gaddafi as well as his failure to use Libyan oil wealth to tackle widespread poverty and lack of opportunity .

2011-03-02,"TUNIS | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 12:20 pm EST TUNIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Food stocks are depleted and supply chains disrupted in Libya , the United Nations ' World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- said on Wednesday , calling for urgent humanitarian aid to the country hit by political unrest . 
Responding to the critical situation in North Africa , the WFP is launching a $ 39 million emergency operation to provide food assistance to 2.7 million people in Libya , Egypt and Tunisia , it said in a statement . 
`` We call for safe humanitarian access , especially to western Libya , '' WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said in a statement , after visiting the Libyan-Tunisian border on Tuesday . 
`` Cutting off food supplies must not be used as a weapon , '' she said . 
Under its contingency plans , the WFP has re-routed shipments of wheat and flour to the Tunisian border and the Libyan port of Benghazi . 
`` We are planning for a three-month emergency operation that will help shore up Egyptian and Tunisian food safety nets and will also purchase food from the region to help ensure that recovery from the disruption can begin immediately , '' she said . 
Thousands of migrant workers desperate to leave Libya are stranded at the border with Tunisia , sleeping in the open and getting little if any assistance . 
Meanwhile , WFP says it is also worried about the food situation within the country . 
`` People arriving at the crossing are reporting that food availability varies from town to town . 
Food is scarce in some parts of the country , '' WFP spokeswoman Abeer Etefa said by phone from the border . 
Food shortages were reported in Zawiyah , a city 50 km west of Tripoli held by rebels but surrounded by pro-Gaddafi forces , where some refugees said the price of bread had gone up 20 percent . 
Libya relies on imports for over 90 percent of its food . 
`` It 's clear that the turmoil and the fact that roads are not safe are putting pressure on food supplies , '' Etefa said . 
The WFP dispatched a team to Benghazi on Wednesday to check if the port was safe for food deliveries and inspect the food supply situation there .

2011-03-02,"WASHINGTON | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 4:21 pm GMT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - An unpublished U.S. diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks tells the previously undisclosed story of how an American corporate powerhouse -- the $ 35-billion -LRB- 21 billion pounds -RRB- Coca-Cola Co. -LRB- KO . 
N -RRB- -- got caught up in a fierce fraternal dispute between two of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's sons . 
The contretemps among the freres Gaddafi over a local bottling plant escalated into a heavily armed confrontation resembling a Hollywood gangster film , as a classified 2006 U.S. cable put it . 
`` You know the movie ` The Godfather ' ? 
We 've been living it for the last few months , '' a businessman involved in the dispute was quoted in the cable as telling an official from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Tripoli . 
The cable , which was made available to Reuters by a third party , centres on a bottling plant in Tripoli that was shut down for three months . 
It had been seized by troops loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , a son of Muammar , who at the time was feuding with one of his brothers , Mohammed . 
-LRB- Another State Department cable suggests a third Gaddafi son , Saadi -- better known as the family 's professional soccer player -- may also have been involved in the squabble , though no details of his role are given . -RRB- 
Eventually , the American diplomatic mission in Tripoli , known then as the U.S. Liaison Office , sent a firm protest to the Libyan government . 
The document states that around the same time , Mohammed Gaddafi , possibly under pressure from his sister Aisha , a family peacemaker , apparently agreed that shares owned by the Libyan Olympic Committee , which he led , would be sold to a third party . 
Shortly afterward , the cable says , Mutassim 's men left the Coke plant , ending the family standoff , but not before employees of the plant received threats of bodily harm and a Gaddafi cousin was stuffed in the trunk of a car . 
The Coca-Cola confrontation is among numerous tales about endless squabbling within the Gaddafi clan recounted in State Department cables . 
Among other things , the incident underlines the difficulties faced by foreign companies operating in Libya even after the U.S. and United Nations began to scale back sanctions following Muammar Gaddafi 's decision in late 2003 to abandon his nuclear weapons program . 
A spokesman for Coca-Cola acknowledged there had been `` some uncertainty '' surrounding Coke distribution arrangements in Libya during the period described in the cable . 
But the problem was `` resolved amicably '' by the end of 2006 , the spokesman said , and since then , Coca-Cola had been operating normally in Libya until the onset of the current unrest . 
A spokesman for the State Department said : `` We will decline to comment on any particular cable . 
The U.S. has taken aggressive action in recent days to freeze the assets of the Qaddafi family . 
Thus far , more than $ 30 billion in assets have been blocked . '' 
WORKERS THREATENED , PLANT MATERIALS DESTROYED Back when Libya was isolated by economic sanctions , its Coca-Cola supply was limited to consignments of the beverage bottled at a plant in Tunisia and transported to Tripoli and Benghazi . 
After U.S. and international trade embargoes on Libya began to ease , the Tripoli plant was established . 
It was co-owned by what the cable describes as a British company called Ka'Mur -- whose name was a reference to two embargo-era Libyan soft-drinks -- and by the Libyan Olympic Committee , headed by Mohammed Gaddafi . 
Immediately after this joint venture was set up , the State Department cable says , the embargo-era Libyan distributor of bottled Coke sued the group behind the newly-opened plant , alleging breach of contract . 
A complaint was also sent to Coca Cola International alleging that the bottling plant operators had `` stolen the franchise '' from the previous distributors , according to the cable . 
The bottling plant operators counter-sued . 
Then , on December 28 , 2005 -- two weeks after the Tripoli plant began turning out locally-bottled batches of Coke -- `` two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility , asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant , '' according to an account of the incident a businessman gave to U.S. diplomats . 
The U.S. mission in Libya learned from other sources that the troops were loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , who , after the Coca-Cola dispute was resolved , was named Libya 's national security adviser . 
According to the State Department cable , Mutassim bore a grudge against his brother because he had `` taken over '' the embargo-era domestic soft-drink business in the late 1990s when Mutassim had been exiled to Egypt for `` insubordination '' against their father . 
-LRB- Another cable says the `` rumor '' was that Mutassim had been linked to a coup attempt . -RRB-

2011-03-02,"BREGA , Libya | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 6:43 pm EST BREGA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels repulsed a land and air offensive by Muammar Gaddafi 's forces on Wednesday as the defiant leader warned foreign powers of `` another Vietnam '' if they intervened . 
The U.S. government is already cautious about the prospect of imposing a `` no-fly zone '' over Libya , stressing the diplomatic and military risks involved , but has nevertheless moved two amphibious assault ships into the Mediterranean . 
Rebels in their eastern bastion of Benghazi have called for U.N.-backed air strikes to halt attacks by African mercenaries they say Gaddafi is using against his own people . 
Government troops , backed by air power , launched a dawn attack on Wednesday and briefly captured Brega , an oil export terminal 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . 
But opposition forces counter-attacked and took back the town they held for about a week , rebel officers said . 
They were ready to move west toward the capital , they said , if Gaddafi refuses to quit . 
Basking in the adulation of loyalists in Tripoli , Libya 's leader for the last 41 years , launched into a tirade against the `` armed gangsters '' he said were behind the unrest , part of a conspiracy to colonize Libya and seize its oil . 
`` We will enter a bloody war and thousands and thousands of Libyans will die if the United States enters or NATO enters , '' Gaddafi told Tripoli supporters at a gathering televised live . 
`` We are ready to hand out weapons to a million , or 2 million or 3 million , and another Vietnam will begin . 
It does n't matter to us . 
We no longer care about anything . '' 
Further bombing raids struck near the oil terminal in the afternoon . 
Estimates of the death toll during the day ranged between five and 14 . 
Oil prices surged to near recent 2-1\/2 year highs due to fears the unrest could spread to other OPEC producers . 
Gaddafi , who once said ballot box democracy was for donkeys , told the gathering in Tripoli the world did not understand he had given power to the people long ago . 
`` We put our fingers in the eyes of those who doubt that Libya is ruled by anyone other than its people , '' he said , referring to his system of `` direct democracy '' launched at a meeting attended by visiting Cuban leader Fidel Castro in 1977 . 
A Tripoli resident and Gaddafi opponent , who did not want to be identified , told Reuters afterwards : `` Gaddafi will hang on for a while . 
It 's not going to be easy for an unarmed crowd to face highly armed forces eager to shoot their own people . '' 
The assault on Brega appeared to be the most significant military operation by Gaddafi since the uprising erupted in mid-February and set off a confrontation that Washington says could descend into a long civil war unless Gaddafi steps down . 
Witnesses said the attack was backed by heavy weapons and air strikes . 
One of the witnesses said Gaddafi 's forces were 2-3 km from the city center and had 300-350 rebels pinned down at an oil industry airport on the city outskirts . 
Hisham Mohammed , a 33-year-old mechanic on the side of the rebels , was defiant . 
`` I 'm going to Brega to help our brothers there . 
I 'm washed , I 've prayed , and I 'm ready to go to God , '' he told Reuters . 
Analysts cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from fast moving events in a situation of erratic communications . 
`` The attack reinforces the idea that the government is capable of projecting power far into the east , '' said Shashank Joshi , an analyst at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute . 
`` But we should keep in mind that both the government and the rebels are trying to spin an image of momentum . '' 
In Benghazi , the rebel National Libyan Council called for air strikes . 
`` We call for specific attacks on strongholds of these mercenaries , '' said council spokesman Hafiz Ghoga . 
`` The presence of any foreign forces on Libyan soil is strongly opposed . 
There is a big difference between this and strategic air strikes . '' 
In a possible response to Western hints that the opposition needs to unify to facilitate rebel links with outside powers , Ghoga added that a former justice minister , Mustafa Abdel , Jalil , would be chairman of the Council which will have 30 members and be based in Benghazi before moving later to Tripoli . 
Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , one of the first Libyan diplomats to denounce leader Muammar Gaddafi and defect , said the U.N. may back a resolution for a no-fly zone if the National Libyan Council officially requested it . 
Any sort of foreign military involvement in Arab countries is a sensitive topic for Western nations uncomfortably aware that Iraq suffered years of bloodletting and al Qaeda violence after a 2003 U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein . 
The Arab League said it was against direct outside military intervention , but could enforce a no-fly zone over Libya in cooperation with the African Union . 
Realistically though , only the United States could carry out such an operation . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said U.S. military assets could be used to support the movement of supplies to areas in need but a no-fly zone was not an immediate priority . 
`` I think we are a long way from making that decision , '' Clinton told a Senate hearing . 
`` There is a great deal of caution that is being exercised with respect to any action we might take other than in support of humanitarian missions . '' 
Two U.S. amphibious assault ships , the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ponce , passed through Egypt 's Suez Canal and arrived in the Mediterranean on Wednesday . 
The White House said the ships were being redeployed in preparation for possible humanitarian efforts but stressed it `` was not taking any options off the table . '' 
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said : `` Our job is to give the president the broadest possible decision space . '' 
But he said that enforcing a no-fly zone meant first attacking and destroying Libyan air defenses . 
`` A no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses ... Then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down , '' Gates told a congressional hearing . 
The uprising , the bloodiest yet against long-serving rulers in the Middle East , is causing a humanitarian crisis , especially on the Tunisian border where thousands of foreign workers are trying to flee to safety . 
At Ras Jdir on the Tunisia border , thousands of Bangladeshi migrant workers , desperate to leave Libya , pressed up against the gates of the frontier crossing , angry at their government for sending no help . 
Groups of West African migrant workers also in the crowd chanted for help and held up the flags of Ghana and Nigeria . 
About 70,000 people have passed through the Ras Jdir border post in the past two weeks , and many more of the hundreds of thousands of foreign workers in Libya are expected to follow .

Full Article India struggles with Libya evacuation , concerns mount NEW DELHI | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 3:06 pm IST NEW DELHI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - India 's government is facing criticism at home for failing to evacuate citizens swiftly out of Libya as China did , but it said such a comparison was unfair . 
A quarter of about 18,000 Indians , most of them employed in the oil , construction and health sectors in Libya , have been brought out after the government chartered cruise ships , and through special flights of the state carrier Air India . 
China , meanwhile , evacuated 32,000 of its citizens in an operation involving four heavy-lift IL-76 military aircraft , chartered aircraft and a navy frigate . 
The United States has already completed evacuation operations , with the last Americans flying out of the besieged capital Tripoli on Friday . 
`` We are not in competition with China here . 
We 're focused on the task of bringing back our people safe and sound . 
Please let 's not devalue this , '' Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao said in a tweet as concerns increased about the fate of Indians stranded in the North African country . 
The United States said Libya could sink into civil war unless long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi quits amid fears that the uprising , the bloodiest against long-serving rulers in the Middle East , could cause a humanitarian crisis . 
The Indian navy has sent three ships to help in the evacuation but they will take a week to reach Libya . 
A Defense Ministry official said the air force was on stand-by to deploy IL-76 aircraft to rescue Indians stranded in the interior of Libya , but it would need overflight clearance from a host of countries . 
`` Out of Libya India crawls , the rest are safe at home , '' the Indian Express said , adding India remained the only major country with thousands of nationals stranded there . 
On Tuesday , Indian Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna spoke to his Libyan counterpart , Moussa Koussa , seeking help to evacuate Indians . 
The Indian Foreign Ministry said in a statement it was looking at setting up air bridges with the cities of Sirte in the east and Sebha in the south to fly citizens out . 
The government has also turned to private Indian air carriers to run flights to Tunisia and Cairo to pick up citizens who had landed there fleeing the turmoil in Libya .

2011-03-02,"CAIRO | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 7:54 am EST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Libya crisis is an internal Arab affair and foreign powers should refrain from any intervention , Iraq 's foreign minister said at meeting of the Arab League , which has suspended Muammar Gaddafi 's government . 
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari , in opening remarks to an Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo on Wednesday , said the Libyan leadership must make brave decisions to stop violence and respect the `` legitimate rights '' of the people . 
The Cairo-based Arab League has suspended Libya 's participation in condemnation of a violent crackdown by Gaddafi forces against protests that have grown into a rebellion against his rule . 
Zebari called on the ministers to stand in silence in memory of Arabs killed in a wave of pro-reform protests that have swept the leaders of Egypt and Tunisia from power and are challenging the rule of others in Bahrain and Yemen , as well as Libya . 
`` We hope the Libyan people can overcome these difficult conditions , and that the Libyan leaders take brave stands to stop bloodshed and respect the legitimate desires and rights of its people to live in a free , democratic nation , '' Zebari said . 
He said the Arabs confirmed their `` desire for no foreign intervention '' in Libya , whose seat stood empty at the Cairo meeting . 
A draft resolution drawn up by Arab League representatives on Tuesday stated the Arabs ' rejection of `` any foreign military intervention in Libya '' and stressed `` the unity and integrity of Libyan soil . '' 
The foreign minister of Oman , one of the states where protesters have been challenging their rulers , said Wednesday 's meeting was the first of a `` new Arab renaissance . '' 
Speaking about the Arab nation , Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah said `` nobody should interfere in her affairs . '' 
The United States has sent warships toward Libya and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the country and its NATO allies are still considering a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya , though Western states appear hesitant to stage an intervention . 
Amr Moussa , the Arab League 's secretary general , did not mention the prospect of foreign intervention in his opening remarks to the meeting . 
`` The situation in Libya is sorrowful and it is not correct that we accept it or live with it , '' said Moussa , who intends to run for the Egyptian presidency from which Hosni Mubarak was toppled on February 11 . 
`` The reality is the Libyan people are suffering greatly and facing violations and attempts to assassinate its desire for freedom , '' he said . 
Libya 's Arab League representative is one of the Libyan diplomats around the world who have deserted Gaddafi 's administration . 
The Libyan delegation has renounced links to Gaddafi , saying it now represented the will of the people and condemned `` the heinous crimes against unarmed citizens . ''

Full Article ANALYSIS - Could Libya war crimes talk just entrench Gaddafi ? 
LONDON | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 6:54 pm IST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Foreign powers hope threatening Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi with a war crimes trial at The Hague will help drive him from office , but some worry such talk might instead leave him thinking he has no way out . 
The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to refer Libya to the International Criminal Court following its crackdown on protesters . 
ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said on Monday attacks on civilians could be a crime against humanity and warranted a full investigation . 
But -- just as with previous ICC probes into Congolese warlords , Sudan 's president and Uganda 's Lord 's Resistance Army -- there is the lingering worry that prosecutions will make compromise and finding a solution harder . 
Part of the problem , experts say , is that there is simply no real way to know what impact the threat will have on Libya 's always somewhat erratic leader . 
`` It 's a difficult balancing act , '' said Alia Brahimi , a research fellow on North Africa at the London School of Economics . 
`` There is a risk that taking an absolute moral and legalistic approach and talking about war crimes charges simply reinforces Gaddafi 's idea that he has nowhere else to go and no option to step down . 
But on the flip side , it sends a strong message to those around him . '' 
Homegrown amnesty , truth and reconciliation processes -- rather than international prosecutions -- have been key to the resolution of several political crises or conflicts once thought intractable , such as the conflict between South Africa 's white apartheid rulers and the black majority . 
Many also doubt Northern Ireland 's decades of violence could have been brought hopefully to a close if Britain had still been looking to prosecute sometime IRA militants . 
A week into Libya 's uprising , the country is effectively divided between Gaddafi loyalist and opposition forces in what some fear could be the opening stages of a civil war . 
Foreign governments say hundreds if not thousands have been killed already , while aid agencies fear a humanitarian crisis . 
Outside powers demand that Gaddafi stand down , threatening no-fly zones , sanctions and possibly further military action -- although critics say that can also back intransigent rulers into a corner . 
But the foreign powers say the risk of war crimes charges should deter followers from attacking civilians and might help prompt his ouster . 
`` International prosecutions can sometimes carry risks , such as causing brutal dictators to entrench rather than step down and face justice , '' said Matthew Waxman , professor at Columbia Law School and fellow at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations . 
`` However , -LRB- they -RRB- can also help isolate perpetrators ... hastening their demise while also laying the foundation for longer term stability and serving broader interests in justice and deterrence . '' 
It is possible any war crimes prosecution could still be halted in its tracks if foreign powers chose to do so . 
Interviewed by Reuters in 2005 shortly before the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the head of Uganda 's LRA leader Joseph Kony , prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo said he might in general agree to halting proceedings in a country if that would bring peace . 
Some in Uganda and elsewhere had warned that issuing warrants against the LRA for child abduction and killing might make it impossible to reach an agreement with them . 
Kony ultimately refused to sign a peace deal after talks hosted by South Sudan , some say because he feared ICC prosecution . 
He and his fighters fled into nearby Congo and are still at large , continuing to raid villages there and in Sudan . 
But Human Rights Watch 's head of the international justice program , Richard Dicker , said it was now barely even legally possible to simply cancel proceedings . 
`` The world has changed with the passing of the Rome Statute , '' he said , referring to the 2002 treaty establishing the ICC . 
`` There 's just not the legal option to offer ... to stop the legal process . 
The option of letting Gaddafi walk away without any legal consequences just is n't on the table any more . '' 
In reality , international justice remains likely to be highly selective . 
Any one of the permanent five UN Security Council members of the U.S. , Britain , France , Russia or China can effectively block a probe . 
That means Chinese actions in Tibet and elsewhere , Russian clampdowns in Chechnya or alleged Western abuses in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay are all off the agenda . 
Close friends of Security Council powers such as U.S. ally Israel or China 's friends Myanmar or Sri Lanka also tend to enjoy more diplomatic cover . 
`` It 's a far from perfect system ... an uneven playing field , '' said Human Rights Watch 's Dicker . 
`` But I believe ... we are moving in the right direction . 
If you look at eastern Congo , you have warlords who have been given amnesty time and time again ... in a short-term search for peace . 
They have returned to commit even more vicious atrocities . 
You have to have systems that will bring justice . '' 
Others say that -- like the threat of economic sanctions or military action -- at the end of the day the prosecution threat may simply become another diplomatic bargaining chip . 
`` A war crimes indictment demonstrates the resolve of the international community , '' said Thomas Barnett , chief analyst of political risk consultancy Wikistrat . 
`` To the extent that it pushes an embattled leader into a corner , it can likewise be retracted as part of the collective bargaining for an acceptable exit scenario for the leader , his family and top associates . ''

Full Article U.S. warships move through Suez , Gaddafi defiant TRIPOLI | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 3:32 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Two U.S. warships were passing through the Suez Canal on their way to waters off Libya on Wednesday as Western nations exerted diplomatic and military pressure on Muammar Gaddafi to step down . 
The United States said Libya could sink into civil war unless the Libyan leader ends his four-decade rule amid fears that the uprising , the bloodiest yet against long-serving rulers in the Middle East , could cause a humanitarian crisis . 
Gaddafi is defiant and his son , Saif al-Islam , has warned the West against launching military action . 
He said the veteran ruler would not relinquish power or be driven into exile . 
Across Libya , tribal leaders , officials , military officers and army units have defected to the rebel cause and say they are becoming more organised . 
Tripoli is a stronghold for Gaddafi in this oil-producing north African state . 
`` We are going to keep the pressure on Gaddafi until he steps down and allows the people of Libya to express themselves freely and determine their own future , '' Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , told ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' . 
Captain Faris Zwei , among officers in the east who joined the opposition to Gaddafi , said there were more than 10,000 volunteers in Ajdabiyah , 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- from the capital . 
`` We are reorganising the army , which was almost completely destroyed by Gaddafi and his gang before they left , '' he said . 
`` We are reforming , as much as we can , the army from the youth that took part in the revolution . '' 
Two amphibious assault ships , USS Kearsarge , which can carry 2,000 Marines , and USS Ponce , entered the canal on Wednesday en route to the Mediterranean . 
The destroyer USS Barry moved through the Suez Canal on Monday . 
The ships entered through the southern end of the canal , an official said , adding that they were expected to pass through by 3:30 p.m. -LRB- 1330 GMT -RRB- or 4:00 p.m. local time . 
Arab League foreign ministers meet on Wednesday at an extraordinary session in Cairo and are expected to reinforce their condemnation of Gaddafi . 
Some delegates want the meeting to underline the League 's unwillingness to see foreign intervention in Libya . 
`` We are looking at a lot of options and contingencies . 
No decisions have been made on any other actions , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said , noting the United Nations had not authorised the use of force in Libya . 
Italy said it was sending a humanitarian mission to Tunisia to provide food and medical aid to as many as 10,000 people who had fled violence in Libya on its eastern border . 
Tunisian border guards fired into the air on Tuesday to try to control a desperate crowd clamouring to cross the frontier . 
About 70,000 people have passed through the Ras Jdir border post in the past two weeks , and many more of the hundreds of thousands of foreign workers in Libya are expected to follow . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said : `` Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war . '' 
The U.S. Senate , in a unanimous vote , approved a resolution `` strongly condemning the gross and systematic violation of human rights in Libya , including violent attacks on protesters demanding democratic reforms '' . 
The White House said the ships were being redeployed in preparation for possible humanitarian efforts but stressed it `` was not taking any options off the table '' . 
Gates said : `` Our job is to give the president the broadest possible decision space . '' 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe sounded a note of caution , saying military intervention would not happen without a clear United Nations mandate . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron , who said Britain would work with allies on preparations for a no-fly zone over Libya , said it was unacceptable that `` Colonel Gaddafi can be murdering his own people using airplanes and helicopter gunships '' . 
General James Mattis , commander of U.S. Central Command , told a Senate hearing that imposing a no-fly zone would be a `` challenging '' operation . 
`` You would have to remove air defense capability in order to establish a no-fly zone , so no illusions here , '' he said . 
`` It would be a military operation . '' 
Analysts said Western leaders were in no mood to rush into conflict after drawn-out involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
The U.N. General Assembly unanimously suspended Libya 's membership of the the U.N. Human Rights Council because of violence by Gaddafi 's forces . 
Gaddafi , a survivor of past coup attempts , has told television networks : `` All my people love me , '' dismissing the significance of the rebellion that has ended his control over much of oil-rich eastern Libya . 
The Libyan leader has , however , faced defections from soldiers , diplomats and ministers . 
Gaddafi replaced two of his ministers who had defected to support the uprising seeking to oust him , Libyan state television said on Wednesday . 
Rebel fighters said the balance of the conflict was swinging their way . 
`` Our strength is growing and we are getting more weapons . 
We are attacking checkpoints , '' said Yousef Shagan , a spokesman in Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli . 
The rebel army officer in the eastern city of Ajdabiyah said rebel units were becoming more organised . 
`` All the military councils of Free Libya are meeting to form a unified military council to plan an attack on Gaddafi security units , militias and mercenaries , '' Captain Zwei said . 
Despite the widespread collapse of Gaddafi 's rule , his forces were fighting back in some regions . 
A reporter on the Tunisian border saw Libyan troops reassert control at a crossing abandoned on Monday , and residents of Nalut , about 60 km -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- from the border , said they feared pro-Gaddafi forces were planning to recapture the town . 
Mohamed , a resident of rebel-held Misrata , told Reuters by phone : `` Symbols of Gaddafi 's regime have been swept away from the city . 
Only a -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- battalion remains at the city 's air base but they appear to be willing to negotiate safe exit out of the air base . 
We are not sure if this is genuine or just a trick to attack the city again . '' 
Many on the streets of Tripoli on Tuesday expressed loyalty , but a man who described himself as a military pilot said : `` One hundred percent of Libyans do n't like him . '' 
The U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday unanimously suspended Libya 's membership of the U.N. Human Rights Council . 
A U.N. Security Council resolution on Saturday called for a freeze on Gaddafi 's assets and a travel ban and refers his crackdown to the International Criminal Court . 
The United States has frozen $ 30 billion in Libyan assets . 
Libya 's National Oil Corp said output had halved due to the departure of foreign workers . 
Brent crude surged above $ 116 a barrel on Tuesday as supply disruptions and potential for more unrest in the Middle East and North Africa kept investors edgy .

2011-03-03,"NEW : Dutch authorities confirm 2 people shown on Libyan TV are captured crew members Libyan state TV says the aircraft was a fighter helicopter with no permission to enter The crew was trying to rescue a Dutch citizen from Libya when armed men captured them `` Intensive negotiations '' are under way to get them freed , the Dutch defense ministry says Are you in Libya ? 
Share your protest photos and video with CNN , but only if you can do so safely . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dutch authorities continued to press Thursday for the release of three Navy personnel captured by armed men loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi days earlier during an evacuation operation . 
`` Intensive diplomatic negotiations '' are going on between Dutch and Libyan authorities and relatives of the crew are being kept informed , said Otte Beeksma , a spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Defense . 
The crew members were trying to evacuate a Dutch citizen from the Sirte area when they were taken prisoner , he said . 
They deployed in a Lynx helicopter from the HMS Tromp , anchored off the Libyan coast , he said . 
A report on Libyan state television stated that the crew was in a fighter helicopter rather than one used for transportation or rescue . 
It claimed the aircraft did not have permission from Libyan authorities to enter the country , a violation of international law . 
The state TV broadcast showed pictures of those believed to be the crew , as well as the helicopter and images of weapons . 
After looking at the still pictures and video , Dutch authorities confirmed Thursday that at least two of the three people shown on the Libyan state TV footage are captured helicopter crew members , according to Beeksma . 
Beeksma said that the ship 's communications officer and Dutch consular authorities tried to negotiate the crew 's release soon after they were taken captive , but they were not immediately successful . 
The Dutch citizen they were trying to rescue and another European Union national have been transferred to the Dutch Embassy in Tripoli , Beeksma said , without saying whether the Dutch Navy had made contact with them . 
News of their capture has not been made public until now , to prevent further endangering the Navy personnel involved , Beeksma said .

2011-03-03,"By Catherine E. Shoichet , CNN Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez delivers a speech in Caracas on February 27 , 2011 . 
The Venezuelan leader proposes sending a goodwill commission to mediate in Libya `` Let 's not get carried away by the drums of war , '' Chavez says Gadhafi and Chavez have a close relationship Chavez claims `` a campaign of lies is being woven '' about Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Venezuela 's president has spoken with embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi about a proposal to bring an international mediation team to Libya , Venezuela 's information minister confirmed Wednesday . 
The two leaders conversed Tuesday , Minister Andrez Izarra said in a post on his Twitter account . 
`` All the contacts that Venezuela is making with the Arab world and the entire world is for peace in Libya . 
Tomorrow new developments , '' the tweet read . 
Earlier this week , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said the United States ' criticisms of Gadhafi had a clear aim : military invasion . 
Libyan protests : Raw and online Mass Libya exodus creates border chaos The United States has said all options are on the table . 
Speaking in Caracas Monday , Chavez proposed sending an international committee to Libya to mediate and help develop a peaceful solution to unrest in the North African country . 
`` Instead of sending marines and tanks and planes , why do n't we send a goodwill commission to try to help so that they do not continue killing in Libya ? 
They are our brothers , '' he said in a speech televised on the government-run network . 
Chavez and Gadhafi have a close relationship , having bonded partly over shared opposition to U.S. global influence . 
At a lavish Tripoli celebration commemorating 40 years of Gadhafi 's leadership in 2009 , the two leaders sat side-by-side during a two-hour military parade . 
That same year , a new football stadium in Benghazi was named after the Venezuelan leader . 
As rumors swirled about Gadhafi and his whereabouts last week , some suggested that he may be en route to Venezuela . 
Those reports proved to be false ; the Libyan leader later spoke publicly in his country 's capital . 
But the close ties between the two leaders remain strong . 
On Monday , Chavez said Gadhafi `` has been my friend and our friend for a long time '' in remarks broadcast on Venezuelan state television . 
`` We must be cautious . 
We know what our policy is : we do not support invasions , or massacres , or anything , no matter who does it . 
But there is no doubt that , regarding Libya , a campaign of lies is being woven -- the same that has been woven about Venezuela for a long time , '' he said . 
The U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime .

Please do not put yourself in a dangerous situation . 
Djerba , Tunisia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama said Thursday he approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help return to Egypt those Egyptian citizens who have fled to Tunisia to escape unrest in neighboring Libya as the United Nations called for stepped-up aid to refugees . 
Nearly 180,000 people , mainly foreign workers , have fled to the neighboring nations of Tunisia and Egypt amid fighting between government troops and rebels pushing to oust longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi , the U.N. refugee agency reported . 
About 95,000 people have crossed into Tunisia and another 83,000 into Egypt , the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated . 
But it was the would-be migrants stuck in Libya that was most concerning to Abeer Etefa , who on the Tunisian side of the border with Libya . 
`` We 're worried about people on the other side of the border , '' said the spokeswoman for the U.N. 's World Food Programme . 
`` We 're calling for humanitarian safe passage to deliver food inside to people in Tripoli and elsewhere . '' 
She said she had heard stories from recent arrivals of food shortages `` in many places of Libya . '' 
She praised the efforts of Tunisians along the border , but said their generosity had limits . 
`` They 've provided all they could , '' she said , adding that they `` ca n't continue . ''

'' 
`` Tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing Libya , and we commend the governments of Tunisia and Egypt for their response , even as they go through their own political transitions , '' Obama said . 
Zuheir Badr El-Din , the top airport official in the Tunisian city of Djerba , told CNN that France plans to fly chartered jets between that coastal city and Cairo six times a day for five days . 
Chaos has reigned on the Tunisian border for days as thousands have clamored to get out of Libya , and many have found themselves trapped in a no-man 's land between the two countries . 
Thousands more were housed in tents provided by UNHCR and the Tunisian military , and many have little money and no travel documents with them . 
In Djerba , about 90 km -LRB- 55 miles -RRB- from the border , hundreds of refugees waited Thursday for flights out . 
Some napped on the floor ; others sat up against the walls waiting . 
But the process appeared orderly , given the number of would-be passengers , as airport officials moved them along in orderly lines with no pushing or shoving . 
The majority carried only small bags containing the bare necessities that they managed to escape with . 
One elderly man 's luggage consisted of a tightly wrapped blanket -- the only possession that survived his journey out of Libya . 
` Awful ' conditions along Libyan border No-fly zone in Libya explained Gadhafi 's options if he leaves Libya Tired , filthy and stuck at border Earlier Thursday , UNHCR sounded an urgent appeal to governments to help in the mass evacuation required to get people out . 
And after a call among Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and representatives of Middle Eastern , European and U.N. organizations , the world body called for help to avert a humanitarian disaster . 
`` There is a strong need for urgent relief -- food , water , sanitation and shelter to the thousands on both sides of the Tunisian and Egyptian borders due to significant population movements , mainly of migrant workers , '' a U.N. statement warned . 
`` It is also necessary to prepare for a further possible escalation of humanitarian needs should conditions deteriorate inside Libya . '' 
The participants in Thursday 's talks , which included the Arab League , the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference , urged Libya to allow `` immediate and unimpeded access '' to determine what was needed . 
`` The situation here remains tense , '' said Firas Kayal , a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency on the Tunisian border . 
`` There is lots of congestion on this side of the border and we are hearing that many thousands are waiting on the Libyan side to come through . 
Village bakeries have increased production to feed the stranded , he said . 
`` The local community has been so generous in providing food , medicines and places to stay , but the capacity of the local community is reaching its limit because the numbers are so huge , '' he said . 
The refugees include Bangladeshis , Vietnamese , Thais , Koreans , Malians , Ghanaians and Sudanese who had entered Libya seeking work . 
But most of the workers are Egyptian citizens , and that country 's caretaker government has paid for flights from Djerba to Cairo to take them home .

Show us what 's happening , but only if you can do so safely . 
Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan aircraft bombed a section of eastern Libya on Wednesday as leader Moammar Gadhafi tried to retake control of an area seized by rebel forces . 
A CNN crew saw the aircraft drop two bombs near al-Brega , a town in the east with key oil and natural gas facilities . 
Later , a military aircraft dropped a third bomb . 
People on the ground shot and threw whatever they could at the aircraft , then fled . 
After one of the attacks , people carrying stretchers were seen running to the site of the bombing . 
Fighting also raged on the ground , as Gadhafi 's forces tried to take control of a university in al-Brega . 
A doctor told CNN there were four dead and 23 wounded at his hospital in the area , all victims of gunshot wounds . 
Residents of the town said the rebels maintained control of al-Brega , repelling Libyan ground forces . 
Earlier Wednesday , military aircraft bombed military camps on the outskirts of the town of Ajdabiya , a tribal leader said . 
The tribal leader , who did not want to be identified for safety reasons , said youths in Ajdabiya were massing and heading toward the conflict area to help defend the town , which has been in the control of rebel forces in recent days . 
Some military bases in eastern Libya have fallen into the hands of rebels as more members of the military have abandoned Gadhafi 's regime and joined the opposition . 
The bombings could support calls for the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent such attacks . 
The United States has said all options are on the table . 
Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said imposing a no-fly zone would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' 
Senator John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Wednesday that , while Libyans are not asking for foreign troops on the ground , they need `` the tools to prevent the slaughter of innocents on Libyan streets , and I believe that the global community can not be on the sidelines while airplanes are allowed to bomb and strafe . 
A no-fly zone is not a long-term proposition , assuming the outcome is what all desire , and I believe that we ought to be ready to implement it as necessary . '' 
The Arab League met Wednesday to consider a resolution rejecting foreign military intervention in Libya , where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks , calling for more freedoms and for the longtime ruler to step down . 
`` We perceive what happened and what is happening is an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments , '' the Arab League said in a statement . 
Bombing in Libyan oil town Writer tells of brutality in Libya Should U.S. arm Libyan rebels ? 
Guns and oil in rebel controlled Libya As Gadhafi 's forces launched their attacks , the 68-year-old leader warned that `` thousands and thousands of people will be killed '' if the United States or NATO `` intervene in our country . '' 
In another of his trademark , rambling speeches carried live on state television , Gadhafi continued to claim that there are no peaceful Libyan protests , only al Qaeda-backed efforts to tear the country apart . 
He blamed the problems on former prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , who were released to Libya and then freed by Libyan authorities after they pledged to reform . 
He said they turned out to be members of al Qaeda sleeper cells -- but insisted that his country is `` stopping al Qaeda from flourishing '' and preventing Osama bin Laden from moving into North Africa . 
Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for more than 41 years , also denied having any assets besides `` history , the people , the glory -- not the American dollars or the oil . '' 
The speech lasted about 2-1\/2 hours . 
He also spoke Wednesday with Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez , according to the Venezuelan Ministry of Popular Power . 
Later , several thousand people , including many young men and women , took part in a pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli 's Green Square . 
Some residents of the capital have told CNN they want to protest Gadhafi but fear being killed by his forces . 
And some have said Gadhafi forces have dragged residents into the streets and forced them to take part in rallies praising the leader . 
A spokesman for the Libyan government , Musa Ibrahim , told CNN that assertions of widespread military attacks on peaceful demonstrators are wrong . 
`` This is an armed rebellion , with people going around attacking police stations , army offices , getting a hold of guns and attacking , '' he said . 
He said the government had supported the initial peaceful protests , but said al Qaeda supporters have hijacked that movement `` and they are leading the country into chaos . '' 
Asked for evidence , he said , `` We have captured dozens of these people , we have figures , we have interviews , we are willing and prepared to take these people and show them on international media . '' 
But numerous witnesses have described indiscriminate killings and attacks . 
The International Criminal Court announced it is opening an investigation into Libya . 
`` Following a preliminary examination of available information , the prosecutor has reached the conclusion that an investigation is warranted , '' the court said in a statement . 
US , allies debate no-fly zone for Libya Libyan protests : Raw and online CNN crew witnesses air bombing in Libya Mass Libya exodus creates border chaos The conflict between Gadhafi 's government and opponents , in its third week , followed protests in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia that ousted those countries ' leaders . 
International efforts to persuade him to follow the message of protesters and step down have also ratcheted up . 
The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution Tuesday to suspend Libya from its seat on the 47-member chamber Human Rights Council . 
It was the first time the assembly had suspended a member of the council . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly that he welcomed the decision and urged the international community to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Libya . 
`` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . 
`` We demand an immediate end to the violence toward civilians and full respect for their fundamental human rights , including those of peaceful assembly and free speech . '' 
He added that reports from the ground `` are sobering , '' with deaths and ongoing repression . 
`` Arms depots and arsenals have reportedly been opened to gangs who terrorize communities . 
There are reports that government forces have fired indiscriminately on peaceful protesters and bombed the military bases in the east of the country , '' Ban said . 
`` The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown , but likely to exceed 1,000 , '' with thousands more wounded , he added , using the same fatality figure he had used Friday . 
Libya 's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that the death toll was about 2,000 . 
Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the leader 's 38-year-old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests , told CNN Tuesday that his talks with the opposition were in `` chaos '' because the opposition is divided , with no clear leaders . 
U.S. officials made similar comments about the opposition . 
A U.S. official who wanted to remain anonymous because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it is `` unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult '' for the United States to provide assistance . 
The capital city of Tripoli remained under the control of Gadhafi 's rule , though opposition forces have taken control of the eastern city of Benghazi and a number of other cities . 
The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya 's borders into Egypt and Tunisia , and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders . 
Ban called for immediate action by the international community . 
`` Time is of the essence , '' he said . 
`` Thousands of lives are at stake . ''

2011-03-03,"Prosecutor to probe allegations of killing protesters , illegal detention , airstrikes on civilians If troops commit crimes , Moammar Gadhafi could be held responsible , prosecutor says Anti-Gadhafi forces also could be investigated , he warns It 's the first time the International Criminal Court has probed an ongoing event Are you in Libya ? 
Show CNN what 's happening . 
Please do not put yourself in a dangerous situation . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and some of his sons and closest advisers face investigation for alleged crimes against humanity , International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Thursday . 
`` I would like to use this opportunity to put them on notice , '' Moreno-Ocampo told CNN . 
`` I want to be clear : If their troops commit crimes , they could be made criminally responsible . '' 
It is the first time the court will be investigating allegations as an event is ongoing . 
They include allegations of security forces killing unarmed protesters , forced displacement , illegal detention and airstrikes on civilians . 
Gadhafi in crimes against humanity probe Bombing in Libyan oil town Investigators will look at the most serious accusations in Libya since February 15 , the prosecutor said , when demonstrations against Gadhafi ramped up . 
Moreno-Ocampo provided a map showing the locations where alleged crimes may have been committed . 
He cautioned , however , that he needed more time to review the evidence . 
`` This is the beginning of the investigation . 
I can give no details , '' he said . 
`` We can not confirm these allegations that these civilians were bombed by planes . 
But we have ... confirmation that civilians that were demonstrating were shot by security forces . 
`` We interview people and we will present the evidence to the judges . 
The judges will decide who should be prosecuted , '' he said . 
But Moreno-Ocampo warned that anti-Gadhafi protesters would also be held accountable for criminal activity . 
`` Now , it 's not just civilian demonstrations . 
Now , there are people opposing Gadhafi with weapons . 
And also we would like to warn them , you can not commit crimes . 
Our business in Libya is -LRB- to -RRB- stop the crimes , '' he said . 
The prosecutor will offer Gadhafi and others `` any opportunity they want to provide their own version -LRB- of events -RRB- . 
Because we have to be impartial . 
But also , we want to warn the other parties . 
No one can commit crimes in Libya . '' 
Moreno-Ocampo emphasized it was the first time the ICC was able to respond in real time to allegations , partially due to social-networking sites such as Facebook . 
`` This triggered a very quick reaction . 
The -LRB- United Nations -RRB- Security Council reacted in a few days ; the U.N. General Assembly reacted in a few days . 
So , now because the court is up and running we can do this immediately , '' he said . 
`` I think Libya is a new world . 
How we manage the new challenge -- that 's what we will see now . '' 
Moreno-Ocampo , who said he plans to finish his investigation within weeks and hopes to have the judge 's decision within months , also announced the probe at a press conference Thursday . 
`` We identified some individuals with a factor of formal authority who have authority on the security forces who allegedly committed the crimes , '' he told reporters . 
`` They are Moammar Al Gadhafi , his inner circle including some of his sons who have a facto authority , but also there are some people with formal authority that should pay attention to the crimes committed by their people because if they are not preventing stopping and punishing these crimes they could be responsible in accordance with the law . 
`` They are minister of foreign affairs , the head of the regime security and intelligence , the head of Gadhafi personal security and the head of Libyan external security . 
So we would like to use this opportunity to put them on notice . 
If forces under their command commit criminal acts , they could be responsible . ''

2011-03-03,"The growing humanitarian crisis in Libya and the flood of people fleeing into Tunisia -LRB- above -RRB- are increasing pressure on the U.S. and Western allies to react more forcefully . 
CNN Pentagon correspondent Christopher Lawrence shares insights into Libya situation Arab League has said it is against any foreign intervention in Libya Lawrence : United States still has the ability to impose a successful no-fly zone U.S. unlikely to divert troops , material from Afghanistan to Libya , Lawrence says Editor 's note : Christopher Lawrence is a Pentagon correspondent for CNN\/U . 
S. Previously , Lawrence had worked as a correspondent for CNN based out of the network 's Los Angeles and Chicago bureaus . 
He is also a veteran of the U.S. Navy Reserve . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The people 's revolt against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi remains dangerous -- and fluid . 
On Thursday , U.S. military aircraft and French charter jets joined efforts to get tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting back home as the United Nations called for stepped-up aid to refugees . 
The humanitarian gestures came a day after Gadhafi warned that `` thousands will die '' if the United States or its allies attack Libya , and Defense Secretary Robert Gates cautioned members of Congress of the difficulties that would be inherent in such a move . 
CNN.com turned to Pentagon correspondent Christopher Lawrence for some insights into the complexity of the situation . 
Question : The Arab League has said it is against any foreign intervention in Libya , even though it has called for Gadhafi to leave . 
Is it possible for the U.S. and its allies to work around this ? 
Calls for military action in Libya Tired , filthy and stuck at border Christopher Lawrence : The United States still has the ability to impose a successful no-fly zone , even without the Arab League , -LRB- but -RRB- Defense Secretary Robert Gates is extremely hesitant to project American military power into this conflict -- especially a highly visible symbol like U.S. fighter jets . 
Question : If a no-fly zone is to be enforced , Robert Gates has said it must begin with attacks against Libyan air defenses . 
`` That 's the way you do a no-fly zone , '' he told a House committee . 
He also said such an engagement is not possible with a nation the size of Libya `` with the planes you would find on a single aircraft carrier . '' 
Chief of Naval Operations Gary Roughead indicated that the USS George H.W. Bush is still in Norfolk , Virginia . 
Is the sense here that the clock is ticking and it might be too late for the U.S. to mount a meaningful no-fly operation on its own ? 
Lawrence : Part of Gates ' comment about `` not enough planes on one carrier '' refers to the fact the United States would not undertake this mission unilaterally . 
So even if the USS GHW Bush arrived , the Pentagon would not want to solely depend on U.S. assets . 
They would be expecting to use some land bases in Italy , for example , which has recently suspended its `` friendship treaty '' with Libya . 
That conceivably opens up Italy to the ability to stage missions . 
And British Prime Minister David Cameron has already signaled the British military to start working up plans with allies in case a decision is reached to impose a no-fly zone . 
Question : What are the main issues that need to be addressed if the decision is made to enforce a no-fly zone ? 
Lawrence : There would need to be numerous answers to `` rules of engagement '' questions first : -- What 's considered a `` hostile act '' ? 
-- Is it Libyans firing on other Libyans -- or coalition planes ? 
-- Would the U.S. jets be able to fire on Libyan air assets on the ground , before they take off ? 
There is a sense that before any no-fly zone is imposed , the United States and its allies need to answer a fundamental question : Is this no-fly zone being enforced to protect the Libyan people on humanitarian grounds ? 
Or is it being enforced to help the Libyan people overthrow Gadhafi ? 
It sounds simple , but each answer can come with vastly different rules of engagement . 
Question : Would the Obama administration consider the possibility of redeploying any troops and materiel from Iraq or Afghanistan ? 
Lawrence : I have n't heard talk of any -LRB- redeployment of -RRB- forces and\/or equipment of any real scope mentioned . 
Afghanistan is such a priority right now . 
With the president 's July 2011 date to at least symbolically start the withdrawal , it 's hard to conceive assets being diverted from there to Libya . 
This is unlike say Bahrain , where the U.S. bases its all-important 5th Fleet or even Egypt , which keeps the peace with Israel . 
Libya does not rise to a level of strategic importance that officials would take assets from Afghanistan .

2011-03-03,"President Obama said that `` the aspirations of the Libyan people for freedom , democracy and dignity must be met . '' 
President Obama cites Libyan leader by name for the first time U.S. steps so far are humanitarian Obama says all options , including a no-fly zone , are on the table Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama said Thursday he authorized the use of U.S. military and civilian aircraft to help return to Egypt those Egyptian citizens who have fled to Tunisia to escape unrest in neighboring Libya . 
At a joint news conference with visiting Mexican President Felipe Calderon , Obama said the United States is examining a `` full range of options '' in the Libyan crisis . 
For the first time since the Libyan crisis began , Obama cited Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi by name in a public statement , saying , `` The violence must stop . 
Moammar Gadhafi has lost legitimacy to lead , and he must leave . 
Those who perpetrate violence against the Libyan people will be held accountable , and the aspirations of the Libyan people for freedom , democracy and dignity must be met . '' 
However , Obama stopped short of committing U.S. help for creating a no-fly zone over Libya , as called for by anti-Gadhafi figures and some U.S. Congress members . 
Instead , he announced steps to deal with the growing humanitarian crisis involving refugees from Libya who have crossed the border into Tunisia and Egypt . 
In addition to military aircraft , Obama said he authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter civilian aircraft to help in the refugee effort . 
`` And we 're supporting the efforts of international organizations to evacuate people as well . 
I 've also directed USAID to send humanitarian assistance teams to the Libyan border so that they can work with the United Nations , NGOs and other international partners inside Libya to address the urgent needs of the Libyan people , '' he said . 
Asked about a no-fly zone , Obama said it remained among the options available in case the situation in Libya deteriorates . 
`` What I 've instructed the Department of Defense as well as our State Department and all those involved in international affairs to examine is a full range of options , '' Obama said . 
`` I do n't want us hamstrung . 
I want us to be making our decisions based on what 's going to be best for the Libyan people in consultation with the international community . '' 
The conflict in Libya could become a bloody stalemate , Obama said , adding that he wanted to ensure that `` the United States has full capacity to act , potentially rapidly , if the situation deteriorated in a such a way that you had a humanitarian crisis on our hands or a situation in which civilians were -- defenseless civilians -- were finding themselves trapped and in grave danger . '' 
In apparent response to criticism that the United States should be more involved in toppling Gadhafi , through a no-fly zone or arming anti-government forces in Libya , Obama said it was important to ensure that the Libyan people feel `` full ownership '' for any transformation and cited Egypt 's recent revolution as an example . 
`` We did not see anti-American sentiment arising out of that movement in Egypt precisely because they felt that we had n't tried to engineer or impose a particular outcome , but rather they owned it , '' Obama said . 
In Libya on Thursday , the Libyan military bombed two key towns in the east as it stepped up efforts to reclaim a region lost to rebels . 
The aircraft targeted al-Brega and Ajdabiya , both of which also were hit with bombs Wednesday . 
Opposition forces told CNN they were forging ahead , working to maintain their positions and fend off attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces .

2011-03-03,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : Obama says the U.S. is examining `` a full range of options '' NEW : Libyan state TV says the Dutch crew was in a fighter helicopter Bombs dropped on al-Brega and Ajdabiya The International Criminal Court prosecutor puts Libyan leaders `` on notice '' Ajdabiya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Libyan military bombed two key towns in the east again Thursday , stepping up efforts to reclaim a region lost to rebels . 
The aircraft targeted al-Brega and Ajdabiya , both of which were hit with bombs Wednesday . 
Opposition forces told CNN they were forging ahead , working to maintain their positions and fend off attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces . 
Rebels have armed themselves in some cases by raiding military installations and police stations . 
Morale on the part of the opposition seems to be high , while morale among Gadhafi 's forces -- which have seen defections as some members of the military have joined the protests -- seems low , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported from eastern Libya . 
Bombing in Libyan oil town Libyan jets Thursday dropped two bombs over al-Brega -- one near a military checkpoint and one near the main gate to a refinery , witnesses reported . 
In Ajdabiya , a tribal leader said the military dropped two bombs on military camps . 
Witnesses told CNN one bomb was near an ammunition depot . 
The situation in Libya is different from those in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt , where uprisings turned into revolutions that overthrew their rulers . 
Libya is facing a battle between government forces and rebel forces . 
`` This is becoming a war , '' Wedeman tweeted . 
The more Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi uses aerial attacks , the more pressing discussions become in the West about imposing a no-fly zone over the country . 
U.S. military and diplomatic officials -- including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- have all said enacting a no-fly zone is complicated and risky , and international support for the idea is not there yet . 
`` If it 's ordered , we can do it , '' Gates said , but imposing a no-fly zone `` begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses . '' 
Libya 's deputy U.N. ambassador , Ibrahim al-Dabashi , appealed to the United Nations to impose a no-fly zone over the country after he broke with Gadhafi 's regime and expressed support for the protesters more than a week ago . 
U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday the United States is examining a `` full range of options '' in the Libyan crisis . 
There is a danger of a `` bloody stalemate '' in Libya , he said , adding that he wants to be sure the United States `` has the capacity to act quickly in event of humanitarian crisis . '' 
`` Col. Gadhafi needs to step down from power and leave , '' Obama said . 
`` It 's the right thing to do . '' 
The president also warned that advisers to Gadhafi need to understand that they will be held accountable for any violence they perpetrate against civilians . 
`` They should know history is moving against Col. Gadhafi , '' Obama said . 
The Arab League Wednesday rejected foreign intervention , saying Libya is facing `` an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments . '' 
But the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue , said Hisham Yousef , chief of staff of the Arab League . 
Gadhafi 's regime Thursday sought to create an impression that it still controls the vast majority of the country , with rebels in charge of only pockets . 
The government organized a trip for a CNN crew to visit a refinery in Zawiya controlled by the government . 
Rebels control the center of the city , but the refinery is on the outskirts . 
The refinery , Libya 's second largest , is operating at 80 % of its capacity , officials told CNN 's Nic Robertson . 
Managers said that while the refinery had not come under attack , some staff members had been unable to get to work . 
US , allies debate no-fly zone for Libya Libyan protests : Raw and online CNN crew witnesses air bombing in Libya Protesters calling for the ouster of longtime leader Gadhafi have taken to the streets for a third week amid clashes with government forces . 
He has been in power for nearly 42 years . 
Musa Ibrahim , a spokesman for Gadhafi 's regime , told CNN , `` We need tribal intervention , social intervention to help us convince these people to come to the negotiating table . '' 
The government spokesman denied any attacks on peaceful protesters despite numerous reports from the country of unarmed demonstrators being shot indiscriminately . 
More than 1,000 people are reported to have been killed and many more injured during the protests , according to the United Nations . 
Libya 's ambassador to the United States has estimated that the death toll was about 2,000 . 
The International Criminal Court Thursday said Gadhafi and some of his sons and advisers are under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity . 
`` I would like to use this opportunity to put them on notice , '' ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told CNN . 
`` I want to be clear : If their troops commit crimes , they could be made criminally responsible . '' 
It is the first time the court will be investigating claims as they are allegedly occurring . 
Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute , which created the ICC , and does not recognize the authority of the international court . 
But the United Nations Security Council referred the matter to the court , essentially giving it `` jurisdiction '' over the situation in Libya , the court said . 
Nations have scrambled to evacuate hundreds of citizens as the unrest continues . 
The Netherlands defense ministry said Thursday that three Dutch navy personnel were captured by armed men loyal to Gadhafi during an evacuation operation Sunday . 
The ministry did not release information earlier because of safety reasons . 
Libyan state TV said the personnel were in a fighter helicopter and did not have permission from Libyan authorities to enter . 
The state TV report showed pictures of those believed to be the crew , as well as the helicopter and images of weapons . 
The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya 's borders into Egypt and Tunisia , and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders . 
Obama said he approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help return to Egypt those Egyptian citizens who have fled to Tunisia to escape the unrest in Libya . 
Obama said he has also authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter civilian aircraft to help people from other countries get back home .

Full Article Global war crimes court to investigate Gaddafi THE HAGUE | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 10:52 pm IST THE HAGUE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The international war crimes tribunal said on Thursday it would investigate Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , his sons and members of their inner circle for crimes committed by their security forces . 
Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo of the Hague-based International Criminal Court , pointing to a bloody crackdown on demonstrators against Gaddafi 's rule in which thousands may have died , said that no one had the authority to massacre civilians . 
He said the court would investigate `` serious crimes '' and had identified several people at the top of the command chain who could be investigated . 
`` They are Muammar Gaddafi , his inner circle including some of his sons , who had de facto authority , '' Moreno-Ocampo said . 
If opposition groups also have weapons and commit crimes , their leaders will also be investigated . 
`` We will act with impartiality , '' he said . 
The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Gaddafi and his family on Saturday , and referred Libya 's crackdown on demonstrators to the court . 
Gaddafi has vowed to stay in Libya and fight to the death since protests against his 41-year rule began in mid-February , inspired by the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt that ousted longstanding authoritarian rulers . 
The prosecutor said air strikes and attacks , alleged to have been made by security forces , and illegal detentions of hundreds of people would be investigated , including violence in the eastern city of Benghazi on Feb. 15 and attacks in the capital Tripoli on Feb. 20 . 
`` No one has the authority to attack and massacre civilians , '' Moreno-Ocampo said , adding that he could request the issue of arrest warrants over the atrocities in a few months ' time . 
Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim called the probe `` close to a joke '' since no fact-finding mission had been sent to his country , and said it was based purely on media reports . 
`` We have armed gangs having tanks , aircraft and machineguns and attacking police stations , army camps , ports and airports and occupying Libyan cities . 
This is far away from a peaceful movement , '' he told BBC radio . 
Khaled Kaim , deputy Libyan foreign minister , told Al Arabiya `` We are not under the jurisdiction of the court , we are not signatories ... The court has no power over Libya . '' 
Other people in Gaddafi 's circle who will come under the court 's scrutiny include the commander of the 32nd brigade , foreign mercenaries , a government spokesman and the National Security Adviser , Moreno-Ocampo said . 
He did not name them but said the inner circle included some of Gaddafi 's sons . 
The 32nd brigade leader is Gaddafi 's son Khamis . 
Outside that circle , he pointed to the head of Gaddafi 's personal security , the director general of the Libyan External Security Organisation , the head of the Security Forces and other organization leaders as potential suspects . 
Earlier on Thursday , Gaddafi 's forces struck at rebel control of oil export hubs in eastern Libya for a second day as Arab states weighed a plan to end the turmoil . 
Rebels are also calling for a no-fly zone , echoing a demand by Libya 's deputy U.N. envoy , who now opposes Gaddafi . 
The ICC has no police force and has struggled in the past to have suspects arrested . 
\* Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir is still at large after being charged with genocide in Darfur \* Uganda 's Lord 's Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony has eluded efforts to capture him . 
\* Former Liberian president Charles Taylor was arrested , and is now on trial for war crimes at the Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague . 
Bill Pace , head of a coalition of NGOs that support the work of the court , said the Security Council and member states should now stand by the referral and ensure that arrests are made . 
`` The involvement of the ICC indicates that crimes of grave concern will not be tolerated , '' Pace said .

2011-03-03,"Libya unrest costs Russia $ 4 billion in arms deals : media MOSCOW | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 8:55 am EST MOSCOW -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Russia will lose $ 4 billion in arms deals due to unrest in Libya , Russian news agencies quoted Sergei Chemezov , head of the state holding company that controls weapons exports , as saying on Thursday . 
Chemezov , chief of Russian Technologies , spoke days after Russia supported a U.N. Security Council resolution imposing an arms embargo on Libya 's government . 
Russian Technologies controls state arms exporter Rosoboronexport . 
`` Rosoboronexport 's lost profits due the situation in Libya amount to $ 4 billion , '' state-run RIA quoted Chemezov as saying . 
The reports did not mention any specific deals . 
The daily Kommersant on Monday cited a source as saying that Russia currently had $ 2 billion worth of arms contracts with Libya and was close to concluding deals to sell military aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles worth another $ 1.8 billion .

2011-03-03,"DUBAI | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 12:45 pm EST DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As Libya 's embattled leader pelts rebel strongholds with bombs near the country 's coastal oil export hubs , the risk of long-term damage to the OPEC country 's oil industry is rising . 
Libya 's battle lines are shifting daily , with rebels in tenuous control of the east , but the fighting is increasingly taking place near oil industry infrastructure on the coast . 
Since unrest began weeks ago in the North African country , which typically pumps around 1.6 million barrels a day -LRB- bpd -RRB- , around 750,000 bpd has been shut in as workers flee . 
The disruptions helped push Brent crude prices to 30-month highs this week near $ 118 a barrel . 
But so far , the conflict has spared Libya 's oil infrastructure , including its key export terminals , pipelines and well equipment , worth billions . 
As the stand-off devolves into what looks increasingly like a civil war , oil experts and analysts are seeing an increasing risk of long-lasting damage to Libya 's largely foreign-run oil sector , which could keep oil prices high for a long time . 
The stakes are clear . 
Libya holds Africa 's largest oil reserves , and crude shipments account for 95 percent of its export revenues . 
Neither Gaddafi nor rebels want to see the spoils fall into enemy hands . 
European refiners , especially in Italy , rely heavily on Libya 's prized light crude . 
But both the Gaddafi regime and rebels have said publicly they will not seek to destroy oil infrastructure . 
No damage to oil infrastructure was reported Wednesday and Thursday , when Gaddafi-loyal air force fighters attacked oil export hub town Brega . 
The town , currently in rebel hands , has passed back and forth between regime and rebel control in recent days . 
`` It has become likely that Libyan fighting will affect , and potentially destroy , oil infrastructure serving the country 's largest , central Sirte basin , which is right on the fault line between Gaddafi loyalists and rebels , '' said Samuel Ciszuk , Middle East analyst at IHS Energy in London . 
Gaddafi loyalists , who briefly captured Brega Wednesday , have since been repelled back to Ras Lanuf , another major oil terminal 600 km -LRB- 375 miles -RRB- east of capital Tripoli . 
`` Libya 's oil infrastructure has n't been damaged . 
But the risk of damage is increasing , and that could make it harder for Libya to resume oil supplies any time soon , '' said Carsten Fritsch , analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt . 
And after thousands of foreign oil workers have fled the country , concerns about oilfield maintenance in the remote interior are also rising . 
`` There are really two big concerns , '' said Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas . 
`` Over the course of a shutdown of production to evacuate staff , wells have to be handled very carefully . 
It 's not like turning a light bulb off and on again . 
The other concern is that we will see facilities affected by the fighting . '' 
The Sirte basin holds reservoirs with over 43 billion barrels of oil , which are tapped from both east and west , but it 's at risk of being cleaved down the middle . 
A trunk pipeline supplies oil flows that end up both in Ras Lanuf , still under Gaddafi 's control , and terminals further east which are run by AGOCO , a unit of the state-run National Oil Company that is now under the control of anti-Gaddafi engineers , Ciszuk said . 
AGOCO typically ships up to 450,000 bpd . 
Reports in recent days have shown tankers are still leaving Libya , but it 's not entirely clear who gets the revenue , Gaddafi or rebels . 
Digging in its heels , AGOCO has said it may start its own marketing division to negotiate with foreign buyers . 
Gaddafi-aligned oil minister Shokri Ganem , meanwhile , has claimed Libya 's oil sector remains firmly under regime control .

2011-03-03,"GENEVA | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 1:28 pm EST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- A United Nations report hailing Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's rights record was on Thursday sidelined by the world body 's Human Rights Council just a few days before it was due to be adopted . 
The report , reflecting a three-hour debate in the council last November , included praise for Libya from a range of countries who last Friday agreed that Gaddafi was a gross rights violator and backed his country 's removal from the body . 
Rights activist groups said the decision by the steering bureau of the council to postpone adoption of the report would avoid embarrassment for Islamic , African and countries like Cuba who had earlier lauded Gaddafi as a democrat . 
Hillel Neuer of UN Watch said the main effect of the report , compiled after a review of Libya 's record last November , `` was to bolster Gaddafi 's oppressive regime , demoralize his victims and harm the reputation of the U.N. '' U.S. ambassador to the council Eileen Donahoe said the report should not be adopted until `` the voices of the Libyan people , and not just the voice of the Gaddafi regime , can be reflected '' in the final text . 
Gaddafi struck at rebel control of a key coastal road for a second day on Thursday but received a warning he would be held to account at an international war crimes tribunal in the Hague for suspected crimes by his security forces . 
Countries who praised Libya during the November session , part of the five-year-old council 's Universal Periodic Review -LRB- UPR -RRB- process of all U.N. member states , included Iran , Algeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Syria , North Korea , Pakistan and Myanmar . 
But last Friday several of these who are members of the council -- including Pakistan and Algeria -- supported a resolution launching an international inquiry into the ongoing crackdown on protestors and asked the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Libya 's membership in the 47-member Geneva forum . 
The General Assembly , in which all U.N. member states sit , unanimously agreed to the move on Tuesday -- less than a year after three quarters of countries in the New York body had approved Libya 's accession to the rights council . 
The UPR process is supposed to provide an objective review of each country 's performance in observing international rights pacts which they have signed and underpin U.N. documents like the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
But critics say the process has been marked by determination among a majority council bloc of developing countries to ward off serious criticism by heaping praise on their allies -- as they do also in the council itself . 
Neuer of U.N. Watch , which closely monitors the council , said it should recognize the UPR on Libya was a fraud , withdraw the report and schedule a new session in which council countries `` would tell the truth about the Gaddafi regime 's heinous crimes . ''

2011-03-03,"AL-UQAYLA , Libya | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 9:59 pm GMT AL-UQAYLA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels pushed west on Thursday , extending their grip on a key coast road as Muammar Gaddafi received a warning he would be held to account at The Hague for suspected crimes by his security forces . 
Venezuela said the Libyan leader had agreed to its proposal for an international commission to negotiate an end to the turmoil in the world 's 12th largest oil exporting nation . 
But Gaddafi 's son Saif al Islam said there was no need for any foreign mediation in the crisis , a leader of the uprising rejected talks with the veteran leader , and the Arab League said cautiously the plan was `` under consideration . '' 
In Paris , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France and Britain would support the idea of setting up a no-fly zone over Libya if Gaddafi 's forces continued to attack civilians . 
U.S. President Barack Obama said the United States and the international community must be ready to act rapidly to stop violence against civilians or a humanitarian crisis in Libya . 
The uprising , the bloodiest yet against a long-serving ruler in the Middle East or North Africa , has torn through the OPEC-member country and knocked out nearly 50 percent of its 1.6 million barrels per day output , the bedrock of its economy . 
In eastern Libya , witnesses said a warplane bombed Brega the oil terminal town 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , for the second day , part of a struggle for control of a strategically vital coast road and oil industry facilities . 
Warplanes also launched two raids against the nearby rebel-held town of Ajbadiya , witnesses said . 
But Juma Amer , Secretary for African Affairs at the Libyan Foreign Ministry , told journalists : `` Media reports that civilian areas were bombed are false . 
Police had been and are urged to use maximum self restraint . '' 
Saif said Brega was bombed to scare off militia fighters and to gain control of oil installations . 
`` First of all the bombs -LRB- were -RRB- just to frighten them to go away , '' he told Britain 's Sky News . 
On the ground , rebels leading the unprecedented popular revolt pushed their front line west of Brega . 
They said they had driven back troops loyal to Gaddafi to Ras Lanuf , site of another major oil terminal and 600 km -LRB- 375 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . 
They also said they had captured a group of mercenaries . 
In an angry scene at al-Uqayla , east of Ras Lanuf , a rebel shouted at a captured young African and alleged mercenary : `` You were carrying guns , yes or no ? 
You were with Gaddafi 's brigades yes or no ? '' 
The silent youth was shoved onto his knees into the dirt . 
A man held a pistol close to the boy 's face before a reporter protested and told the man the rebels were not judges . 
In The Hague , International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Gaddafi and members of his inner circle , could be investigated for alleged crimes committed since the uprising broke out in mid-February . 
`` We have identified some individuals in the de facto or former authority who have authority over the security forces who allegedly committed the crimes , '' Moreno-Ocampo said . 
`` They are Muammar Gaddafi , his inner circle including some of his sons , who had this de facto authority . 
There are also some people with formal authority who should pay attention to crimes committed by their people . '' 
Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told BBC radio the news from The Hague was `` close to a joke . '' 
`` No fact-finding mission has been sent to Libya . 
No diplomats , no ministers , no NGOs or organizations of any type were sent to Libya to check the facts ... No one can be sent to prison based on media reports , '' he said . 
Ibrahim Mohammad Ali , a spokesman for the public security department , said Libya had told the United Nations it would allow visits by independent human rights observers . 
Libya is not a signatory of the ICC treaty , `` but we are willing to deal with the ICC and take action against anyone who has acted outside the law , '' he told a Tripoli news conference . 
A spokesman for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a Gaddafi ally , said the Libyan government had accepted a Venezuelan plan to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict in Libya . 
Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said the plan was under consideration and he was waiting for details from Caracas . 
Oil prices fell briefly on news of the plan , but traders said the fall was due to profit-taking and they were sceptical about any Venezuelan mediation . 
Brent crude fell more than $ 3 but by 2000 GMT had recovered to $ 114.82 . 
Chavez 's plan would involve a commission from Latin America , Europe and the Middle East trying to reach a negotiated outcome between the Libyan leader and rebel forces . 
An aide to Mustafa Abdel Jalil , head of the rebels ' National Libyan Council , told Reuters the rebels were open to talks only on Gaddafi 's resignation or exile to avoid more bloodshed . 
`` There is nothing else to negotiate , '' he said . 
He also called for foreign air strikes to set up a `` no-fly zone '' to help the rebels topple Gaddafi . 
Save The Children and Medecins Sans Frontieres said they were struggling to get medicine and care to Libya 's needy , with gunmen blocking roads and civilians too scared to seek help . 
The government has tried to persuade people in Tripoli that life continues as normal . 
But there were queues at banks , and residents said food prices had gone up and the street value of the Libyan dinar had fallen dramatically against the dollar . 
The official news agency said the Libyan parliament had cut car fuel prices by 25 percent to 0.15 dinars -LRB- $ 0.12 -RRB- a litre . 
A fish market near Tripoli 's Green Square was mostly empty . 
`` The situation is affecting us , '' said Ismail , a fisherman . 
`` All the Egyptian workers who run the boats have left . '' 
Just outside rebel-held Zawiyah , west of Tripoli , officials took foreign journalists to a local refinery to show it was controlled by the state . 
Officials said it was running normally . 
But in the center of Zawiyah , rebels were fully in control and said they had enough forces to repel any government attack . 
In the opposition stronghold of Benghazi , men of all ages gathered next to the courthouse engaged in fierce debates , enjoying their new-found freedom of speech . 
`` We must go to Tripoli and get rid of Gaddafi , '' shouted one , to murmurs of approval from those around him . 
`` But we have only our shirts to protect us from the cannon , '' said Ahmed el Sherif , 60 , standing on the edge of the group . 
The upheaval is causing a humanitarian crisis , especially on the Tunisian border where tens of thousands of foreign workers have fled to safety . 
But an organized international airlift started to relieve the human flood from Libya as word spread to refugees that planes were taking them home . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Ca n't they remember what happened when the hard line Shah of Iran was deposed with Western influence . 
We surely need another Iranian regime in Libya , I do n't think . 
The Arab countries have to have dictators of one sort or another as they are such an unruly lot . 
History has proven this over and over . 
I would like to plead to all sides in the current civil war in Libya : Please , do n't go mindlessly blowing up oil wells like Saddam 's forces did when they retreated from Kuwait 20 years ago . 
Cap the oil wells , if you must . 
Cut us Americans off , if you must . 
Charge whatever you want to charge for a barrel of oil . 
I realize that middle east nations do n't owe us cheap oil . 
But I earnestly believe it is wrong for humanity to waste billions of barrels of oil by blowing up oil wells . 
You remind me of those who like in the US and colonial Africa who always wrote blacks are not capable of doing anything good and relatives of monkeys . 
Sure only whites know how to start wars ? 
And do these dictators have to be appointed as before by our freedom loving governments ?

2011-03-03,"WASHINGTON | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 10:02 am EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - An unpublished U.S. diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks tells the previously undisclosed story of how an American corporate powerhouse -- the $ 35-billion Coca-Cola Co. -- got caught up in a fierce fraternal dispute between two of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's sons . 
The contretemps among the freres Gaddafi over a local bottling plant escalated into a heavily armed confrontation resembling a Hollywood gangster film , as a classified 2006 U.S. cable put it . 
`` You know the movie ` The Godfather ' ? 
We 've been living it for the last few months , '' a businessman involved in the dispute was quoted in the cable as telling an official from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Tripoli . 
The cable , which was made available to Reuters by a third party , centers on a bottling plant in Tripoli that was shut down for three months . 
It had been seized by troops loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , a son of Muammar , who at the time was feuding with one of his brothers , Mohammed . 
-LRB- Another State Department cable suggests a third Gaddafi son , Saadi -- better known as the family 's professional soccer player -- may also have been involved in the squabble , though no details of his role are given . -RRB- 
Eventually , the American diplomatic mission in Tripoli , known then as the U.S. Liaison Office , sent a firm protest to the Libyan government . 
The document states that around the same time , Mohammed Gaddafi , possibly under pressure from his sister Aisha , a family peacemaker , apparently agreed that shares owned by the Libyan Olympic Committee , which he led , would be sold to a third party . 
Shortly afterward , the cable says , Mutassim 's men left the Coke plant , ending the family standoff , but not before employees of the plant received threats of bodily harm and a Gaddafi cousin was stuffed in the trunk of a car . 
The Coca-Cola confrontation is among numerous tales about endless squabbling within the Gaddafi clan recounted in State Department cables . 
Among other things , the incident underlines the difficulties faced by foreign companies operating in Libya even after the U.S. and United Nations began to scale back sanctions following Muammar Gaddafi 's decision in late 2003 to abandon his nuclear weapons program . 
A spokesman for Coca-Cola acknowledged there had been `` some uncertainty '' surrounding Coke distribution arrangements in Libya during the period described in the cable . 
But the problem was `` resolved amicably '' by the end of 2006 , the spokesman said , and since then , Coca-Cola had been operating normally in Libya until the onset of the current unrest . 
A spokesman for the State Department said : `` We will decline to comment on any particular cable . 
The U.S. has taken aggressive action in recent days to freeze the assets of the Qaddafi family . 
Thus far , more than $ 30 billion in assets have been blocked . '' 
WORKERS THREATENED , PLANT MATERIALS DESTROYED Back when Libya was isolated by economic sanctions , its Coca-Cola supply was limited to consignments of the beverage bottled at a plant in Tunisia and transported to Tripoli and Benghazi . 
After U.S. and international trade embargoes on Libya began to ease , the Tripoli plant was established . 
It was co-owned by what the cable describes as a British company called Ka'Mur -- whose name was a reference to two embargo-era Libyan soft-drinks -- and by the Libyan Olympic Committee , headed by Mohammed Gaddafi . 
Immediately after this joint venture was set up , the State Department cable says , the embargo-era Libyan distributor of bottled Coke sued the group behind the newly-opened plant , alleging breach of contract . 
A complaint was also sent to Coca Cola International alleging that the bottling plant operators had `` stolen the franchise '' from the previous distributors , according to the cable . 
The bottling plant operators counter-sued . 
Then , on December 28 , 2005 -- two weeks after the Tripoli plant began turning out locally-bottled batches of Coke -- `` two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility , asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant , '' according to an account of the incident a businessman gave to U.S. diplomats . 
The U.S. mission in Libya learned from other sources that the troops were loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , who , after the Coca-Cola dispute was resolved , was named Libya 's national security adviser . 
According to the State Department cable , Mutassim bore a grudge against his brother because he had `` taken over '' the embargo-era domestic soft-drink business in the late 1990s when Mutassim had been exiled to Egypt for `` insubordination '' against their father . 
-LRB- Another cable says the `` rumor '' was that Mutassim had been linked to a coup attempt . -RRB- 
Sporadic violent incidents continued to erupt in the weeks after Mutassim 's forces occupied the bottling plant . 
Early in the siege , a businessman affected by the squabble told American diplomats , the occupation force would allow plant managers to enter the building alone or in pairs . 
But later employees were barred from the facility . 
During the weeks that followed , according to the State Department account , anonymous callers threatened three Coca-Cola employees , all Jordanian citizens , with `` political problems '' and bodily harm . 
Complaints to police , and later to Muammar Gaddafi himself , were met with indifference . 
The Libyan leader , according to the cable , `` declined to get involved personally '' yet urged plant owners to do `` everything within -LRB- their -RRB- power to resolve the matter according to Libyan law . '' 
Then , shortly before the plant reopened , Mutassim 's men `` abducted and assaulted '' one of Mohammed Gaddafi 's in-laws to `` send a signal , '' according to the cable . 
Earlier that day , it reported , one of Mohammed 's associates , after hearing Mutassim `` raging , '' phoned one the bottling plant 's founder to warn him to `` leave the city immediately '' because Mutassim 's men were coming to get him . 
That night , a posse of Mutassim 's associates turned up outside his brother 's home and began shouting for Mohammed Gaddafi to come outside . 
When they got no response , the cable reports , Mutassim 's men grabbed `` one of Mohammed 's cousins , '' who they proceeded to stuff into the trunk of one of their cars . 
The cable does not report the cousin 's ultimate fate . 
About a month later -- soon after the bottling plant had reopened -- two more violent incidents involving Mutassim Gaddafi occurred , according to the cable . 
On one occasion , according to a witness who talked to American diplomats , Mutassim personally `` assaulted '' an unnamed cousin of Mohammed Gaddafi -LRB- `` on his mother 's side '' , according to the cable -RRB- who was a member of the Libyan Olympic Committee headed by Mohammed . 
A day earlier , the cable said , Mutassim had assaulted another of Mohammed 's cousins . 
-LRB- The cable does not make clear whether either of these cousins might have been the cousin who earlier had been stuffed in a car trunk . -RRB- 
It was in the wake of these episodes that one of the U.S. diplomatic mission 's contacts offered the comment comparing his situation to `` The Godfather . '' 
In a `` hushed voice , '' the cable reports , the contact advised his American interlocutor that while he had heard `` stories '' about doing business in Libya , he had `` never imagined '' that what had occurred was still possible . 
`` ALL PARTIES '' WANTED STORY HUSHED UP After the bottling plant returned to operation , according to the State Department 's account , some contacts of U.S. diplomats said that a settlement between Mohammed and Mutassim Gaddafi had been brokered by their sister Aisha , described in other cables as a frequent arbiter of disputes among her fractious siblings . 
But other embassy contacts said that Mohammed Gaddafi decided on his own to lessen tensions with Mutassim by selling the Olympic Committee 's shares to a third party . 
The U.S. mission in Libya claimed some credit for helping to defuse the standoff . 
The cable says that because the principal company involved in operating the Tripoli bottling plant was not an American entity , U.S. diplomats were limited in what they could do . 
But in an effort to `` protect the broad interests of a brand representing several million USD in annual sales to a U.S.-based company , '' U.S. diplomats did contact influential Libyan officials to urge that the brotherly dispute be resolved : the U.S. mission sent what the cable describes as a `` strongly worded diplomatic note '' expressing `` serious concern over the plant closure and noting the growing risk of severe damage to U.S. investor confidence in Libya . '' 
Two days later , the plant reopened . 
The State Department cable describes the Coca-Cola conflict as a `` case study in the involvement of Qadhafi -LRB- sic -RRB- family members directly influencing the flow , pace and nature of economic activity . 
Family members squabble over personal financial interest with little regard to the possible impact on foreign investors or international public opinion . '' 
The Coca-Cola case , the cable adds , `` is typical of the power struggles likely to continue as the Qadhafi children and other regime elite continue to define -LRB- or re-define -RRB- their respective spheres of commercial influence . '' 
Apart from a brief mention on a website operated by Libyan dissidents , the cable adds , it was `` noteworthy that the news was kept out of the press , '' since `` all parties involved -- including the foreign companies -- had an interest in keeping things quiet as long as there seemed a possibility of a near-term solution .

2011-03-03,"LONDON | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 11:37 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Anyone who thought that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi would go quietly like his fellow dictators in Tunisia and Egypt may have to think again . 
He has never shied from spilling blood , and his end may well prove a bloody affair . 
Gaddafi has shown this week that he clearly intends to fight on and leading Libyan analysts say regime change will only come if those close to him force him aside . 
The Libyan leader , experts say , believes so profoundly that he is the embodiment of his country that he is willing to bring Libya down rather than give in a two-week-long revolt against his 41-year autocratic rule . 
`` There is a real danger that Libya is sliding toward a long , protracted civil war , '' said Fawaz Gerges , professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics . 
`` From everything we have seen so far Gaddafi is cornered , his back is to the wall and he has no exit strategy . 
He will most likely fight to the bitter end , '' he added . 
On the ground , Gaddafi appeared to have taken the initiative by launching a ground and air attack on rebels in control of the eastern oil terminal town of Brega . 
Both rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces are arming and positioning themselves for a longer fight and residents and tribes are being armed as well by both sides . 
`` In the last 48 hours Gaddafi seemed to have absorbed the first shock . 
He is consolidating his limited power base , '' said Gerges . 
`` The Gaddafi regime is positioning itself for a prolonged fight . 
He has adequate military and financial assets to fight . 
Even though Gaddafi has lost control over large swathes of Libya he seems ready to reduce the country to Somalia-like ruins rather than surrender power , experts say . 
`` Gaddafi reduced the Libyan people to his persona , '' said Saad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer who was involved in the negotiations over the Lockerbie bombing . 
`` Gaddafi 's aim will be to create chaos and put the country through civil war or Somalisation -- no central power , a divided country in which he will remain a force , '' said Djebbar . 
`` Gaddafi has containers of dollars , he has guns to arm people and he has loyalists , the more chaos he creates the better -LRB- for him -RRB- , '' Djebbar added . 
`` His message is : apres moi le deluge . 
You force me out of power and I will leave either a divided country or a country in civil war like Somalia . '' 
The uprising , the bloodiest yet against despotic rulers in the region , was sparked by the arrest of a human rights lawyer in Benghazi on February 14 . 
Revolt quickly spread , with Libyans from all walks of life -- professionals , academics , tribesmen , former soldiers and students -- demanding an end to Gaddafi 's repressive rule . 
Libyans have not experience democracy since he ousted King Idris and created a police state in 1969 . 
The mercurial leader has managed to cling to power through a carefully constructed security apparatus . 
The press remains gagged , despite a slight easing of curbs in recent years , freedom of speech is unheard of and political parties are illegal . 
But 41 years of repression have brought simmering discontent to the boil . 
Added to that , for many Libyans and world leaders , the former army officer is the evil hand behind terrorism inside and outside his country . 
Gaddafi has spent much of Libya 's oil cash financing terrorists responsible for hijacks and killings and groups seeking to kill dissidents and destabilize pro-Western governments in Africa . 
The Libyan upheaval has not only proven to be bloodier and costlier but more protracted than Tunis and Egypt , raising the risks of ethnic war that could fragment the country , trigger a humanitarian crisis and further jeopardize oil supplies . 
In Egypt and Tunisia , powerful military elites ultimately decided the outcome of the revolutions , easing unpopular leaders Hosni Mubarak and Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali from office . 
But in Libya it is more opaque and complex tribal power structures could decide how events play out . 
Having risen through the military himself , Gaddafi emasculated the army to prevent its commanders from threatening him following periodic failed coup attempts . 
`` He knows from his own experience that coup d'etats come from the army so he closed the way for any potential coup d'etat a long time ago . 
He dismantled the army and set up instead what he called the popular army , '' said Djebbar . 
He created well-armed and tightly knit brigades led by his own al-Gaddadfa tribe and by al-Magarha , another tribe headed by Abdullah Sanussi , Gaddafi 's brother-in-law and chief enforcer . 
Experts agree that part of the explanation for Gaddafi 's survival is linked to having his sons in charge of his security and his own tribe occupying the most important positions . 
`` His units are die-hard loyalists , based on skin and kin , blood ties which for Gaddafi are more important than ideology . 
He has his son Khamis who is in charge of a special army unit , '' Djebbar said . 
Those familiar with Gaddafi say he is the only decision-maker , a man with absolute authority who does not delegate power to anybody , not even to his own sons . 
On the ground , the balance of power looks equal . 
Gaddafi and his forces control the capital Tripoli and some nearby towns as well as his birthplace Sirte further east , the site of large arsenals and bases designed to guard oil infrastructure . 
The rebels hold Benghazi , Misrata and Zawiyah and Jebel Nafusa southwest of Tripoli . 
`` Gaddafi has not given up , the attack he launched on Brega is an indication that he intends to carry on , '' said George Joffe , a Middle East expert at Cambridge University . 
Despite the defection of large numbers of tribes some still support him including his own Gaddadfa community . 
`` The forces on the ground might be quite well balanced . 
It really can go on for quite some time . 
If you control Benghazi you control -LRB- the eastern region of -RRB- Cyrenaica , '' said Joffe . 
`` If you control Tripoli you control Tripolitania . 
In those circumstances you could have two forces relatively well balanced who can confront each other for a long time . '' 
On the table is a peace plan devised by from Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez , according to Secretary-General Amr Moussa . 
Venezuela says Gaddafi has accepted it , but there has been no confirmation . 
Rebels have said they would not negotiate with Gaddafi , and their reaction to the plan is not known . 
One scenario for a peaceful exit is to have some sort of tribal deal . 
This might see a combination of the sons of Gaddafi , his daughter and Sanussi push him aside and allow the Gaddadfa tribe and al-Magarha , former officers and dignitaries to enter into talks with tribes in the east to grant Gaddafi safe passage to retire in his hometown of Sirte . 
They in turn could make commitments to guarantee the security of the family . 
The other option is for him to go abroad with immunity from prosecution . 
But this option may not be possible after the International Criminal Court said Gaddafi and members of his inner circle could be investigated for alleged crimes committed against civilians by security forces . 
Joffe said he suspected Gaddafi would eventually be overthrown in a palace coup . 
`` The way it will come to an end is if his domestic support ends from his family , tribes , his own battalion or army unit -- if they remove their support he is finished ...

2011-03-03,"CARACAS | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 11:45 am EST CARACAS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's government has accepted a plan by Venezuela to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict in the North African country , a spokesman for President Hugo Chavez said on Thursday . 
Information Minister Andres Izarra also confirmed the Arab League had shown interest in the Chavez plan to send an international commission to talk with both sides in Libya . 
Revolts in Libya and elsewhere in the Arab world are politically awkward for Chavez due to his friendships in the region . 
But his relationship with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has been particularly warm with the pair showering each other with gifts and awards . 
Here are some details of their friendship : \* Chavez and Gaddafi have enjoyed a long-standing alliance based on shared military backgrounds , left-wing economic ideas , antagonistic relations with the United States and membership for both their nations of the OPEC oil producer group . 
\* In 2004 , Libya awarded its annual Gaddafi International Human Rights Prize to Chavez for resisting `` imperialism '' and being a champion of the poor . 
A citation with the award praised the Venezuelan leader 's `` brave heart , intelligent mind , eloquent oratory and firm hand . '' 
\* Chavez first visited Tripoli a year after taking office in 1999 and has returned five times . 
\* In 2006 , Libya named a new 11,000-seat soccer stadium after Chavez near the Mediterranean city of Benghazi . 
The Libyan soccer federation said Chavez was being honored for his `` brave humanitarian positions , especially in support of the people of Gaza in the recent Israeli aggression . '' 
\* Making a rare visit to the Americas , Gaddafi attended a Chavez-hosted summit of Latin American and African leaders in 2009 . 
Together , they called for a new world order countering Western economic dominance . 
\* After the meeting on Venezuela 's Caribbean resort island of Margarita , Chavez presented Gaddafi with a replica of a sword of South American independence hero Simon Bolivar . 
\* Last year , Chavez said he planned to govern from a Bedouin-style tent given to him by Gaddafi , to make space for homeless Venezuelans he invited to live at his palace . 
\* At the height of recent protests in Egypt , Chavez said he had spoken to Gaddafi and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for briefings on the situation . 
\* When the demonstrations and violence reached Tripoli , British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he had seen information suggesting Gaddafi had fled and was on his way to Venezuela . 
Libya and Venezuela 's governments denied it and Gaddafi later appeared on television to refute the rumors .

2011-03-04,"By Bryony Jones for CNN Protesters have taken control of several key cities across Libya , but government forces appear to be fighting back . 
U.N. has imposed sanctions against Gadhafi , freezing assets and blocking travel Some experts are calling for a no-fly zone , but further U.N. resolution would be needed Libya 's ambassador to U.S. says his people are being ` slaughtered like sheep ' , pleads for action -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than two weeks after protests against Moammar Gadhafi 's regime began , the Libyan leader is still clinging to power , insisting `` we will fight until the last man and woman to defend Libya . '' 
Continuing unrest and violence has left experts warning of a major humanitarian disaster , as thousands of people flee across the borders into neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . 
So what can the international community do to stop further bloodshed ? 
And will anything they do convince Gadhafi to step down after more than 40 years in power ? 
What about a no-fly zone to keep Libyan military aircraft out of the skies ? 
Some witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air , but U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Tuesday that these reports could not be confirmed . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the imposition of a no-fly zone was under consideration . 
But Mullen said doing so would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' 
Ali Suleiman Aujali , the Libyan ambassador to the U.S. who broke with the Libyan government over the use of force against protesters , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that his people were being `` slaughtered like sheep '' and the international community needed to step in -- or else stop encouraging the uprising . 
Should US arm Libyan rebels ? 
John McCain pushes Libya no-fly zone `` They have to dominate the skies , they have to stop the march of the tanks towards Misrata and towards Tripoli , '' he said . 
`` They have to take measures to stop these massacres going on in my country . 
If you ca n't act now , then do n't encourage us to die . '' 
John Bellinger , a former legal adviser to the U.S. State Department , told CNN , `` Legally , there is no authority for the United States or any other country to do that under international law unless authorized by the Security Council . 
`` Politically it could be quite problematic ... for the United States or NATO to begin shooting down Libyan aircraft , even in the face of the things that Gadhafi is doing against his own nationals . '' 
What role does the United Nations play ? 
The United Nations Security Council has already taken some action against the Gadhafi regime , but it has not authorized the use of armed force . 
Its members met at the weekend and voted unanimously for sanctions , including an arms embargo , assets freeze , and a travel ban for Gadhafi , his family , and key associates . 
However , they did not support calls for a no-fly-zone , and any decision on whether to impose one is likely to have to wait for a further U.N. resolution . 
If the U.N. did vote in favor of a no-fly-zone , NATO would likely play some role in enforcing it , but NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen insists no action could be taken without a U.N. mandate . 
`` A no-fly-zone is not a part of the U.N. Security Council resolution , and a far-reaching approach like that would require a U.N. Security Council mandate , '' he told CNN . 
`` It 's a hypothetical question at this stage , but if the issue is raised , and if there is a request -LRB- for cooperation -RRB- then the NATO council will consider it , but that 's not the case for the time being . 
`` We have started preparations for all eventualities , but I think it is a bit premature to outline any timeline . '' 
Is Italy 's decision to suspend its non-aggression pact significant ? 
If any military action , such as enforcing a no-fly-zone , were to be taken , troops would likely have to use air bases in Italy . 
Italy is also home to the U.S. Navy 's Sixth Fleet . 
Under a friendship treaty , signed three years ago by Gadhafi and Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi , Italy agreed to pay Libya compensation for its colonial rule of the country , and Libya pledged to help stem the tide of refugees heading for Italy from its shores . 
But the pact also included a non-aggression clause , under which Italy promised not to allow its territories to be used to launch military operations against Libya . 
The treaty was suspended over the weekend . 
What happens to Libya after Gadhafi ? 
Explain it to me : Libya unrest Possible military aid to Libya Explain it to me : Libya unrest Kurt Volker , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , told CNN that Italy 's suspension of the pact would not immediately enable military operations to be launched from that country . 
`` If you 're really trying to think about military action , do you have some kind of authorization to do so ? 
You would need a U.N. mandate and possibly a NATO declaration or both , and there is n't anything like that on the table at the moment , '' he said . 
Aldo Amati , deputy press secretary for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , insisted the treaty had not been suspended to pave the way for military action . 
`` There 's no connection , '' he told CNN . 
`` There 's no link between the two things . '' 
What about sanctions against the Gadhafi regime ? 
Gadhafi is no stranger to sanctions : He was subject to them for many years following Libya 's refusal to hand over suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 , in which 270 people were killed . 
This time around though , the international community has taken further action , freezing the Libyan leader 's assets and those of his family and the regime . 
The U.S. alone has blocked access to at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets , the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program . 
Travel bans too are likely to impact the Gadhafi family 's jet-setting lifestyle . 
What will the U.S. do ? 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insists that : `` Nothing is off the table , so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens . '' 
However , analysts say it seems unlikely that that the U.S. would launch attacks on Libya without a U.N. mandate . 
Rosemary Hollis , Professor of Middle East Policy Studies at City University London , said : `` The messy fact of Afghanistan and Iraq has been to deter any kind of gung-ho notion that you can sort our any very foreign country by force . '' 
But some prominent figures have called for other forms of military action to be taken - and quickly . 
Senator John McCain -LRB- R-Arizona -RRB- is one of those urging the introduction of a no-fly-zone : `` Libyan pilots are n't going to fly if there 's a no-fly-zone . '' 
And Senator Joe Lieberman -LRB- I-Connecticut -RRB- has gone one further , arguing that as well as offering aid to the rebels , the U.S. should be supplying them with weapons . 
Thomas Donnelly , of the American Enterprise Institute , says the mere sight of U.S. fighter jets over Libya would send a powerful message to Gadhafi . 
`` Even if we just buzzed the palace and did n't release any ordnance , the symbolic action or the psychological effect could be enough to bring the war to a quick conclusion , '' he said . 
The U.S. military is already close by : At least one destroyer is in the Mediterranean , and the amphibious assault ship the USS Kearsarge is in the Red Sea , close to the Suez Canal . 
The Kearsarge is well equipped to deal with casualties : it houses a floating hospital -- including six operating theaters -- which can care for up to 600 patients .

However , Hollis said without a U.N. resolution , action remains unlikely . 
`` The only way I think they would launch military action without a clear U.N. mandate is by covertly supporting the opposition on the ground , '' she said .

2011-03-04,"A tribal rebel fires a rocket-propelled grenade from a militia post on February 27 in Ajdabiya , Libya . 
Several powerful tribes have already shown support for the rebellion There are about 140 tribes and each is subdivided into clans Tribes play an important role in Libyan society They stood united to fight their Italian colonizers -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Soon after the Libyan rebellion escalated , a senior member of the nation 's powerful Warfallah tribe announced it would no longer support Moammar Gadhafi , saying that `` he is no longer a brother . '' 
The Zawiya tribe , based in a petroleum-rich region in the east , threatened to cut off oil flow . 
The Bani Walid tribe decided to withdraw its men from the regime 's security brigades . 
And the influential Zintan tribe , allied in the past to Gadhafi 's own tribe , broadcast a statement of support for the opposition . 
One after another , Libya 's myriad tribes are falling in line against Gadhafi , and the implications are enormous , said longtime observers of Libya , because for centuries , tribes have formed the backbone of the North African nation . 
Many Americans pride themselves on God and country . 
In Libya , it 's God , tribe , then country . 
Refugees flee Libya for Tunisia No-fly zone in Libya explained Who is the opposition in Libya ? 
Libya 's 140 or so tribes and the clan and family structure that fall under them remain the most important aspect of a society that lags behind many others in the region in development , said Ronald Bruce St. John , a scholar who has visited Libya numerous times and published several books about the country . 
With the exception of the Red Crescent Society and the Boy Scouts , few civil society institutions exist anymore in Libya , crushed by four decades of Gadhafi 's authoritarian rule . 
There are no trade unions , PTAs or Lions Clubs . 
The tribes have filled those gaps and because of that , they have perhaps taken on a stronger role in Libya than in other Arab nations . 
`` Libyans have a strong loyalty to tribe , '' said Philip Carl Salzman , a McGill University professor of anthropology and author of `` Culture and Conflict in the Middle East . '' 
`` A tribe provides welfare in times of need , '' he said . 
`` They have a collective responsibility . '' 
If one member of a tribe is attacked , the reaction is to help or exact vengeance , Salzman said . 
Tribes are especially involved in resolving family disputes . 
Gadhafi recognized the power of his nation 's tribes when he seized control in 1969 . 
He saw tribal leaders as traditional forces opposed to his radical socialist agenda , St. John said , and , at first , he tried to suppress them . 
But later he tried to co-opt them , establishing a People 's Social Leadership Committee , which essentially was a collection of tribal leaders . 
St. John said it was Gadhafi 's way of telling the tribes : You are now responsible for your people . 
If any member steps out of line , we expect you to discipline him or her . 
The committee 's creation followed an abortive coup supported by the Warfallah tribe , whose members formed a chunk of the military . 
LSE head quits over Libya links Celebs under fire for Libya concerts According to a U.S. State Department document , Gadhafi `` began to purge the military periodically , eliminating potential rivals and inserting his own loyal followers in their place . '' 
He filled the higher echelons of the military and elite government posts with members of his own Gadhadfa tribe , but pitted them against others . 
Gadhafi 's actions back then reflected Libya 's lack of nongovernmental organizations and the strongman 's official recognition of tribes in his own ideological manifesto , `` The Green Book , '' said St. John . 
Now , almost two decades later , tribal elders may hold the cards to their national future . 
Libya 's tribes have never wielded political power , but if Gadhafi falls , it 's likely that a provisional government would resemble a patchwork of their leaders , Salzman said . 
`` I think the tribal elders would have to meet from different tribes and agree on some kind of structure , '' Salzman said . 
The problem , said Salzman , may lie in divisions between East and West that sprouted in Roman times with the carving of Libya into three states : Tripolitania in the west , Cyrenaica in the east and Fezzan in the south . 
The states and the tribes that lived in each remained independent until 1931 when Italian colonizers put down a rebellion with brute force and unified Libya again . 
But the nation was split again when Italy was defeated in World War II -- Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were controlled by the British and Fezza , by the French . 
A unified and independent Libya emerged in 1951 but the east-west tribal divisions remained deep , said St. John , because the king , a scholar of religion from the east , showed little interest in running his country . 
`` King Idris was a poor monarch , '' St. John said . 
`` He was disinterested in government . 
He was a religious scholar interested in tribal affairs . 
The eastern tribes benefited from Idris more so than the western tribes . '' 
Gadhafi always saw the tribes in eastern Libya as natural opponents , St. John said . 
Now , with the Libyan crisis sliding closer to war , the embattled leader is sure to see other tribes in the same vein . 
For now , several tribes in the west and south are reportedly loyal to Gadhafi , among them Gadhafi 's own tribe and the Magariha , the tribe of the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi . 
But the powerful Warfallah have already defected as have the Zintan , one of the first towns in western Libya that revolted last month . 
In a recent speech delivered on state television , Gadhafi 's son Saif a-Islam Gadhafi , blamed Libya 's unrest on tribal factions and warned of civil war with members of different tribes `` killing each other in the streets '' . 
But when they rose up to fight their Italian colonizers , Libya 's tribes stood as one against a common enemy . 
Gadhafi 's foes are hoping for that unity again . 
A November 18 , 1922 , New York Times story began this way : `` The latest to enter the Near Eastern struggle are the Bedouins of Tripolitania and Ceryainica , who are reported to have sunk their local differences and united ... to expel the Italians and establish their own government . '' 
The article went went on to raise speculation on how long the tribes , who have fought each other for generations , could stay united to fight someone else . 
Almost a century later , the same question seems eerily relevant .

2011-03-04,"By Pam Benson , Jeniffer Rizzo and Adam Levine , CNN Rebel fighters shoot into the air during a funeral for slain comrades in Ajdabiya , Libya . 
Gadhafi military units are defecting , says a U.S. official Aiding the opposition is complicated Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anti-Gadhafi fighters appear to have the resources to carry on the fight against the Libyan government for some time , according to a U.S. official . 
`` This could be a sustained conflict , '' said the official , but acknowledged this was a fluid situation . 
When asked if the conflict in Libya was now becoming a civil war , the official , who is knowledgeable about U.S. assessments , said the fighting `` has the characteristics of a civil war . '' 
The anti-government forces are bolstered by some weapon caches previously under the control of the Libyan government , according to a U.S. official and military officials not authorized to speak on the record . 
Defectors from the Libyan military are helping the rebels with fighting and armaments . 
`` Whole units of the Libyan army have now defected '' said a military official . 
That said , the United States does not have a good read yet on how much of the Libyan military leader Moammar Gadhafi still may control . 
When asked about what the anti-government forces had in their control , one of the military officials said they have tanks and anti-aircraft guns . 
Some of this , of course , comes from defecting units , but there also has been captures of weapons caches , the officials said . 
There are large caches of weapons around the country that the official said are no longer secure . 
Rebels have been seen with shoulder-fired missiles , anti-tank missiles and small-arms such as rocket-propelled grenades . 
The prospect of a civil war could dampen the will of the United States and other countries to intervene directly in the country . 
American officials have expressed caution regarding military intervention , stressing the need for humanitarian aid first . 
President Barack Obama said Thursday he wanted to ensure the United States was ready to respond , if `` defenseless civilians were finding themselves trapped and in grave danger . '' 
Aiding the opposition is also complicated , officials said , because of the lack of clarity about the capability , motives and strength of the disparate groups comprising the opposition . 
White House and State Department officials said Friday that even though the opposition is arming itself and fighting the government , that does not entitle Gadhafi to fight his own people . 
Gadhafi , officials said , lost his legitimacy when his forces fired on innocent protesters . 
`` It is the people of Libya that are forced to defend themselves in light of the aggression that the Libyan regime has carried on , not just a military forces , but by these mercenaries that are in the employment of Colonel Gadhafi , '' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said . 
`` The unrest is aimed at ending his rule , his oppressive and violent rule , and we believe that that would result in a more peaceful Libya and would allow the Libyan people to take the kind of steps that they want to take towards a representative democratic government that addresses their legitimate grievances and respects their aspirations , '' said White House spokesman Jay Carney . 
Earlier in the week , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the situation demands `` a strong and strategic American response . '' 
`` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy , or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos . 
The stakes are high , '' said Clinton . 
Libya being in a civil war would `` neither enhance or diminish your right as a third party actor to intervene , '' but the foremost consideration needs to be whether Gadhafi is needlessly cruel to the people of Libya , said Ruth Wedgwood , professor at Johns Hopkins School of International Advanced Studies . 
`` Can a government defend itself ? 
Yes , '' Wedgwood said . 
`` Can a government use means that are grotesquely excessive ? 
No. '' CNN 's Barbara Starr contributed to this report .

2011-03-04,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : `` They never were in control '' of Zawiya , a rebel soldier says A doctor reports casualties in Zawiya ; `` indescribable '' violence , a witness says Tear gas and rubber bullets are used in Tripoli , witnesses say Forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi clash with fighters in eastern Libya Are you in there ? 
Show CNN what 's happening . 
Please do not put yourself in a dangerous situation . 
Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Indescribable '' violence rippled through the Libyan city of Zawiya on Friday , according to a witness who said pro-government forces gunned down peaceful protesters there . 
The witness said battalions of forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi attacked protesters with mortars and machine guns as they were demonstrating in the city 's Martyrs Square , and they assaulted an ambulance , killing its occupants . 
`` We buried nine people so far , '' the witness said . 
`` The attack was indescribable . 
Direct gunfire was opened on people . '' 
It was unclear who controlled the city . 
John McCain pushes Libya no-fly zone People in Zawiya , west of Tripoli , and `` their public leadership have secured and took control over the city from the armed terrorist elements , '' state TV reported . 
Libyan government spokesman Majid al - Dursi told CNN that `` Zawiya has been captured , Zawiya has been liberated . '' 
However , the witness said protesters retained some control inside the city , which security forces were surrounding . 
`` They -LRB- Gadhafi 's forces -RRB- have n't been in control and they never were in control , '' said one rebel fighter , who said his forces lost seven men in fighting in Zawiya on Friday , versus what he said were some 20 casualties among government fighters . 
Referring to Gadhafi , he said , `` All the man has left is his lies . '' 
By late Friday , the situation was quiet , he said . 
`` However , we 're surrounded by three areas -- the east , the west and the south . '' 
At least 15 people died and 200 others were wounded in the city , according to one doctor , who said there was `` a river of blood '' at the hospital where the wounded were being treated . 
`` The situation is very bad , '' he said , adding that the facility was short of medical supplies . 
It was not clear if the casualties at the hospital were wounded during the Martyrs Square confrontation . 
The doctor said the wounded started arriving at the hospital Friday morning , and most of the wounds were from gunshots . 
In the capital city of Tripoli , security forces aboard flatbed trucks shot tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of protesters who had formed after Friday prayers in the Tajura neighborhood , witnesses said . 
Government officials would not allow CNN into Tajura , whose outskirts were patrolled by a heavy security presence . 
Security forces were searching cars along the Corniche , a main street in the city . 
Tired , filthy and stuck at border Who is the opposition in Libya ? 
Witnesses said anti-government protesters hid journalists in abandoned buildings and helped move them from location to location so that they could report firsthand in safety . 
Near Green Square , in the center of the city , anti-government protesters emerged from a mosque to find pro-government supporters outside . 
Police intervened and fired shots in the air to head off a confrontation , ushering the anti-government protesters back into the mosque for their safety . 
In the eastern city of Ras Lanuf , meanwhile , forces loyal to Gadhafi fought with opposition members Friday , opposition fighters and commanders said . 
Thuds could be heard in the distance , indicating heavy fighting around the city itself . 
`` It 's a war , '' said CNN 's Ben Wedeman , in Ras Lanuf . 
`` The protests are now over . '' 
He described seeing truckloads of people `` organizing themselves in a rather haphazard way '' and headed toward the front with no command-and-control structure . 
`` It 's complete chaos , really , '' Wedeman said . 
Such clashes have spurred throngs of people to flee the country . 
The number of people trying to leave the country has declined in recent days , however , as heavily armed government forces have intensified their presence at the Tunisian border and on roads leading up to it , the United Nations refugee agency said Friday . 
`` We are concerned that the presence of the forces and the large drop in evacuees could mean that people are being prevented from leaving , '' said Sybella Wilkes , a spokeswoman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees . 
Roughly 15,000 people had been crossing the border every day , but that number plunged to fewer than 2,000 per day on Thursday and Friday . 
In all , 200,000 people have fled Libya , according to the International Organization for Migration , which has been working with the U.N. refugee agency on mass evacuations . 
Meanwhile , a doctor on the northwestern town of Misrata said it was attacked by forces loyal to Gadhafi . 
The assailants fired at doctors and ambulances , the doctor said . 
`` We are holding our city , we are trying to protect our city , '' the doctor told CNN Friday morning . 
`` We are doing our job in the hospital and trying to treat everybody . 
This morning , they shot at our ambulances . 
One of them exploded ... they shot at our doctors . '' 
At least 40 people were killed in the city and 300 wounded , the doctor said . 
While CNN has staff in some cities , the network can not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya . 
CNN has gathered information through telephone interviews with witnesses . 
Musa Ibrahim , a spokesman for Gadhafi 's regime , has denied reports of attacks on peaceful protesters and military installations . 
In an interview late Friday , Gadhafi 's son Saif Gadhafi told CNN that reforms will not begin until `` militias '' in the east have been defeated . 
He called international efforts to persuade his father to give up power `` a big mistake , '' and said his father remains a popular figure in the country . 
`` Even if we were to hold tomorrow an election , my father would win with a big majority , '' he said . 
Gadhafi 's aerial attacks have prompted the West to step up discussions about imposing a no-fly zone over the country . 
U.S. military and diplomatic officials have said enacting a no-fly zone would be complicated and risky , and international support is not strong . 
`` If it 's ordered , we can do it , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier this week , but imposing a no-fly zone `` begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses . '' 
The United States is exploring a `` full range '' of options , Obama said Thursday . 
Analysts said the Iraq war has prompted nations to be more cautious . 
`` We went into Iraq with a very dubious understanding of the situation on the ground , '' Christopher Hill , a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq , told CNN . 
`` So I think there is some concern about whether refugee reports are entirely accurate in a sort of macro sense . '' 
He added , `` I think what the president is trying to do is to try to build diplomatic support and see where we can go with this . 
And I think it would be highly problematic if he just jumped into something . '' 
The Arab League has rejected international intervention , saying Libya is facing `` an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments . '' 
But the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue , said Hisham Yousef , chief of staff of the Arab League . 
The protests have left more than 1,000 people dead and many more injured , according to the United Nations . 
Libya 's ambassador to the United States has estimated that the death toll was about 2,000 . 
The United Nations has proved to be a sore point for the Libyan government . 
On Friday , the United Nations said it was studying Libya 's request to install a more loyal diplomat as its ambassador . 
A letter from Libya 's government asked that former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki be approved as its envoy . 
Treki would replace Mohamed Shalgham as ambassador in New York . 
Shalgham and his deputy , Ibrahim Dabbashi , have denounced Gadhafi and requested that he stop leading Libya . 
A separate letter from Libya to the United Nations demanded that Shalgham and Dabbashi be denied the right to speak for Libya . 
In emotional scenes last week , the New York-based ambassadors were hugged by fellow ambassadors after the Libyans criticized Gadhafi and pleaded in the Security Council chamber for international assistance to the country . 
U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said the situation `` is complicated '' and that the world body 's legal office was looking into the dueling diplomats ' situation . 
The International Criminal Court said Thursday that Gadhafi and some of his sons and advisers are under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity . 
Venezuela 's president has said Gadhafi is receptive to the idea of an international commission coming to the country . 
The two heads of state spoke this week . 
`` I consulted with him . 
I asked him if he was willing to accept a commission of countries , '' Hugo Chavez said on state-run VTV Thursday night .

Subject : URGENT OPEN LETTER TO BAN KI-MOON , UN SECRETARY GENERAL Date : Sat , 5 Mar 2011 14:30:12 +1100 I urge you , that either you or the UN or the Prosecutor of the International Court of Justice issue a warning ASAP to Gaddafi 's pilots and army that they will be individually held responsible for any civilian deaths and charged with crimes against humanity . 
Secondly , a no fly zone over Libya should be declared ASAP . 
Gaddafi has all the money in the world to finance mercenary armies and pilots as China and India are continuing importing Libyan oil , with payments going to Gaddafi 's regime . 
Thirdly , the UN should resolve to send in UN troops to Libya to stop the civil war and to allow the people of Libya to decide their own future . 
The world ca n't just stand by when there is a totally unequal David and Goliath struggle unfolding in Libya between the rag-tag army of revolutionaries and Gaddafi 's well equipped professional killers . 
It 's the duty of the world to prevent the massacre of the civilian freedom fighters of Libya , as it happened in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution . 
There too , the revolution started as a peaceful demonstration against the tyrannical regime . 
People only took up arms there too after State Security Police shot at them . 
The revolutionaries held out for over a week , but the overwhelming force of the invading Soviet army , comparable to Gaddafi 's reliance on external professional mercenaries , squashed the revolution , killing over 2500 freedom fighters .

2011-03-04,"By the CNN Wire Staff The U.S. government has sent two C-130 cargo planes to Tunisia The airplanes have supplies meant to help with the humanitarian crisis in Libya U.S. authorities are considering multiple ways to help , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says Sen. John McCain is among those pushing to create a no-fly zone in Libya Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. government stepped up its humanitarian relief effort for Libya on Friday , sending two C-130 military transport planes loaded with supplies to neighboring Tunisia . 
Each aircraft carried three pallets of aid supplies , including 2,000 blankets , 40 rolls of plastic sheeting and 9,600 10-liter water cans , according to a statement from the U.S. Agency for International Development . 
The supplies , meant to help up to 2,000 people , will be handed off to Tunisia 's Red Crescent organization for distribution , the statement noted . 
The relief operation -- designed to help those who have fled the Libyan violence -- is named Odyssey Dawn , Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said . 
Tired , filthy and stuck at border Who is the opposition in Libya ? 
American authorities are considering multiple ways to assist in the crisis , but are currently focused primarily on humanitarian efforts , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters . 
The Obama administration remains deeply `` concerned with the ongoing violence ... initiated and perpetrated '' by the government of Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi , she said . 
Clinton noted , however , that there is currently `` a lot of confusion on the ground '' in Libya that makes it tough to understand exactly what is happening there . 
Addressing reporters on Air Force One , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated the administration 's position that Gadhafi needs to step aside . 
`` Col. Gadhafi has no legitimacy and should step down and should cease all violence , '' Carney said . 
`` We believe that that would result in a more peaceful Libya . '' 
The violence in Libya escalated Friday as pro-government forces took control of Zawiya , a city near Tripoli , according to state TV . 
One source reported the deaths of 15 people and injuries to at least 200 others . 
A doctor at a hospital in Zawiya told CNN `` there is a river of blood '' where the wounded were being treated . 
He described the situation as `` very bad , '' with the facility running out of medical supplies . 
Forces loyal to Gadhafi also clashed Friday with opponents of the regime in the eastern city of Ras Lanuf , opposition fighters and commanders said . 
Roughly 200,000 people have fled the intensifying violence in Libya , according to the International Organization for Migration . 
The number of people trying to leave , however , has declined heavily as armed government forces have intensified their presence on the Tunisian border and on roads leading up to it , the United Nations refugee agency has noted . 
A number of key congressional leaders have been pressuring the White House to establish a no-fly zone over parts of Libya to aid Gadhafi 's opponents and ease the humanitarian crisis . 
Gadhafi 's `` air defense systems are certainly old and it -LRB- should not be -RRB- a major challenge ... to impose a no-fly zone , '' Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , asserted Friday . 
While the administration has shifted additional military resources closer to Libya , it has refused to commit to such a course of action so far .

2011-03-04,"WRAPUP 9-Libyan forces fight for town in west , rebels in east \* Gaddafi forces recapture much of Zawiyah near Tripoli \* Rebels say take Ras Lanuf \* Government forces bomb Benghazi arms depot , rebels say -LRB- Recasts with fighting in Zawiyah , Ras Lanuf , Benghazi bombing -RRB- AJDABIYAH , Libya , March 4 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi 's forces fought their way into a rebel-held western town on Friday , but rebels said they had captured the eastern oil town of Ras Lanuf , extending their hold on eastern Libya . 
The fighting appeared to confirm the division of the vast desert oil-producing state between a western area round the capital Tripoli held by forces loyal to Gaddafi and an eastern region held by those rebelling against his four-decade rule . 
In Zawiyah , a town 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli whose control by the rebels had embarrassed the government , `` dozens were killed and more were wounded , '' by pro-Gaddafi forces , said Mohamed , a resident . 
`` We have counted 30 dead civilians . '' 
The loyalist forces used grenade-launchers , heavy machineguns and snipers on the roof of a new hotel to fire at protesters when they marched after Friday prayers to demand the fall of the regime , Mohamed said . 
An improvised rebel force had withdrawn to the central Martyrs Square , and government troops were 4-5 kilometres away , a rebel spokesman said . 
A Libyan government official said of the town : `` It 's been liberated , maybe there are still some pockets -LRB- under rebel control -RRB- but otherwise it 's been liberated . '' 
In the east , rebels said their forces had taken the oil town of Ras Lanuf , which lies on a strategic coastal road , hours after saying they had captured the town 's airport . 
Rebels have already seized control of much of the rest of eastern Libya , the main oil-producing part of the country , in a popular uprising centred on Benghazi , Libya 's second city . 
A rebel spokesman said pro-Gaddafi forces bombed an arms depot -- one of the biggest weapons depots in the region -- on the outskirts of Benghazi on Friday . 
`` A lot of people have been killed . 
There are many people in the hospital . 
No one can approach , it 's still very dangerous , '' said a resident who would only identify himself as Saleh . 
Security forces had cordoned off the area , and a Reuters witness said at least eight ambulances were seen ferrying casualties from the scene . 
Windows were shattered in suburbs several kilometres from the scene , residents said . 
The uprising against Gaddafi is the bloodiest yet against a long-serving ruler in the Arab world , and follows the ousting in the past weeks of the long-time presidents of both Tunisia and Egypt -- Libya 's western and eastern neighbors . 
The cut in Libya 's 1.6 million barrel per day oil output -- caused partly by the flight of thousands of key foreign oil workers -- is a major blow to its economy . 
News of the fighting pushed up U.S. crude prices to their highest levels since September 2008 , and Brent crude futures for April delivery LCOc1 rose $ 1.36 to $ 116.17 a barrel . 
The International Energy Agency said one million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libya 's oil output was shut , the top of the range it had estimated on Wednesday . 
-LRB- ID : nWEB3662 -RRB- The upheaval has caused a humanitarian emergency on the Tunisian border where tens of thousands of foreign workers have fled to safety . 
An international airlift is under way , reducing the number of refugees stranded in tented camps . 
The rebels earlier told Reuters they were open to talks only about Gaddafi 's exile or resignation , following attacks on civilians that have provoked international condemnation , arms and economic sanctions and a war crimes probe . 
`` Victory or death ... We will not stop until we liberate all this country , '' Mustafa Abdel Jalil , head of the rebel National Libyan Council told supporters of the two-week-old uprising . 
Western nations have called on Gaddafi to go and are considering various options including the imposition of a no-fly zone , but are wary about any offensive military involvement . 
In Tripoli , shooting rang out across Tajoura district as Gaddafi loyalists broke up a crowd of protesters seeking an end to his long rule and shouting `` Gaddafi is the enemy of God ! '' 
The demonstrators spilled out of the Murat Adha mosque after Friday prayers , and several hundred began chanting for an end to Gaddafi 's four decades in power . 
Up to 100 people in Tripoli had been arrested , accused of helping the rebels , Al Jazeera said . 
Earlier on Friday , rebel volunteers said a rocket attack by a government warplane just missed a rebel-held military base which houses an arsenal in the eastern town of Ajdabiyah . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Some Libyan bloggers are wondering if the Central banks will be able to cover withdrawals by citizens now that Libyan overseas assets have been frozen . 
And this question is on the minds of many who are more concerned about the humanitarian crisis developing there rather than the eventual political outcome , oil prices or power play . 
Can someone enlighten this uninformed reader ? 
I am appalled at the lack of action by the West . 
Is it not possible to at least provide shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles , and other weapons . 
We encourage the Libyans to further democracy , and then do nothing to support them .

When journalists including Reuters reporters tried to walk out of the gates of the main media hotel , to the south of Tripoli city center , security guards blocked their way . 
A Libyan government spokesman said journalists were being kept in the Rixos hotel because their presence could trigger violence from what he described as affiliates of al Qaeda . 
`` These are exceptional circumstances . 
I know you 're going to talk about it and twist it the way you want , '' said the spokesman Mussa Ibrahim . 
`` We are preparing to pay this price of preventing you guys from reporting to avoid turning Tripoli into Baghdad . '' 
A revolt against Gaddafi 's four-decade rule has left the eastern side of the country , and several towns elsewhere , in rebel control with the capital now his principal strong-hold . 
Several residents of Tripoli have said they are planning to protest against Gaddafi when they leave their mosques after Friday prayers , and that they anticipate a violent crackdown by armed pro-Gaddafi militias . 
Overnight , gunshots could be heard outside the Rixos hotel . 
Ibrahim said the firing was an attempt by the rebels to disturb stability in central Tripoli . 
About 130 journalists are in the hotel after being invited to Libya on an officially-organized media visit . 
Their movements are monitored by officials .

NEW : Two planes headed for Cairo take off from Djerba , Tunisia NEW : A total of 132 Egyptians are on board Italian cargo planes deliver humanitarian aid Many people are afraid to flee because of the fighting Djerba , Tunisia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. military planes headed for Cairo took off from Tunisia Saturday , evacuating Egyptians fleeing the Libyan conflict , a deadly war spurring a massive refugee flight . 
Two Marine planes left the airport in the Tunisian island of Djerba with a total of 132 Egyptians on board , the U.S. State Department said . 
Two additional Air Force C-130s are en route to Djerba and will take another group of Egyptians home . 
All four U.S. planes are expected to arrive in Cairo by Saturday night , U.S. officials said . 
Two Italian military cargo planes landed at the Djerba airport delivering humanitarian aid . 
There are at least 10 other evacuation flights scheduled for Saturday -- six British , three Spanish and one Italian -- said Firas Kayal , a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency . 
Nine of the flights are to evacuate Egyptians and the other is for Malians . 
There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home . 
Kayal said there are also three ships preparing to evacuate people . 
The violence in Libya has generated an exodus out of the North African nation . 
Almost 200,000 people , a majority of them foreign workers , have fled Libya -- nearly 100,000 to Tunisia and a similar number to Egypt -- according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees . 
The numbers of people entering Tunisia daily from Libya dropped to 1,800 Thursday and Friday and stood at 3,000 Saturday . 
Previously , they averaged 10,000 to 15,000 people . 
Hovig Etyemezian , a field officer for the U.N. refugee agency , attributed the drop in part to fear and the manipulation of the flow of refugees by Libyan authorities . 
`` A lot of them were scared from leaving because of the fighting so they were staying in their houses , '' he said Saturday . 
`` We fear the regime might be blocking refugees from the border . '' 
A Sudanese man who crossed into Tunisia said Libyans had been confiscating phones and SIM cards of people fleeing . 
He said people are afraid to make the journey because of the fighting and the cost for bus or taxi transport to the border has spiked . 
However , he said , Libyans are not stopping traffic toward border . 
Raoul Gernali , a Filipino engineer who had been working on a Libyan water project , said Libyan soldiers at the Tunisian border stole his laptop , money and mobile phone . 
Because of complications with his group 's flight home , he and his Filipino colleagues have had to spend three days at the airport . 
Many countries , such as India and China , put in place well-organized evacuation operations for their citizens . 
But others , including Egyptians and Bangladeshis , have been left to fend for themselves . 
The U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa , South Asia and Southeast Asia . 
Kayal said more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia . 
Many Bangladeshis have had to walk to the border because their money was stolen by soldiers and they could not pay for transportation costs . 
One man suffered a heart attack and died , aid officials confirmed .

2011-03-05,"By the CNN Wire Staff Moammar Gadhafi 's son speaks with CNN NEW : Heavy , sustained gunfire is heard in the capital city of Tripoli Gadhafi 's foes announce the formation of body to represent Libya Opposition members in the east say a military plane was shot down Almost 200,000 people have fled the situation in Libya Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Heavy , sustained gunfire rang out in the Libyan capital of Tripoli early Sunday morning as unrest in the country entered a 20th day . 
On Saturday , Libyan opposition leaders announced an alternative government as the United States and other countries helped evacuate refugees of the conflict . 
Anti-government forces also claimed two major successes Saturday : preventing pro-government forces from taking the city of Zawiya , near the capital of Tripoli , and capturing the strategic eastern oil town of Ras Lanuf . 
The opposition and government forces have battled in recent days for full control of Zawiya , about 30 miles west of Tripoli . 
Forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi withdrew from the city 's Martyrs ' Square and returned to their positions on the outskirts after intense clashes with rebels , according to a witness who is serving as a rebel spokesman . 
Volunteers arm for Libya conflict Libya weapons available on black market He reported heavy gunfire and mortar shelling and saw the bodies of three slain opposition members carried in the square en route to burial . 
The witness said pro-Gadhafi forces entered a residential area in the city and shot live ammunition and automatic weapons at residents in the streets . 
The sounds of automatic weapon fire and people yelling could be heard during a telephone interview with the witness . 
After a lull in fighting , clashes erupted again Saturday evening . 
The pro-Gadhafi security forces are using tanks , armed vehicles , and heavy weapons , and the anti-Gadhafi forces are well-armed , a second witness said . 
Many deaths and injuries have occurred in the latest round of fighting , and protesters managed to seize tanks and weapons from the security forces . 
Saturday , rebels also captured the strategic oil port of Ras Lanuf , a day after pro-Gadhafi forces fought with opposition members there , fighters and commanders said . 
The development appeared to embolden opposition members , who prepared to advance west to Gadhafi 's birthplace of Sirte . 
Government forces , however , worked to thwart their push . 
CNN reporters following the movement of rebels in As Sidr , just west of Ras Lanuf , saw an air force helicopter pound opposition positions . 
There was no word on casualties . 
Rebels near Ras Lanuf said they shot down a Libyan air force plane , a Soviet-made Sukhoi Su-24MK that crashed in the desert . 
CNN located the plane 's debris , spread over a kilometer -LRB- about half a mile -RRB- , with the headless bodies of two pilots at the site . 
The plane was printed with the emblem of the Libyan Arab Air Force . 
In the capital , a pro-democracy activist who spoke to CNN described a city filled with tension and mistrust . 
The woman , who asked not to be named because of fears for her safety , said she has seen people in the streets who , she believes , are monitoring residents ' comings and goings and phone conversations . 
`` I see cars that have people inside them , and they are usually connected with a computer , '' the woman said , adding that special antennae are connected to the computers . 
The same people are also interrupting cell phone signals and hacking mobiles , she said , and the internet has been unavailable since Thursday . 
The family 's business has been robbed , with millions of dollars ' worth of materials stolen , she said . 
Squatters have also moved into one of the family 's homes . 
`` The police wo n't do anything about it , '' she told CNN . 
`` Everyone is focusing on what is going on politically and losing focus on the crime . '' 
The woman said she has been trying to smuggle medication and other supplies into Libya , and that 's one reason she refuses to leave -- even though so far , she said her efforts have been unsuccessful . 
The strife engulfing the besieged north African nation is reverberating across the country , the region and the world . 
Death toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . 
The government has been reviled across the globe for violence against civilians , and the International Criminal Court this week launched an investigation of Gadhafi , some of his sons and other leaders for possible crimes against humanity . 
Opposition-controlled radio announced Saturday that the country 's sole legitimate representative was now the National Transitional Council , a group with 31 representatives for most of the regions in Libya . 
The council held its first meeting Saturday in the eastern city of Benghazi . 
They called Benghazi their temporary location until the `` liberation '' of the capital , according to a decree the council issued late in the day . 
Former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdeljeleel , whom the council said had tried to resign from Gadhafi 's government several times , was announced as the council 's new leader . 
The council also named a representative for military affairs and established a military council to oversee the `` liberation '' of Libya and reconstruct the armed forces , according to the radio announcement . 
The council said its main missions are to represent all of Libya internationally , liberate the country , draft a constitution and hold elections . 
In Benghazi , witnesses said forces loyal to Gadhafi pounded a weapons depot , an airstrike that caused casualties and widespread damage . 
One witness said the airstrike there was powerful enough `` to destroy a whole city . '' 
News footage showed the remains of buildings and debris and ambulances arriving . 
Such aerial attacks have prompted the West to step up discussions about imposing a no-fly zone over Libya . 
U.S. military and diplomatic officials have said such a zone would be complicated and risky , and international support for it is not strong . 
`` If it 's ordered , we can do it , '' U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier this week , but imposing a no-fly zone `` begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses . '' 
The Arab League has rejected international intervention , saying Libya is facing `` an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments . '' 
However , the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue , said Hisham Yousef , chief of staff of the Arab League , on Wednesday . 
The fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . 
Almost 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the United Nations refugee agency said . 
The United States announced Saturday it is contributing $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration to help return home thousands of non-Libyans who fled to Tunisia . 
Four U.S. military flights Saturday were taking a total of 312 Egyptians back to Cairo , the U.S. State Department announced . 
Thursday and Friday , about 1,800 people crossed from Libya to Tunisia , and about 3,000 crossed on Saturday , said Firas Kayal , spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees . 
He said the situation at the border is `` very calm . '' 
A few thousand Egyptians are in Tunisia awaiting travel home , and more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are there awaiting evacuation with hundreds more still arriving , Kayal said . 
The agency confirmed that a Bangladeshi migrant worker died after a heart attack from the exhaustion of walking to the border . 
Many migrant workers told aid workers they had to walk to the border because soldiers took their money and they could n't afford paying for a taxi .

2011-03-05,"U.N. estimates 172,000 people have fled Libya Most of them are migrants returning home 10,000 are expected to leave daily , a Tunisian airport official says Djerba , Tunisia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The evacuation of the tens of thousands of refugees who have streamed across the Libyan border to Tunisia has stepped up dramatically . 
Tunisian authorities have established an air bridge from a provincial airport on the island of Djerba that is now moving out thousands of migrants a day . 
`` We are expecting 10,000 passengers to leave every day with 66 movements , that 's to say 66 planes , '' said Djerba airport director Zouhaier Badreddine told CNN . 
`` The majority go to Egypt . 
But there are also Chinese , Pakistanis , Filipinos , Bangladeshi , Vietnamese , Turks in the beginning but now they all seem to have left . 
There are many nationalities and many destinations . '' 
15 reported killed in Zawiya , Libya ` Awful ' conditions along Libyan border No-fly zone in Libya explained Tired , filthy and stuck at border As of Thursday , more than 172,000 people had left Libya , most of them migrant workers returning home , the U.N. 's emergency relief coordinator , Valerie Amos , said in a statement issued Friday . 
Among them were women and children , she said . 
The United Nations ' figure was slightly less than that of the International Organization for Migration , which has been working with the U.N. refugee agency and estimated that 200,000 people had fled Libya . 
Some of those crossing the border told CNN that government forces in Tripoli had confiscated their mobile phones and cameras . 
A majority of those fleeing are Egyptians who had been working in Libya . 
But the foreign workers also include citizens of other nations including Bangladesh , Thailand , Vietnam , Sudan , Ghana and Mali . 
A U.S. Agency for International Development official said approximately 90,000 people were in transit camps over the Libyan border in Tunisia . 
Almost half of them are Egyptian , said the official , who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record . 
Closer to the Egyptian border , in the eastern city of Benghazi , about 8,000 foreigners awaited evacuation . 
They included Eritreans , Ethiopians and Somalis , according to the refugee agency . 
`` They appear to have gathered spontaneously and are camping together for security as they await , '' refugee agency spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in a statement . 
She said most of those people will be evacuated within two days . 
Who is the opposition in Libya ? 
Refugees flee Libya for Tunisia Another 110,000 people inside Libya have been affected by the crisis , the International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday . 
It appealed for $ 26 million to help those inside the country and those in Tunisia . 
The agency said it will use the money for food , water , medical care , sanitation and hygiene items . 
As the violence has escalated in the past few days , U.S. military aircraft and French charter jets have scrambled to evacuate tens of thousands from the north African nation . 
In Washington , President Barack Obama said he has approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help Egyptians who have fled the unrest to return home . 
He said he authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter additional planes . 
`` Tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing Libya , and we commend the governments of Tunisia and Egypt for their response , even as they go through their own political transitions , '' Obama said . 
The Pentagon announced that two planes carrying humanitarian supplies were being dispatched Friday to Tunisia in what has been dubbed Operation Odyssey Dawn ; the planes were carrying blankets , rolls of sheeting and water cans . 
CNN learned that a C-130 cargo plane labeled with a U.S. flag landed in Tunisia . 
Badreddine stood in the departure hall of an airport that normally welcomes sun-hungry European tourists traveling to the wind-swept beaches of Djerba 's Mediterranean coast . 
Instead , the hall was filled with hundreds of tired and dirty migrant workers . 
Some camped out on the floor on blankets . 
Others stood in orderly lines in front of a booth normally reserved for car rental companies and money exchange , which instead held Tunisian volunteers distributing sandwiches , fruit and water to the arrivals . 
`` Of the 50,000 refugees who have come through here '' since the crisis began , Badreddine said , `` everybody has been given shelter and food at the airport . '' 
The conditions at the airport were dramatically better than the scene that awaited many migrants immediately after entering Tunisia from Libya . 
On Thursday , more than 5,000 Bangladeshi men were camped out in a vacant lot next to the border gate , huddled under blankets next to a fetid pond of muddy water as howling winds whipped dust through the compound . 
Tunisian authorities and volunteers distributed food and water . 
A tent city that serves as a transit center was erected this week some 10 kilometers from the border . 
But the camp can hold only some 15,000 people -- that 's how many people are estimated to have arrived in a single day and not near enough to accommodate all those in need . 
Still , conditions have improved dramatically since Wednesday , when Libyan authorities began regulating the flow of refugees across the border . 
Instead of allowing them to mass by the thousands in front of the Tunisian border gate , refugees must now approach the border with Tunisia in orderly groups in single file . 
The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that the number of civilians fleeing the violence in Libya to Tunisia `` has dropped significantly since Wednesday afternoon , '' with armed , pro-government forces manning the Libyan side . 
Compared with earlier in the week , when 10,000 to 15,000 people were crossing daily into Tunisia , fewer than 2,000 made it across on Thursday and about the same number did so on Friday , the agency said . 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it was `` very concerned that the security situation in Libya may be preventing people from fleeing . '' 
The Libyan government appeared eager to show off the orderly border . 
Officials bused in a group of foreign journalists from Tripoli Thursday afternoon as part of a guided tour of the frontier region . 
But , upon their arrival in Egypt , dozens of refugees have said they had been robbed at Libyan checkpoints . 
Many said that , as they sought to get out of Libya , they were stopped and searched by Libyan security forces who confiscated their cell phones and computers . 
Many refugees also accused Libyan police and soldiers of having robbed them at gunpoint . 
`` I have no passport , only a passport photocopy , '' said Mohammed Shafiq al Islam . 
The 29-year-old man sat on the floor of the airport with more than 100 Bangladeshis -- all of them awaiting a flight home . 
He wore a uniform labeled `` Hanil , '' the name of the supply company that paid him $ 250 a month to work in Libya . 
`` The Libyan people take my money and passport and all the time say ' I will kill you , I will kill you , ' '' al Islam said , speaking in broken English . 
`` I am run away -LRB- for -RRB- my life . '' 
Like many Bangladeshi migrant workers , al Islam had borrowed some $ 4,000 to pay employment agencies to give him a job in Libya . 
Upon their arrival in Libya , many migrant workers were forced to hand over their passports to their employers . 
Human rights groups have denounced such practices , arguing they amount to little more than indentured servitude . 
The flight back to Bangladesh for al Islam and his fellow migrants will be free , but he and many of his fellow Bangladeshis face crushing debts . 
`` We are very helpless now ; we are beggars now , '' al Islam said . 
Djerba airport officials said 25 flights were scheduled to take off Friday for Cairo . 
The French government has helped with the Egyptian airlift by chartering several passenger planes to Cairo . 
A number of charter flights are scheduled as well to India , Jordan , China , Vietnam and Dubai .

The first of the C-130 cargo planes landed in Cairo at about 3 p.m. Sunday , carrying 82 passengers , the U.S. embassy in Cairo reported . 
Two more planes were en route with 90 and 72 passengers , respectively . 
The fourth plane was yet to depart from Tunisia . 
On Saturday , U.S. military planes carried out similar evacuations , returning passengers to Egypt . 
There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home , said Firas Kayal , a spokesman for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , on Saturday . 
Many countries , such as India , conducted well-organized evacuation operations for their citizens . 
Nearly 36,000 Chinese nationals , for instance , have been evacuated from Libya since February 22 -- the largest such effort in the Communist state 's 61-year history , the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Sunday . 
The last 149 of those evacuees touched down in Shanghai late Saturday , having arrived back in China after a stop in Malta , according a statement from China 's foreign ministry . 
Beijing coordinated evacuations using 91 China-based charter flights , 35 rental charter flights from non-Chinese airlines , 12 flights on military airplanes , 11 non-Chinese passenger ships , five cargo ferries and one escort ship , in addition to 100 bus runs , Xinhua reports . 
But people from other countries , including Egyptians and Bangladeshis , have been left to fend for themselves . 
Kayal said Saturday more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia . 
Many of them have had to walk to the border because their money was stolen by soldiers and they could not pay for transportation costs . 
One man suffered a heart attack and died , aid officials confirmed . 
On Sunday , the British government said it would provide emergency evacuation flights to repatriate 500 stranded Bangladeshis . 
Three commercial charter planes will take the Bangladeshis home from Djerba airport later Sunday , the British government said . 
`` I have seen for myself the scale of the humanitarian situation on the Libyan border with Tunisia , '' said Andrew Mitchell , the international development secretary . 
`` I vowed that we would do everything possible to give those stranded shelter and get them back home as quickly as possible . '' 
Meanwhile , three people died and 14 were missing when they tried to get off a ship headed from Libya 's capital , Tripoli , to Crete , the Greek Ministry for the Protection of Civilians said Sunday . 
The ship -- flying under Cyprus ' flag -- was carrying about 1,280 passengers , mostly Bangladeshis . 
The ministry said passengers were killed or went missing as they were trying to get off the ship using a rope . 
Nigeria 's National Emergency Management Agency announced Sunday that 1,243 Nigerians `` who had been stranded in Tripoli '' arrived in Nigeria . 
In total , nearly 2,300 Nigerians have been evacuated , the agency 's director general , Muhammad Sani-Sidi , said in a statement . 
The operation has involved large chartered planes and commercial aircraft , the statement said . 
The violence in Libya has generated an exodus from the north African nation . 
Almost 200,000 people , a majority of them foreign workers , have fled Libya -- nearly 100,000 to Tunisia and a similar number to Egypt -- according to the United Nations refugee agency . 
The numbers of people entering Tunisia daily from Libya dropped to 1,800 Thursday and Friday and stood at 3,000 Saturday . 
Previously , they averaged 10,000 to 15,000 people . 
Hovig Etyemezian , a field officer for the U.N. refugee agency , attributed the drop in part to fear and the manipulation of the flow of refugees by Libyan authorities .

2011-03-06,"Libya crisis sends U.S. gas prices up 33 cents in two weeks March 06 , 2011 | By Mariano Castillo , CNN The national average for a price of self-serve unleaded gasoline at $ 3.51 , says the Lundberg Survey . 
U.S. gasoline prices increased nearly 33 cents in two weeks , the second-biggest two-week jump in the history of the gasoline market , according to a new survey of filling stations . 
The latest Lundberg Survey of cities in the continental United States was conducted Friday . 
It showed the national average for a price of self-serve unleaded gasoline at $ 3.51 , an increase of 32.7 cents from the last survey two weeks earlier , survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said . 
The jump was the biggest since a 38-cent hike between August and September 2005 . 
At the time , the price increase was driven by damage caused by Hurricane Katrina . 
`` This time around , the spike comes not from nature , but from people , '' Lundberg said . 
`` The armed struggle in Libya has shocked international oil markets and here it is at the pump . '' 
As the fighting between opposition forces and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's troops begins to look more like a civil war , expect prices to continue to rise , she said . 
Prices have risen nearly 82 cents since September 2010 , the survey found . 
While Libya is not among the top suppliers of U.S. oil , and only 3 % of Libyan oil exports head to the United States , global economics link the events there to the pumps at home . 
Libya produces a light , high-gravity crude oil that is most in demand by less complex refineries around the world , Lundberg said . 
As this oil becomes unavailable , it forces buyers of crude to substitute crude with similar properties from other oil producers , thereby increasing demand and starting a chain reaction that raises prices of crude and gasoline in the United States . 
The current average price of $ 3.51 is 61 cents below the all-time high price recorded in July 2008 . 
Today 's price is 78 cents higher than a year ago , Lundberg said . 
On a side note , Lundberg noted that the rising gas prices could dampen the nation 's economic recovery . 
Gas demand -- one of the reflections of the American economy -- has been growing at a rate of 1 % , she said . 
`` Higher prices today are certainly capable of halting that gasoline demand growth , which would reflect bad news in the economy , '' she said . 
The Lundberg Survey sampled prices at about 2,500 gas stations . 
Of the cities surveyed , the highest average price in the continental United States was in San Diego at $ 3.87 per gallon . 
The lowest price was in Billings , Montana , at $ 3.15 . 
California has garnered headlines lately for its high gas prices , though the average price in the state remained below $ 4 , at $ 3.83 per gallon for regular gas . 
The average California price for premium does break that barrier , at $ 4.04 per gallon .

2011-03-06,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : The UN 's chief talks Sunday with Libya 's foreign minister , urging end to violence A doctor says at least 42 were killed in Misrata ; the UN says aid has been blocked Libyan state TV says troops are under orders not to enter cities controlled by `` gangs '' Police search cars to make sure no anti-Gadhafi forces come out in Tripoli , a witness says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Opposition forces claimed a major victory Sunday in Libya , managing to block an onslaught by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's troops and maintain control of the key city of Misrata , an eyewitness said . 
Using machine guns , sticks and anything else they could find , crowds protected the courthouse , serving as an operations center by the opposition in Misrata , and successfully repelled Gadhafi militias armed with tanks and heavy artillery , the witness said . 
`` The will and the determination and dedication that people are showing here on the ground , it just makes you speechless , '' he said . 
A doctor at Central Misrata Hospital said 42 people were killed -- 17 from the opposition and 25 from the pro-Gadhafi forces -- and that 85 people were wounded in the fighting , which continued on the city 's outskirts . 
The youngest victim , 3 years old , was killed by direct fire , the doctor said . 
Witnesses and other sources are not being named for their own safety . 
Humanitarian and medical aid to the central Libyan city has been blocked , U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in a statement Sunday . 
She urged authorities `` to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives . '' 
Fighting also raged in the town of Bin Jawad , where the sounds of booms -- either aerial bombardments or heavy artillery -- could be heard echoing . 
The opposition also worked to keep control of Ras Lanuf . 
Thousands trying to leave Libya Opposition at work in Benghazi The young and inexperienced go to war The battles came in stark contrast to the image Gadhafi 's regime sought to portray in the capital , Tripoli . 
Throngs filled Green Square , cheering their support of Gadhafi , with some insisting they were celebrating the government 's victory in Misrata . 
A government official said Gadhafi 's regime was victorious in Ras Lanuf and in Zawiya , as well . 
CNN was not allowed to enter Zawiya on Sunday , and could not reach people inside the city . 
Reports said communications had been cut off . 
Libyan state TV also claimed that the government had gained control of the eastern port city of Tobruk . 
`` Morning victory , oh people of Libya . 
Victory city of Tobruk from terrorist gangs , '' the station said . 
Witnesses in Tobruk , though , said it was still under opposition control . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon talked Sunday morning with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kasa , appealing for an end to hostilities and discussing `` the increasingly troubling humanitarian situation , '' according to a statement from his office . 
The release criticized Gadhafi 's government for what it called `` disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets . '' 
After reports of the opposition successfully fighting off pro-Gadhafi forces in Misrata , Libyan state TV showed a graphic -- in both Arabic and English -- saying that `` strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs , who took civilians as human shields and threatened to slaughter the inhabitants of those cities . '' 
The report cited `` military sources , '' and said those cities `` are being circled by the armed forces except those neighborhoods where the terrorist gangs have sought refuge . '' 
While the pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli was crowded and boisterous -- including the sounds of car horns and celebratory gunfire -- such demonstrations do not offer a clear sign of how much support the 68-year-old leader actually has . 
Throughout the uprising , which began February 15 , witnesses in Tripoli have described the government using all sorts of methods to drum up crowds , including forcibly dragging people to them , while keeping anti-Gadhafi demonstrators off the streets . 
On Sunday , police forces searched cars to try to ensure that no anti-Gadhafi protesters were out on the streets , though some still managed to venture out , a witness said . 
Traces of bullets and blood could be seen in some districts near Tripoli 's Green Square , and people were mopping the streets and cleaning the walls , the witness said . 
On Saturday , opposition forces had claimed two major successes : preventing pro-government forces from taking Zawiya and capturing Ras Lanuf along the coast . 
Opposition forces in eastern Libya briefly detained a group of British special forces . 
The group was let go Sunday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement . 
`` I can confirm that a small British diplomatic team has been in Benghazi . 
The team went to Libya to initiate contacts with the opposition . 
They experienced difficulties , which have now been satisfactorily resolved . 
They have now left Libya , '' Hague said in a statement . 
`` We intend , in consultation with the opposition , to send a further team to strengthen our dialogue in due course . 
This diplomatic effort is part of the UK 's wider work on Libya , including our ongoing humanitarian support . 
We continue to press for Gadhafi to step down and we will work with the international community to support the legitimate ambitions of the Libyan people . '' 
The strife engulfing the north African nation is reverberating across the country , the region and the world . 
Death toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . 
The protesters are seeking the ouster of Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of ruling the country -- the kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . 
But unlike in those countries , the uprising has turned into warfare . 
Benjamin Barber , a fellow at the New York-based Demos think tank who had worked closely with the Gadhafi Foundation , told CNN 's Fareed Zakaria that he felt Gadhafi , his son Saif and their supporters would likely `` fight to the death '' -- meaning a prolonged war , compared to the relatively quick and peaceful political transition that happened in Egypt and Tunisia . 
Even if Gadhafi is somehow ousted , Barber predicted the violence could continue as tribes duke it out for supremacy in a nation that has few significant public institutions that could fill a potentially chaotic void . 
Gadhafi 's government has been reviled across the globe for violence against civilians , and the International Criminal Court has launched an investigation of Gadhafi , some of his sons and other leaders for possible crimes against humanity . 
Opposition-controlled radio announced Saturday that the country 's sole legitimate representative was now the National Transitional Council , a group with 31 representatives for most of the regions in Libya . 
The council held its first meeting Saturday in the eastern city of Benghazi . 
It called Benghazi its temporary location until the `` liberation '' of the capital , according to a decree the council issued . 
Former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdeljeleel , whom the council said had tried to resign from Gadhafi 's government several times , was announced as the council 's new leader . 
The council also named a representative for military affairs and established a military council to oversee the `` liberation '' of Libya and reconstruct the armed forces , according to the radio announcement . 
The council said its main missions are to represent all of Libya internationally , liberate the country , draft a constitution and hold elections . 
Meanwhile , the fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . 
Almost 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the United Nations refugee agency said . 
The United States announced Saturday it is contributing $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration to help return home thousands of non-Libyans who fled to Tunisia .

Full Article Gaddafi launches counter-offensive on Libya rebels TRIPOLI | Sun Mar 6 , 2011 11:56 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched counter-offensives against rebel-held towns on Sunday , increasing fears that Libya is heading for a protracted civil war rather than the swift revolutions seen in Tunisia and Egypt . 
The Gaddafi government proclaimed sweeping overnight victories over what it called terrorist bands . 
But after what residents said was a day of fierce fighting with artillery , rockets and mortar bombs , rebel forces announced they had fought off Gaddafi 's forces in the towns of Zawiyah and Misrata to the immediate west and to the east of Tripoli . 
`` We would like to put the people of this great nation at ease ... because the regime is spreading rumors , '' opposition rebel council spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told a Benghazi news conference . 
`` Both Zawya and Misrata are secured , liberated cities . '' 
Gaddafi 's troops , backed by tanks , artillery , warplanes and helicopters also attacked positions near the oil port of Ras Lanuf , 660 km -LRB- 410 miles -RRB- east of the capital . 
Misrata , with a population of 300,000 , is the largest town controlled by rebels outside the rebel-held east of the country . 
If rebel soldiers were able to continue their fitful advance westwards , Misrata could be a stepping stone to reaching the capital , Gaddafi 's principal stronghold . 
Loyalists had poured into the streets of Tripoli at dawn on Sunday firing into the air and holding portraits of the leader who has headed the OPEC oil and gas producer for 41 years . 
`` These are celebrations because government forces have taken control of all areas to Benghazi and are in the process of taking control of Benghazi , '' spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said , referring to Libya 's second city , situated in the far east . 
But the celebrations appeared to be premature as Benghazi remained firmly under rebel control and insurgents at Zawiyah and Misrata said they had repulsed assaults and were now fighting to take back the town of Bin Jawad , west of Ras Lanuf . 
Government troops pushed the insurgents out of Bin Jawad which they had captured on Saturday . 
But the rebels regrouped around Ras Lanuf and moved back to the outskirts of Bin Jawad , a small , dusty town sandwiched between the coastal highway and the Mediterranean Sea , 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte . 
One fighter returning wounded to Ras Lanuf from the government assault on Bin Jawad was asked what he had seen . 
`` Death , '' he replied , too distraught to say any more . 
Rebels surrounded by troops near the center of Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , faced another attack after repelling two assaults by tanks and infantry the day before . 
`` This morning , there was a new attack , bigger than yesterday . 
There were one and a half hours of fighting ... Two people were killed from our side and many more injured , '' spokesman Youssef Shagan said by telephone . 
`` We are still in full control of the square , '' he added . 
Elite brigades under Gaddafi 's son Khamis also launched an assault on Misrata , 200 km -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- east of the capital . 
`` The brigades tried to reach the center of the town but revolutionaries managed to repel them . 
They retreated to the airbase , '' said a resident who declined to be named . 
`` The revolutionaries captured 20 soldiers and seized a tank . 
The town is now fully in the control of the youths , '' he said . 
At least 18 people , including a baby , were killed in the fighting in Misrata on Sunday , a doctor told Reuters by phone . 
`` We have 18 martyrs but the figure is not final . 
We also have many people wounded , I can not even count them , '' said the doctor , who works at Misrata main hospital , adding that the dead included rebels and civilians . 
Rebels first took Bin Jawad on Saturday , but later withdrew . 
Army units then occupied local homes and set up sniper and rocket-propelled grenade positions for an ambush . 
`` It 's real fierce fighting , like Vietnam , '' rebel fighter Ali Othman told Reuters . 
`` Every kind of weapon is being used . 
We 've retreated from an ambush and we are going to regroup . '' 
When the rebels returned , a fierce exchange of rockets and mortar bombs ensued just outside Bin Jawad with the army also using heavy artillery . 
Behind rebel lines , hundreds of fighters armed with machine guns and assault rifles waited to advance . 
`` The firing is sustained , there is the thud of shells landing , the whoosh of rockets , puffs of smoke and heavy machine gun fire in the distance , '' a Reuters correspondent there said . 
The rebels said they had shot down a helicopter on Sunday and Reuters was shown the wreckage of a warplane on Saturday near Ras Lanuf that rebels said they had brought down . 
Doctors at Ras Lanuf hospital said two dead and 22 wounded had arrived from the fighting . 
A French journalist was shot in the leg , a doctor said , and four rebels were seriously wounded and unlikely to survive . 
Britain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday that what he called a British diplomatic team that had been captured in the eastern city of Benghazi have now left Libya . 
The Sunday Times earlier reported a British Special Air Service -LRB- SAS -RRB- unit had been captured after a secret diplomatic mission to make contact with opposition leaders backfired . 
`` They -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- did capture some British special forces . 
They could not ascertain if they were friends or foes . 
For our safety we are holding them and we expect this situation to be resolved soon , '' a rebel source in Benghazi said . 
Western leaders have denounced what they call Gaddafi 's brutal response to the uprising , and the International Criminal Court said he and his inner circle face investigation for alleged targeting of civilians by his security forces . 
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a newspaper on Sunday that the United Nations security council should launch fresh sanctions against Gaddafi . 
`` Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people , '' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper . 
`` The flow of money must be cut off . '' 
The International Energy Agency said the revolt had blocked about 60 percent of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd oil output . 
The drop , due largely to the flight of thousands of foreign oil workers , will batter the economy and have already jacked up crude prices abroad .

2011-03-06,"BERLIN , March 6 | Sun Mar 6 , 2011 11:25 am EST BERLIN , March 6 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United Nations security council should launch fresh sanctions against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a newspaper on Sunday . 
`` Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people , '' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper . 
`` The flow of money must be cut off . ''

2011-03-07,"Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf Monday , launching aerial strikes as part of an assault aimed at crushing the uprising against him . 
At the end of the third week of unrest -- protests began February 15 -- Gadhafi 's aerial forces targeted the main road heading into the oil town after launching another air strike earlier , five kilometers southeast of the city . 
In what has turned into a civil war , members of the opposition fired anti-aircraft guns toward Gadhafi 's planes . 
Some families fled Ras Lanuf , hoping to escape the violence that has engulfed some of the country 's most populous areas . 
Meanwhile , U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said `` there are credible reports of the use of helicopter gunships against civilians by government forces . '' 
Three members of the U.N. Security Council -- France , Britain , and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya , diplomatic sources at the United Nations said . 
But any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China , two permanent members of the council that wield veto power . 
U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he had a `` very clear message to those who are around Col. Gadhafi : It is their choice to make how they operate moving forward and they will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there . '' 
`` We 've got NATO as we speak consulting in Brussels around a wide range of potential options , including potential military options , in response to the violence that continues to take place inside Libya , '' he said . 
In a statement , NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said NATO did not intend to intervene in Libya , but `` as a defense Alliance and a security organization , it is our job to conduct prudent planning for any eventuality . '' 
NATO has begun around-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya , as it considers options for dealing with the Libyan violence , U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told reporters Monday . 
While the opposition has managed to fight off onslaughts by Gadhafi 's forces in some places -- including what a witness described as an `` amazing '' victory against Gadhafi 's heavy artillery Sunday in the town of Misrata -- the regime has advanced as well . 
Gadhafi 's forces seemed to make headway in the city of Bin Jawad , where the Libyan army appeared to have control Monday after fighting over the weekend .

Check out CNN 's reporting around Libya , city by city . 
On Monday , air strikes continued to target the opposition-controlled oil town of Ras Lanuf as Gadhafi supporters tried to take back the city . 
CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman was just outside Ras Lanuf and heard someone say , `` We 'll capture -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , put him on top of this car and drive all around Libya . 
Every Libyan will get one shot -LRB- at the leader -RRB- . '' 
Wedeman was one of the first journalists inside the country when the protests began , and he reports on who will be fighting in the conflict . 
CNN 's Nic Robertson reports that fighting is getting closer to the Libyan capital of Tripoli . 
Also Monday , as several families in Ras Lanuf fled for cover , Gadhafi 's forces made headway in the city of Bin Jawad , which was hotly fought over during the weekend . 
Anti-government protesters have been rallying for weeks in the hopes that Gadhafi , who has ruled the country for 42 years , will leave power . 
Similar uprisings occurred earlier this year in Egypt and Tunisia , and other protests have raged throughout the Middle East and North Africa as demonstrators have called for changes in leadership and power structures in their countries .

Other critics of the hearings include music mogul Russell Simmons . 
The topic is sure to remain hot all week as CNN covers every angle of the debate . 
Rep. Peter King , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , called the for hearings on what is being called `` the radicalization of American Muslims . '' 
Critics say the hearings would unfairly target Islam and could stoke fear and fuel violence against Muslims . 
King and Rep. Keith Ellison , who is the first Muslim elected to Congress , talked about the reasons for the hearings on CNN on Sunday with Candy Crowley .

2011-03-07,"A rebel runs for cover during a government airstrike in the area of Ras Lanuf , Libya , on Monday . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman recounts moments before , after air strikes in area of Ras Lanuf , Libya Wedeman : Journalists in hotel awakened early Monday amid fear of government attack CNN crew drove within eyesight of what probably was Libyan army Editor 's note : CNN 's Ben Wedeman filed this first-person account of the scene in rebel-controlled Ras Lanuf , Libya , as Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces prepared to launch an aerial strike against the town Monday . 
Ras Lanuf , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Down ! 
the man at my hotel room door said . 
It was 4:30 a.m. Monday in Ras Lanuf , and I had hoped to get a decent night 's sleep for the first time in weeks . 
Yet again , my hopes were dashed . 
Through the haze of sleep deprivation and exhaustion , I could say nothing . 
The staff of the Fadeel Hotel was going from room to room , telling guests -- journalists only -- that they had to leave , at once . 
I quickly dressed , packed my bag , and went downstairs . 
It was still pitch black outside , and the lobby was teeming with still photographers , cameramen , translators , fixers , producers and print and TV reporters , all trying to understand why the urgent need to leave . 
Libya conflict moves closer to capital The young and inexperienced go to war Opposition at work in Benghazi Thousands trying to leave Libya There were plenty of rumors , and no facts . 
Gadhafi is using poison gas ! '' 
one of the fighters told me . 
`` The army is coming here , they 'll be here soon , '' said another . 
`` You must go now , '' the hotel manager told me . 
`` It 's not safe in Ras Lanuf . '' 
The television in the lobby was tuned to the Arabic satellite news channel Al-Arabiya , which was flashing that Libyan government forces had taken up defensive positions around Ras Lanuf , which had been taken over by anti-Qaddafi rebels two days before . 
The rebels had advanced beyond Ras Lanuf , by about 30 kilometers , to the town of Bin Jawad , but were pushed out within hours . 
Their advance westward , begun in the refinery town of Al-Brega , had come to a screeching halt . 
And now it was beginning to look as if the tide was turning . 
As we waited in the lobby , I had visions of the Libyan army pulling up outside the hotel , rounding us all up and taking us back to Tripoli , hands bound and blindfolded , to be put on trial . 
Libyan state television had announced that all journalists who had entered the country from Egypt without visas would be considered outlaws and , worse , collaborators with al Qaeda . 
As the first Western television journalist to enter Libya from Egypt during the current crisis , I had reliable information I was high on Tripoli 's wanted list . 
I watched as the Ras Lanuf press corps bundled into cars , or onto the back of pickup trucks , and drove away in the dark . 
We decided to wait until first light before moving . 
In the meantime , the hotel staff was removing the big flat-screen TV in the lobby , and desktop computers and printers from behind the reception desk and back offices . 
After the other journalists had left , the cleaning staff -- migrant workers from Bangladesh -- cleared away dozens of paper coffee cups , mopped the floor and emptied ashtrays overflowing with the butts of dozens of jumpy journalists . 
When it became light , instead of going east -- away from the supposedly advancing Libyan army -- we and a crew from the BBC went west , toward Bin Jawad , to see if there was any truth to the claims Gadhafi 's men were on the move . 
Libya witness : Rockets on the ground Searching the Gadhafi family tree We drove slowly , stopping regularly to survey the terrain , to ask any fighters along the way about what they had seen and what they knew about the front lines . 
The few we met assured us the government forces were still on the outskirts of Bin Jawad and were n't moving forward . 
It was disconcerting , however , that as we continued to drive , there was almost no one to speak with . 
The usual gatherings of boisterous , friendly rebel fighters gathered around cars , pickup trucks and Chinese - and Soviet-made anti-aircraft guns were nowhere to be seen . 
The road was almost empty . 
We stopped one last time about five kilometers east of Bin Jawad . 
Three kilometers away we could see something blocking the road . 
The BBC crew , who had a bigger and better camera , went a bit further to get a better look , but after about five minutes came racing back , lights flashing . 
Meanwhile , we heard a jet overhead . 
We 'd had two close misses with bombs a few days before , so we jumped to the side of the road , ready to lie flat in the sand in case they bombed again . 
In the distance we heard the loud , hollow pop of anti-aircraft fire . 
The plane flew in a wide arch twice above us , but dropped no bombs . 
When it flew on , we regrouped with the BBC crew , who recounted that while videotaping down the road , a shot had been fired over their heads . 
The cameraman said he saw in his viewfinder vehicles pointing east toward Ras Lanuf , and men who were all wearing identical uniforms . 
That did n't sound like the motley opposition forces . 
And if they had been opposition forces , they would have opened fire with everything they had on the jet above . 
But they did n't . 
In other words , those dots down the road were probably soldiers from the Libyan Army . 
Driving back toward Ras Lanuf , we saw a huge plume of black smoke and brown dust a few kilometers up ahead . 
Libyan Air Force jets were attempting to bomb rebel targets again . 
It was just one of many such air strikes in the area Monday . 
Along the main Benghazi-Tripoli road that skirts Ras Lanuf , we found groups of opposition fighters chanting and joking about Gadhafi `` the dog , '' Gadhafi `` the donkey , '' but it was beginning to all ring hollow . 
There seemed to be less of them about , and fewer and fewer appeared to be moving to the front . 
We returned to the hotel in mid-afternoon . 
It was open again , but the staff had fled . 
The new `` staff '' was comprised of men and teenagers with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades . 
They were going from room to room , turning on the TVs , using the bathrooms , calling to their friends from the balconies . 
In the parking lot outside , they regularly fired rounds from their automatic weapons . 
Although I did n't see it , a print reporter friend told me they had spent much of the afternoon smoking hashish . 
To borrow a line from one of my old scripts , `` morale is high , and so are the troops . '' 
In the coffee shop , more fighters were crowded behind the bar , helping themselves to whatever was available , handing out bowls of cornflakes with milk and chocolate syrup . 
Pickup trucks had pulled up in front of the hotel , and they were loading them with food and crockery from the kitchen . 
Theoretically , I suppose , they were commandeering supplies for opposition forces in the area . 
All the while , they were eager to reassure the few journalists who had returned in the hopes of spending another night in the Fadeel Hotel that all was well , that they would be safe , that they would sleep soundly . 
The more insistent their reassurances , however , the more tenuous the prospect of a night at the hotel became . 
The thought of stoned adolescents armed to the teeth stumbling around the halls at night , in addition to the very real possibility of a nighttime assault by the Libyan army on Ras Lanuf , was more than even the most battle-hardened war correspondents cared to ponder . 
The CNN crew was among the last guests to leave the hotel just after sunset . 
There was no need to settle the bill or return the keys .

2011-03-07,"CAIRO | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 6:56 pm EST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - One of Muammar Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said on Monday his father had not yet thrown his army into full battle against rebels , saving it to shield Libya against foreign attack , and civil war could erupt if he did . 
In an interview with Al Arabiya television , Saadi Gaddafi also said the Libyan leader could not resign as demanded by the rebels because that could also lead to civil war . 
Saadi blamed some of the unrest on one of his brothers , Saif al-Islam , who he said had sought economic reforms but failed to address the problems of ordinary Libyans . 
`` The tribes are all armed , there are forces from the Libyan army and the eastern region is armed . 
The situation is not like Tunisia or Egypt , '' said Saadi , who was briefly a professional footballer in Italy before turning to business . 
Protests in Tunisia and Egypt have toppled the presidents of both countries since the start of the year . 
`` The situation is very dangerous , '' he said . 
The leader must play a very , very big role in calming Libya and convincing people to sit together . 
`` If something happened to the leader , who would be in control ? 
A civil war would start . '' 
He said the Libyan army had so far only intervened to protect `` sensitive sites '' and a wider war would result if his father ordered them into an all-out fight . 
`` The leader has given special instructions to the army not to intervene , save for the protection of sensitive sites , and to be ready to repel foreign intervention . '' 
The military was just waiting for Gaddafi 's orders , Saadi said . 
`` So far it has not moved . 
When it does , a civil war may erupt , '' he said in the full broadcast of the interview , which Al Arabiya had excerpted earlier in the day . 
The news channel said that Saadi Gaddafi warned that Libya would turn into a new Somalia and that tribes would fight against each other . 
He said Tripoli was holding a dialogue through the tribes to answer the demands of the people , without making clear which demands he was referring to . 
`` But there are armed groups that pursue the path of killing and violence , which I think leaves only the choice of confronting them , '' he added . 
Saadi 's criticism of his brother Saif al-Islam hinted at strains within the Gaddafi family as the unrest continued . 
`` The leader told them -LRB- Saif al-Islam and the ministers -RRB- on a daily basis that you are facilitating matters and the budget , but there are things they did not do . '' 
Those shortcomings included failing to address issues like prices of basic commodities that concerned Libyans , Saadi said . 
The reforming efforts of Saif al-Islam were stymied by opposition from inside the ruling elite and , some analysts had said , family members . 
Educated at a British university , Saif al-Islam has acted a spokesman for his father during the unrest . 
Saadi had a brief career in Italy 's Serie A soccer league between 2003 and 2007 , though he had little time on the field . 
Saadi , who qualified as an engineer and also holds military rank , later turned to business . 
He told Reuters in an interview last year he was behind a project to set up a free trade zone on the Mediterranean coast west of Tripoli . 
When violence engulfed Libya 's eastern city of Benghazi in mid-February , Saadi spoke on local radio to say he had been appointed commandant of the city . 
Soon after , residents took control of Benghazi and forced out Gaddafi 's forces .

2011-03-07,"Gold near record , silver at 31-year peak on Libya SINGAPORE | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 8:20 am IST SINGAPORE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Gold rose to near a record high and silver jumped to its highest in more than three decades on Monday on inflation worries triggered by rising oil prices as widening clashes in Libya deepened fears the country was on the brink of a civil war . 
Troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched counter-offensives against rebel-held towns on Sunday , increasing fears that Libya is heading for a civil war rather than the swift revolutions seen in Tunisia and Egypt , sending U.S. crude to its strongest in more than two years . 
Spot gold added $ 2.50 an ounce to $ 1,434.45 an ounce by 0209 GMT , within sight of a record high struck last week of $ 1,440.10 -- the level which has become a key resistance . 
`` If we do see tension escalating further , then we could witness a new high in gold . 
Besides Libya , I think investors will also be looking at other countries within the Middle East . 
The example will be Saudi Arabia , '' said Ong Yi Ling , investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore . 
Saudi Arabia 's council of senior clerics issued a statement on Sunday forbidding public protests , which the rulers of the U.S. ally and key oil exporter fear could spread following demonstrations by minority Shi'ites . 
The kingdom has escaped major protests like those which toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia , but the wave of unrest has reached its neighbors Yemen , Bahrain , Jordan and Oman . 
`` With gold prices moving up , silver will be poised for leverage gains . 
I think a little bit of economic optimism will be boosting silver . 
In a short-term , I would say that silver may outperform gold , '' said Ong . 
Silver was steady after rising as high as $ 36.14 an ounce , partly driven by data showing a rebound in U.S. jobs and some physical buying by China . 
The closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday showed an increase of 192,000 jobs as private employers hired 222,000 workers , the most since April . 
That took the jobless rate down to a nearly two-year low of 8.9 percent . 
U.S. gold futures for April rose $ 5.7 an ounce to $ 1,434.3 an ounce . 
Gold should push higher from its near-record levels due to its appeal as a safe haven , while iron ore should regain its upward momentum on the back of red-hot industrial demand from Asia , forecasters told the world 's largest mining conference on Sunday . 
In Japan , the Japanese retail price for gold rose to a 28-year high above 4,000 yen -LRB- $ 48.60 -RRB- per gram on Monday as the dollar gold market neared its lifetime peak . 
The physical market was muted , but dealers expected demand from top consumer India to pick up during the wedding season . 
`` We are seeing a two-way business here , but it 's hard to single out any particular country . 
The same goes to silver . 
There 's good silver buying from China , '' said a physical dealer in Singapore . 
The high-demand wedding season is underway in India , but jewellers are likely waiting to see if prices decline , Ong said . 
Jewellery is the most common gift during religious events and weddings in India . 
`` I would think with prices so high , then the physical side would n't be so strong . 
They will be waiting for prices , perhaps , to come down to about $ 1,400 level before they buy on dips , '' said Ong of Phillip Futures . 
In other markets , the dollar struggled against a basket of major currencies early in Asia on Monday after failing to get a boost from the non-farm data , while the euro stayed supported on expectations of an interest rate hike next month . 
The Nikkei slipped 1.2 percent on Monday , handing back most of last week 's gains , as fears of more turmoil in the Middle East and higher oil prices overshadowed solid U.S. payroll data .

2011-03-07,"TRIPOLI | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 4:49 am IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched counter-offensives against rebel-held towns on Sunday , increasing fears that Libya is heading for a civil war rather than the swift revolutions seen in Tunisia and Egypt . 
The Gaddafi government proclaimed sweeping overnight victories over what it called terrorist bands . 
But after what residents said was a day of fierce fighting with artillery , rockets and mortar bombs , rebel forces announced they had fought off Gaddafi 's forces in the towns of Zawiyah , to the immediate west of Tripoli , and Misrata to the east . 
`` Today Misrata witnessed the toughest battle since the beginning of the revolution . 
Horrible attacks , '' one resident , who did not want to give his name , told Reuters by phone . 
`` They came from three sides and managed to enter the town from the west and south but when they reached the center of Misrata the rebels pushed them back , '' he said . 
Misrata , with a population of 300,000 , is the largest town controlled by rebels outside the rebel-held east of the country . 
If rebel soldiers were able to continue their fitful advance westwards , Misrata could be a stepping stone to reaching the capital , Gaddafi 's principal stronghold . 
Rebel council spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told a Benghazi news conference : `` We would like to put the people of this great nation at ease ... because the regime is spreading rumors . 
`` Both Zawiyah and Misrata are secured , liberated cities . '' 
Gaddafi 's troops , backed by tanks , artillery , warplanes and helicopters attacked positions near the oil port of Ras Lanuf , 660 km -LRB- 410 miles -RRB- east of the capital . 
Rebels were forced to retreat from Bin Jawad which is on the road to Sirte , the hometown of Gaddafi who has ruled the OPEC oil and gas producer for 41 years . 
`` Gaddafi 's cut us to pieces . 
He 's firing on us with tanks and missiles . 
I do n't know what we 're going to do now , '' Momen Mohammed told Reuters . 
One fighter returning wounded to Ras Lanuf from Bin Jawad was asked what he had seen . 
`` Death , '' he replied , too distraught to say any more . 
Rebels said they planned another attack on Bin Jawad , which is only 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- from Sirte , on Monday morning . 
Rebel commanders told Reuters Gaddafi 's forces were reinforcing Sirte where they had more than 20,000 fighters . 
They said the city houses the Saadi -LRB- a son of Gaddafi -RRB- battalion which includes four brigades , as well as armed tribe members . 
Loyalists had poured into the streets of Tripoli at dawn on Sunday firing into the air and holding portraits of Gaddafi . 
`` These are celebrations because government forces have taken control of all areas to Benghazi and are in the process of taking control of Benghazi , '' spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said , referring to Libya 's second city , situated in the far east . 
But the celebrations appeared to be premature as Benghazi remained firmly under rebel control while insurgents stood their ground at Zawiyah and Misrata . 
Rebels surrounded by troops near the center of Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , faced another attack after repelling two assaults by tanks and infantry the day before . 
`` This morning , there was a new attack , bigger than yesterday . 
There were one and a half hours of fighting ... Two people were killed from our side and many more injured , '' spokesman Youssef Shagan said by telephone . 
Elite brigades under Gaddafi 's son Khamis also launched an assault on Misrata , 200 km -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- east of the capital . 
`` The brigades tried to reach the center of the town but revolutionaries managed to repel them . 
They retreated to the airbase , '' said a resident who declined to be named . 
`` The revolutionaries captured 20 soldiers and seized a tank . 
The town is now fully in the control of the youths , '' he said . 
At least 18 people , including a baby , were killed in the fighting in Misrata on Sunday , a doctor told Reuters by phone . 
`` We have 18 martyrs but the figure is not final . 
We also have many people wounded , I can not even count them , '' said the doctor , who works at Misrata main hospital , adding that the dead included rebels and civilians . 
Doctors at Ras Lanuf hospital said two dead and 22 wounded had arrived from the fighting . 
A French journalist was shot in the leg , a doctor said , and four rebels were seriously wounded and unlikely to survive . 
Britain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday that what he called a British diplomatic team that had been captured in the eastern city of Benghazi had now left Libya . 
The Sunday Times earlier reported a British Special Air Service -LRB- SAS -RRB- unit had been captured during a secret diplomatic mission to make contact with opposition leaders backfired . 
`` They -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- did capture some British special forces . 
They could not ascertain if they were friends or foes . 
For our safety we are holding them and we expect this situation to be resolved soon , '' a rebel source in Benghazi said earlier . 
Western leaders have denounced what they call Gaddafi 's brutal response to the uprising , and the International Criminal Court said he and his inner circle face investigation for alleged targeting of civilians by his security forces . 
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a newspaper on Sunday that the United Nations security council should launch fresh sanctions against Gaddafi . 
`` Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people , '' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper . 
`` The flow of money must be cut off . '' 
The International Energy Agency said the revolt had blocked about 60 percent of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd oil output . 
The drop , due largely to the flight of thousands of foreign oil workers , will batter the economy and have already jacked up crude prices abroad .

2011-03-07,"ROME | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 6:19 am EST ROME -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italy , which did more than any other country to legitimize Libya and its mercurial leader , is going through a foreign policy nightmare as civil strife in its former colony threatens its energy supplies , international image and the stability of some of its blue chip companies . 
`` The stakes for our country are very high , '' said Roberto Aliboni , vice-president of Italy 's Institute for International Affairs , who argued in a recent report that Italy should take a clear stand against Gaddafi and invest in the opposition . 
But Rome is moving cautiously , realizing it has the most to lose among European nations as events unfold in the North African nation just 300 miles from Italy 's southernmost island . 
Six months ago Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and other officials fawned over Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , treating him like royalty on his third visit to Italy in two years . 
Now , a 2008 `` friendship treaty '' that prohibited Italian bases from being used in any military action against Libya has been officially `` suspended '' while Italy seems to be grabbing at straws over what policy to take with Libya . 
The numbers tell the story . 
Italy imports about 80 percent of its energy needs . 
About 32 percent of Libya 's oil output goes to Italy -- making up about 25 percent of Italy 's imports -- and about 12 percent of Italy 's gas comes from Libya . 
Under the friendship treaty , Italy promised to pay Libya $ 5 billion in compensation over 25 years for colonial misdeeds . 
Libya has been spending petrodollars on stakes in Italian companies while Italian firms have won infrastructure and energy contracts in the country it ruled as a colony from 1911 to 1943 . 
The web of commercial interests includes banking , textiles , cars , construction , railways , aerospace -- and soccer clubs . 
Rome was de facto guarantor of Tripoli 's good behavior when Libya was warily welcomed back into the international community after renouncing terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . 
While leaders such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton dutifully went to Tripoli and appeared uneasy with Gaddafi , Italy pulled out all the stops and Berlusconi embraced him as `` my great friend . '' 
Gian Antonio Stella , a commentator for the Corriere della Sera newspaper , argued that Italy has to feel more responsible for a positive outcome to the Libyan crisis because Rome `` revered and adulated '' Gaddafi until only a short while ago . 
When the Libyan unrest broke out Berlusconi seemed almost in denial , perhaps sensing that his one-on-one style of diplomatic relations had fallen flat , as Gaddafi returned to his old habit of insulting the former colonial power . 
`` In Gaddafi 's case this -LRB- Berlusconi 's personal style produced results that were grotesque and undignified , '' wrote political commentator and former ambassador Sergio Romano . 
`` We had to put up with the capriciousness of the colonel , his delays -LRB- in 2009 he failed to show up to address parliament -RRB- his insults , his uniforms , his tents in our parks , '' Romano said . 
Rome 's behavior can have far-reaching effects for Italy . 
`` Political imprudence by the government can risk unleashing resentment from whatever Libya emerges from the current crisis , '' said Aliboni of the Institute for International Affairs . 
`` National interests would be gravely put at risk . '' 
It is no surprise that Italy is no cheerleader for sanctions against Libya or of calls for the freezing of its assets or the imposition of a no-fly zone . 
Rome has made clear that it is not considering unilaterally freezing Libyan holdings in Italian companies at present . 
Libya owns stakes in blue-chip Italian companies including bank UniCredit and defense company Finmeccanica , and the fate of its holdings have been under scrutiny since the European Union imposed sanctions on Libya . 
The EU agreed last week to freeze the assets of Gaddafi and a list of senior Libyan officials after Libyan security forces used violence to crack down on protesters . 
But since that list does not mention the country 's sovereign wealth fund , the Libyan Investment Authority -LRB- LIA -RRB- , or the Libyan central bank -- entities that hold stakes in Italian companies -- Italy does not plan to freeze the holdings , a source familiar with the matter told Reuters . 
The question is where do the assets of Gaddafi and his family end and where do Libya 's assets begin . 
`` The problem is that in an authoritarian regime today , just like in the absolute monarchies of the medieval times , it is hard to distinguish between the personal goods of the sovereign and those of the state , '' said commentator Stefano Lepri in La Stampa newspaper . 
Other European countries have been more aggressive in their pursuit of assets linked to Gaddafi and his top aides . 
British publisher Pearson Plc last week said the LIA 's 3.2 percent stake in the company had been frozen because of the sanctions , while Austria has widened an asset freeze list to include a top official at the LIA . 
Also making Italy 's position with Libya difficult is the prospect of a wave of illegal immigration , worse than the one that hit it in the early 1990s after the collapse of communism in Albania . 
`` The contrast between the moral imperative -LRB- to support democracy -RRB- and the political dividend is particularly stark because of the fear of the consequences the fall of Gaddafi 's regime could have on migration , '' said Emanuela Paoletti of the International Migration Institute at Oxford University . 
In 2009 , Rome and Tripoli signed a deal allowing Italy 's coastguard to return boatloads of illegal immigrants to Libya Before then , Libya was a main staging post for illegal immigration from Africa and Gaddafi has made it clear that he could let the genie out of the bottle again if he wanted . 
He told France 's Journal du Dimanche on Sunday that if he fell `` you will have immigration , thousands of people from Libya will invade Europe . 
There will be no one to stop them any more . ''

2011-03-07,"Civil war in Libya if Gaddafi quits , son tells TV CAIRO , March 7 | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 1:46 pm EST CAIRO , March 7 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - One of Muammar Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said Libya would descend into civil war if his father stepped down , a move rebels who control swathes of the country have demanded , Al Arabiya television said on Monday . 
Saadi , speaking in an interview with the Arabic satellite channel , also said Libya would turn into a new Somalia and that the country 's tribes would fight against each other . 
The comments were carried in brief headlines , without giving further details .

2011-03-07,"ALGIERS | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 2:49 pm EST ALGIERS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Libyan army is attempting to drive out loose formations of rebels opposed to Muammar Gaddafi that have seized towns along the country 's Mediterranean coast . 
Though facing a vastly superior armory of tanks , artillery and aircraft , the rebels are largely standing their ground , controlling vast swathes of the east . 
Following are some scenarios for how the conflict could develop , and the clues that could indicate which one of them is most likely to become a reality : This is now looking like the most probable scenario , at least for the time being . 
Stalemate would in effect produce a divided country and raise complex questions for the outside world in its trade and political relations with the oil producer . 
`` Neither side in the Libyan conflict currently appears strong enough to defeat the other in the short term , '' said think tank IHS Global Insight . 
`` This prospect of military stalemate has raised the prospect of a protracted civil war . '' 
-- The ground-based fighting so far has been in a stretch of desert along the Mediterranean coast . 
The front line can move back and forth in this area without giving either side a significant military advantage , because there are no major population centers or bases in the area . 
The stretch is bookended by two important locations : Ajdabiyah in the east , gateway to the rebels ' eastern strongholds , and in the west Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte . 
If the fighting stays between these two locations , it amounts to stalemate . 
-- Foot-dragging among major Western powers about military intervention . 
Foreign military help could tip the balance in favor of the rebels . 
Many Libya-watchers see this as the most likely outcome in the long-term , based on the calculation that Gaddafi 's forces have spilled too much blood in the last few weeks to retain legitimacy . 
The question is , how quickly could such a victory come ? 
-- Can the rebels organize an effective military hierarchy ? 
So far , the forces have shown more zeal than military skill . 
The rebels ' National Libyan Council named Omar Hariri , one of the officers who took part in Gaddafi 's 1969 coup , as head of the military . 
But it is not clear how much authority he would have . 
Evidence on the ground that fighters are wearing standard uniforms , have received training , are operating as units , and have radios to pass orders down the chain of command , would be the clearest signs that they are getting organized . 
-- Will the rebels in Misrata hold out ? 
This city is the biggest population center still defying Gaddafi 's control outside the eastern regions . 
Troops from the 32nd Brigade , commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis and reputed to be the best forces in Libya , have so far failed to capture it . 
This is telling about the quality of Gaddafi 's forces . 
If they can not take an isolated city defended by armed civilians , they must have serious shortcomings . 
-- Outside military intervention . 
If Western powers remain wary of intervening openly , then more discreet assistance -- sending in weapons or military advisers -- could also tip the scales toward the rebels . 
-- Can the rebels take Sirte ? 
If they can , they will score the psychological victory of seizing Gaddafi 's hometown , and also control a major air base . '' 
-LRB- Sirte -RRB- controls the coast approach to Tripoli from the east and to the key nearby cities of Misrata and Zawiyah , which are the doorway to the Tripoli region , '' said Saad Djebbar , an Algerian lawyer and expert on Libya . 
This is the least likely scenario , mainly because the rebels control a huge chunk of territory and seem very well entrenched there . 
`` Gaddafi has lost the east , '' said Djebbar , who advised Tripoli when two Libyans were tried for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing . 
But Gaddafi is a proven survivor who has held on to power for more than four decades , so it is impossible to count him out . 
He has around him a coterie of political and military supporters who have much to lose if the regime collapses . 
The conflict could conceivably be decided in Tripoli , rather than the small towns on the coast , if senior military commanders or Gaddafi supporters decided the conflict could not be won . 
-- The eastern rebellion collapses under the weight of its own internal divisions and military weakness . 
This may be the only real opportunity for Gaddafi to make a comeback . 
`` In the east , the opposition are holding but they need to be careful that they do n't collapse completely , '' said David Hartwell , Middle East analyst with IHS Global Insight . 
-- Could the rebels hold together and hold the country together ? 
All opposition in Libya has been stifled over forty years of Gaddafi rule and there are no organized civic groups to provide a ready basis for government . 
One of Muammar Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said Libya would descend into civil war if his father stepped down . 
He said Libya would turn into a new Somalia and that the country 's tribes would fight against each other . 
The focus of events could switch from the smaller towns of the Mediterranean coast .

2011-03-07,"President Barack Obama is pictured at Miami Central Senior High School March 4 , 2011 . 
WASHINGTON | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 5:49 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The White House pushed back on Monday against rising pressure from some lawmakers for direct intervention in Libya , saying it first wanted to figure out what various military options could achieve . 
`` It would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya , '' said White House spokesman Jay Carney . 
`` We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we 're pursuing . '' 
Officials cautioned that a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya , an idea popular among Democratic and Republican lawmakers , would be difficult to enforce and might not stop helicopter gunships from attacking rebels fighting to end Muammar Gaddafi 's four-decade rule . 
The Obama administration has faced sharp criticism , especially from Republicans and conservative commentators , for being too cautious over the turmoil in Libya but has signaled it will not be rushed into hasty decisions that could suck the U.S. military into a new war and fuel anti-American sentiment . 
One major obstacle : U.S. officials are still trying to identify the main actors within the opposition fighting to oust Gaddafi . 
The aims of these groups are unclear and it is not even certain they view the United States favorably . 
Carney said the United States was trying to `` reach out '' to Gaddafi opponents through diplomats , business people and non-governmental groups . 
He also had a fresh warning to Gaddafi 's close associates , saying U.S. intelligence agencies were seeking to identify those involved in the violence which has forced tens of thousands of people to flee the country . 
President Barack Obama said he wanted to `` send a very clear message to the Libyan people that we will stand with them in the face of unwarranted violence and the continuing suppression of democratic ideals that we 've seen there . '' 
But Kori Schake , an associate professor at West Point military academy , was critical of Obama 's statement , saying it followed a `` pattern of broad pronouncements without practical follow-through . '' 
The White House has long said all options are on the table over Libya but , for the first time on Monday , it gave a vague priority to the possible military steps being studied . 
Bottom of the list is sending in ground troops , Carney told a briefing . 
Enforcing a no-fly zone was a `` serious '' option , he said , as was a U.N. arms embargo and humanitarian assistance . 
Arming the rebels was also a possibility , he added . 
But State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley appeared to contradict Carney when he noted that a February 26 U.N. Security Council resolution barred all weapons transfers to Libya . 
Crowley also denied a British newspaper report that Washington had asked Saudi Arabia to supply weapons to rebels . 
Military analysts say the rebels do not appear to be short of weapons and the United States would be wary of providing arms that could end up in the wrong hands and be used against U.S. forces elsewhere . 
Brian Katulis , a Middle East expert who has informally advised the White House on the turmoil sweeping the region , said the Obama administration was constrained by its reluctance to act militarily without international support . 
Defense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated on Monday that any intervention in Libya would require broad backing . 
Underscoring the lack of consensus , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow opposed military intervention . 
China , a fellow veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council , has expressed similar misgivings . 
The United States has deployed two amphibious assault ships off the Libyan coast , ostensibly to help with any humanitarian emergencies , while dispatching military transport aircraft to airlift stranded Egyptian refugees from neighboring Tunisia . 
Over the weekend , leading Republican and Democratic senators urged Obama to do more to help Libya 's rebels , who have fought Gaddafi 's security forces to a standstill in some areas but are all but powerless to stop repeated air strikes . 
Mitch McConnell , the top Republican in the Senate , said one option was `` simply aiding and arming the insurgents , '' noting that the United States often did this during the Cold War . 
John Kerry , the influential Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is close to Obama , repeated his call for a no-fly zone and floated another idea -- bombing Libyan runways to ground Gaddafi 's warplanes . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
If any money is spent , we must have current year dollar for dollar cuts in the war budgets , both overt and covert , for Iraq and Afghanistan to compensate . 
Not next year , THIS year . 
We can not afford the wars we already have . 
We can afford to pay what we have already charged for for Medicare and Social Security . 
The choice is clear . 
We can not afford both . 
We do not want these wars . 
They are not in our best interest . 
Gadaffi is likely to withstand NATO and other interventions and civil war will eventually decide the outcome ... it will take a lot of headlines before a solution unfolds . 
Principally because Libya does n't command a territorial army and tribal allegiance will ultimately decide who survives the conflict . 
Great , another possible intervention in the Middle East , just what we need . 
More American lives and funds at risk , when are we going to get out of other countries internal affairs and civil wars . 
Why do n't we leave it to the Arab League and OPEC to handle . 
What happens if Saudi Arabia starts to have internal problems , are we going to intervene against the government there with military force ?

2011-03-07,"CAIRO | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 6:43 pm EST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Two Arab newspapers and al Jazeera television said Monday Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was looking for an agreement allowing him to step down , but there was no official confirmation of the reports . 
Al Jazeera said Gaddafi had proposed to Libyan rebels to hold a meeting of parliament to pave the way for him to step down with certain guarantees . 
It said Gaddafi made the proposal to the interim council , which speaks for mostly eastern areas controlled by his opponents . 
It quoted sources in the council as saying Gaddafi wanted guarantees of personal safety for him and his family and a pledge that they not be put on trial . 
Al Jazeera said sources from the council told its correspondent in Benghazi that the offer was rejected because it would have amounted to an `` honorable '' exit for Gaddafi and would offend his victims . 
The London-based daily Asharq al-Awsat and the daily al-Bayan , based in the United Arab Emirates , also cited unnamed sources as saying Gaddafi was looking for an agreement . 
A source close to the council told Reuters he had heard that `` one formula being proposed by the other side would see Gaddafi hand power to the head of parliament and leave the country with a certain guaranteed sum of money . '' 
`` I was told that this issue of money is a serious obstacle from the national council 's point of view , '' he said , adding that his information came from a single source close to the council . 
Essam Gheriani , a media officer for the council , said : `` No such offer has been put to the council as far as I am aware . '' 
Jadallah Azous Al-Talhi , a leading member of the ruling establishment and a prime minister in the 1980s , appealed to rebel leaders for dialogue Monday , in the clearest sign yet Gaddafi may be ready to compromise with opponents challenging his four-decade rule . 
The fact that state television screened Talhi 's appeal indicated that it was officially endorsed . 
But the council said there was no room for broad dialogue with Gaddafi and any talks must be on the basis that he quits . 
Asked about Talhi 's address , rebel official Ahmed Jabreel told Reuters : `` Talhi is a close acquaintance of mine and he is widely respected in Libya as a man who stood up to Gaddafi . 
`` But we have made it clear all along that any negotiations must be on the basis that Gaddafi will step down . 
There can be no other compromise . '' 
Asharq al-Awsat , citing `` informed Libyan sources '' in Benghazi , said Gaddafi sent a negotiator to the rebel council with an offer to step down provided he had guarantees for his personal safety and that of his family as well as his money . 
Al Bayan quoted a source close to Gaddafi 's inner circle as saying the Libyan leader had begun looking for a safe haven outside Libya . 
`` He has begun making contacts with African and Arab states in search for a safe haven that will allow him to leave Libya in a way that suits his position and would not infringe on his dignity , '' it quoted the source as saying . 
The source said that `` great divisions '' within the Libyan army had caused Gaddafi to lose control of large parts of the country to rebels , according to an advance copy of the article . 
One of Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said Libya would descend into civil war if his father stepped down , Al Arabiya television reported Monday . 
`` The situation is very dangerous . 
From the perspective of a civil war , the leader must play a very , very big role in calming Libya and convincing people to sit together , '' Saadi Gaddafi said in an interview with the Arabic satellite channel . 
`` If something happened to the leader , who would be in control ? 
A civil war would start , '' he added .

Gaddafi is not as crazy as people say , he knows now that his name is associated with the Lockerbee incident that he has not protection from the international community and one way or the other he will be taken down .

2011-03-07,"TOKYO | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 8:21 pm EST TOKYO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Japan said on Tuesday it has imposed sanctions on Libya , including freezing assets of leader Muammar Gaddafi and several other Libyans , in line with a U.N. Security Council resolution . 
The United Nations and European Union have imposed sanctions on Libya and frozen government assets after forces loyal to Gaddafi fired on protesters in the oil-producing country . 
`` Based on the U.N. resolution , the cabinet agreed that Japan would carry out these measures , for the sake of unity with the international community , '' Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told a news conference after a cabinet meeting .

2011-03-07,"A million Libyans need aid as UK , France seek no-fly zone RAS LANUF , Libya | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 6:52 pm EST RAS LANUF , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain and France said they were seeking U.N. authorization for a no-fly zone over Libya , as Muammar Gaddafi 's warplanes counter-attacked against rebels and aid officials said a million people were in need . 
Al Jazeera television said rebels had rejected an offer by Gaddafi to hold a meeting of parliament to work out a deal under which he would step down . 
With civilians surrounded by forces loyal to Gaddafi in two western towns , Misrata and Zawiyah , fears grew of a rising humanitarian crisis if the fighting continued . 
U.N. aid coordinator Valerie Amos said more than a million people fleeing or inside the country needed humanitarian aid . 
`` Humanitarian organizations need urgent access now , '' she said . 
`` People are injured and dying and need help immediately . '' 
The U.N. appealed for $ 160 million to fund an operation over the next three months to get shelter , food and medicines ready . 
`` We are working closely with partners on a contingency basis on elements of a resolution on a no-fly zone , making clear the need for regional support , a clear trigger for such a resolution and an appropriate legal basis , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Monday . 
A French source said France was `` working with our partners in New York on a no-fly zone resolution . '' 
Gulf states called for a no-fly zone and an urgent Arab League meeting . 
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , in Afghanistan where foreign forces have struggled for a decade , warned action should be taken only with international backing . 
The White House said all options were on the table , including arming rebels . 
Russia , a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with veto powers , said it opposed foreign military intervention . 
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stressed the need for U.N. authorization . 
`` I ca n't imagine the international community and the United Nations would stand idly by if Gaddafi and his regime continue to attack their own people , '' he said . 
`` We have asked our military to conduct all necessary planning so that we stand ready at short notice , '' he added . 
NATO has launched 24-hour surveillance of Libya with AWACS reconnaissance aircraft , the U.S. ambassador to NATO said . 
Ivo Daalder added NATO representatives were discussing other possible moves ahead of a meeting of NATO ministers on Thursday . 
Western leaders , however , are anxious to avoid another drawn-out military commitment after the Iraq and Afghan wars . 
President Barack Obama said he wanted to `` send a very clear message to the Libyan people that we will stand with them in the face of unwarranted violence and the continuing suppression of democratic ideals . '' 
In the rebel-held city of Misrata , the wounded were being treated on hospital floors because of a catastrophic shortage of medical facilities in the besieged city , a resident said . 
Misrata is the biggest city in the west not under the control of Gaddafi , and its stand against a militia commanded by his own son has turned it into a symbol of defiance . 
Zawiyah , just 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli , remained in rebel hands despite a push by government forces into the town , according to a Sky television report . 
It showed wounded fighters and civilians in Zawiya 's hospital , including a 10-year-old boy reportedly shot on his doorstep by government troops . 
In the east , warplanes launched air strikes on the rebel-held oil terminal town of Ras Lanuf 600 km -LRB- 400 miles -RRB- east of the capital Tripoli , witnesses said . 
One ripped through a car carrying a family . 
Shipping sources said the fighting had closed the oil ports of Ras Lanuf and Brega . 
Brent crude prices rose above $ 118 a barrel on Monday before falling back to $ 115 and U.S. prices pushed to their highest level since September 2008 . 
The fighting has been erratic , with small groups engaging each other , guerrilla-style , in hit and run raids . 
Air attacks have been fitful and bombing often inaccurate . 
The resilience of Gaddafi 's troops and their ability to counter-attack has raised the prospect of prolonged bloodshed . 
The United Nations and the European Union are dispatching fact-finding missions to the north African nation , where reports by residents of attacks on civilians by security forces have triggered a war crimes probe and provoked global outrage . 
The rebels have called for U.N.-backed air strikes against what they say are African soldiers-for-hire used by Gaddafi to crush the uprising against his four-decade rule . 
The Libyan government says it is fighting against al Qaeda terrorists and maintains its security forces have targeted only armed individuals attacking state institutions and depots . 
Government forces ' advance on Ras Lanuf forced residents to flee and rebels to hide weapons in the desert . 
One man complained of the rebels ' inexperience , as a fighter fired an automatic weapon ineffectually at a warplane . 
`` Look at the way they 're firing at the plane , '' he said . 
`` They have no experience , no leadership and no strategy . '' 
Al Jazeera quoted sources from the rebel interim council as saying it rejected Gaddafi 's proposal to quit because it would have been an `` honorable '' exit for him . 
The channel said Gaddafi had wanted guarantees of safety for him and his family and a pledge they not be put on trial . 
Jadallah Azous Al-Talhi , a former prime minister , earlier appeared on state television to urge rebels to `` give a chance to national dialogue to resolve this crisis . '' 
Ahmed Jabreel , an aide to rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil , said : `` Any negotiations must be on the basis that Gaddafi will step down . 
There can be no other compromise . '' 
Two Arabic newspapers said the Libyan leader had begun looking for a safe haven outside Libya . 
One of Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said Libya would descend into civil war if his father stepped down , Al Arabiya television reported , adding that Libya would turn into a new Somalia and that the country 's tribes would fight each other . 
In an interview with France 24 television , Gaddafi said Libya was an important partner for the West in containing al Qaeda and illegal migrants trying to reach Europe . 
`` There are millions of blacks who could come to the Mediterranean to cross to France and Italy , and Libya plays a role in security in the Mediterranean , '' he said . 
So far tens of thousands of migrant workers have fled but few Libyans . 
`` If we get a massive outflow of Libyans , this would create a refugee situation , so we appeal to all countries to keep their doors open and be ready to provide assistance as humanitarian law requires , '' United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said . 
A British team reported to include special forces left Benghazi on Sunday after rebels captured and then released them . 
Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa said 300 al Qaeda fighters formerly held in Guantanamo Bay were supporting rebel forces . 
`` It 's clear there is a conspiracy to divide Libya , '' he said . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Rebels do n't have any chance to wage war against army forces in desert . 
Those offensives-f from Misrata on Tripoli or Sirte are daydreaming Fear of civil war ? 
Im pretty sure this is what 's occurring already NOW is the time to take out those runways -- B-2 's can do it with Zero loss of life on either side -- It will get this mess over MUCH sooner -- with significant lives saved on BOTH sides -- it is a no brainer .

2011-03-08,"By the CNN Wire Staff Rebel fighters take cover as a bomb dropped by a fighter jet explodes on the outskirts of Ras Lanuf on March 7 . 
NEW : President Obama pledges $ 15 million in humanitarian aid NEW : Libya 's foreign minister accuses some Western nations of helping divide the country NATO begins around-the-clock surveillance flights 3 members of the U.N. Security Council discuss a possible no-fly zone Tune in to `` AC360 '' for the latest on what 's next for Libya , the opposition and Moammar Gadhafi . 
Watch `` AC360 '' at 10 p.m. ET Monday on CNN . 
Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf Monday , launching aerial strikes as part of an assault aimed at crushing the uprising against him . 
At the end of the third week of unrest -- protests began February 15 -- Gadhafi 's aerial forces targeted the main road heading into the oil town after launching another air strike earlier , five kilometers southeast of the city . 
In what has turned into a civil war , members of the opposition fired anti-aircraft guns toward Gadhafi 's planes . 
Some families fled Ras Lanuf , hoping to escape the violence that has engulfed some of the country 's most populous areas . 
Inside the mind of Saif Gadhafi British diplomatic team taken in Libya Libya conflict moves closer to capital Meanwhile , U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said `` there are credible reports of the use of helicopter gunships against civilians by government forces . '' 
Three members of the U.N. Security Council -- France , Britain , and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya , diplomatic sources at the United Nations said . 
But any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China , two permanent members of the council that wield veto power . 
U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he had a `` very clear message to those who are around Col. Gadhafi : It is their choice to make how they operate moving forward and they will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there . '' 
`` We 've got NATO as we speak consulting in Brussels around a wide range of potential options , including potential military options , in response to the violence that continues to take place inside Libya , '' he said . 
In a statement , NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said NATO did not intend to intervene in Libya , but `` as a defense Alliance and a security organization , it is our job to conduct prudent planning for any eventuality . '' 
NATO has begun around-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya , as it considers options for dealing with the Libyan violence , U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told reporters Monday . 
While the opposition has managed to fight off onslaughts by Gadhafi 's forces in some places -- including what a witness described as an `` amazing '' victory against Gadhafi 's heavy artillery Sunday in the town of Misrata -- the regime has advanced as well . 
Gadhafi 's forces seemed to make headway in the city of Bin Jawad , where the Libyan army appeared to have control Monday after fighting over the weekend . 
But in Zawiya -- a city that the government insisted it had retaken -- the opposition still appeared to control the city center , and fighting was under way Monday . 
CNN saw pro-Gadhafi forces moving through the city , small arms fire , anti-aircraft gunfire and artillery . 
As the Libyan military brought in reinforcements , CNN could see about 150 troops moving into the city . 
Libya witness : Rockets on the ground Searching the Gadhafi family tree Anti-government protesters are seeking the ouster of the 68-year-old Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of ruling the country -- the kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . 
But unlike in those countries , the Libyan uprising has turned into warfare . 
Libya 's foreign minister dug in Monday , saying the international community does not understand what is happening in Libya and accusing certain Western countries of helping divide the African nation . 
`` It is clear now the U.K. and the U.S. are getting in touch with the defected -LRB- people -RRB- in the East , '' Foreign Minister Musa Kasa told reporters . 
`` This means a conspiracy to divide , partition the country . '' 
`` It is clear these super powers are undertaking a plot against Libya , '' he added . 
Though rebel groups are long on passion , many are short on military training . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman , just outside Ras Lanouf , heard someone say , `` We 'll capture -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , put him on top of this car and drive all around Libya . 
Every Libyan will get one shot . '' 
A special forces captain told Wedeman he is trying to teach volunteers `` it 's impossible to attack artillery with a Kalishnikov '' rifle . 
Foreign Secretary Hague , speaking to Britain 's Parliament , said that in the Libyan capital , Tripoli , `` there have been disturbing reports of hostage taking and large military deployments around the city designed to consolidate Gadhafi 's position and intimidate his opponents . 
His forces remain in control of Tripoli , Sebha and Sirte ; but his authority is contested in large swathes of the country where local tribes have withdrawn their support . 
There is a clear risk of protracted conflict and an extremely dangerous and volatile situation in large parts of the country . '' 
With no clear end to the deadly clashes in sight , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli , the United Nations said in a statement Monday . 
`` The secretary-general is deeply concerned about the fighting in western Libya , which is claiming large numbers of lives and threatens even more carnage in the days ahead , '' read the U.N. statement . 
`` He notes that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence , and calls for an immediate halt to the government 's disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets . '' 
Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . 
The fierce fighting has also sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . 
About 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the U.N. refugee agency has said . 
But not everyone has been able to get out . 
Between 15,000 and 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border . 
Of those left , the majority are from Bangladesh , the U.N. refugee agency said . 
The group plans to start running chartered flights to there Tuesday . 
President Obama authorized Monday sending up to $ 15 million in humanitarian aid to Libya out of the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund . 
Humanitarian and medical aid to Misrata , in central Libya , has been blocked , U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in a statement Sunday . 
She urged authorities `` to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives . '' 
After reports of the opposition successfully fighting off pro-Gadhafi forces in Misrata on Sunday , Libyan state TV showed a graphic -- in both Arabic and English -- saying that `` strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs , who took civilians as human shields and threatened to slaughter the inhabitants of those cities . '' 
The report cited `` military sources . '' 
There have been numerous conflicting reports over who controlled what cities , with the government declaring victory in some cities while witnesses in those cities told CNN the opposition was still in control . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman , Nic Robertson , Arwa Damon , Salma Abdelaziz , Jomana Karadsheh and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .

2011-03-08,"By the CNN Wire Staff Migrants at a camp in Tunisia having crossed from Libya -- there are reports of violence against sub-Saharan Africans in Libya . 
Sudanese tell U.N. refugee agency of rape and forced removals The agency is `` alarmed '' by the accounts Thousands of migrants remain at Tunisian and Egyptian borders The U.N. is able to truck emergency food into eastern Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Nations refugee agency reported disturbing accounts of violence and persecution of sub-Saharan Africans within Libya Tuesday , urging a recognition of their particular vulnerability in the midst of civil war . 
A group of Sudanese who arrived in Egypt from eastern Libya told representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- that armed Libyans were going to door to door , forcing people from sub-Saharan countries to leave . 
They also reported the rape of a 12-year-old Sudanese girl and said many of their documents had been confiscated or destroyed . 
Spokesman Adrian Edwards said the agency was alarmed by such accounts , increasing in number as the situation in Libya intensifies . 
Sub-Saharan Africans came under attack after reports that strongman Moammar Gadhafi had recruited them to serve as mercenaries . 
Libya 's war has forced out 215,000 people , many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders . 
The refugee agency has been working with the International Organization of Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- to evacuate people , many of whom have been spending cold nights under the stars and with very little to eat . 
Others have been sheltered in cramped , unsanitary conditions . 
The IOM said it was accelerating repatriation of Bangladeshis , who remain stranded by the thousands on both borders with Libya . 
The agency said it will need at least 20 more chartered flights to evacuate Bangladeshis remaining on the Egyptian border alone . 
A Bangladeshi man died over the weekend after a fight over food distribution at the Egyptian border , the UNHCR staff reported . 
They said many of the 3,500 Bangladeshis at that border have been waiting for up to 10 days for transportation and are becoming increasingly agitated . 
Fewer people are crossing over from Libya into Tunisia , a drop the UNHCR said coincided with intensified fighting in western Libya . 
Those fleeing have described risky travel conditions and numerous roadblocks . 
As the fighting escalates in Libya , many are in dire need of help just to survive , U.N. agencies said . 
The U.N. World Food Programme said a convoy of its trucks was able to enter eastern Libya and was due to arrive in Benghazi some time Tuesday . 
The convoy , carrying high-energy date bars , was part of a $ 39.2 million emergency operation intended to provide food to more than one million people in Libya , Egypt and Tunisia over a three-month period .

2011-03-08,"Fierce battles raged Tuesday for control of key Libyan cities in the east and west as Libya entered its fourth week of fighting and continued its descent into civil war . 
In the eastern oil city of Ras Lanuf , rebels fired antiaircraft guns after Libya 's air force carried out fresh raids . 
Video shot by Sky News showed that fighting was continuing in Zawiya , despite government assertions that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi controlled the oil-refining city . 
Hundreds of anti-government demonstrators could be seen marching in the street , many of them pumping their fists in the air . 
As the crackle of gunfire could be heard , the demonstrators ran toward the camera . 
Four men could be seen carrying a fifth , then putting him into an ambulance . 
A doctor who left the city in the morning told CNN that Gadhafi forces had fatally shot two fellow doctors in the main square and were shooting wounded civilians rather than allowing them to be treated . 
The city 's two medical clinics were closed , he said . 
Military casualties were being taken from the city by ambulance , he said . 
CNN was not able to witness the fighting and could not independently confirm reports of what was happening there on Tuesday . 
Opposition officials accused Gadhafi of bombing water reserves in Ras Lanuf , the site of intense fighting in recent days . 
Rebels have seized several cities and the army has fought fiercely to reclaim some of them . 
On Tuesday , Gadhafi addressed a tribal group of youthful supporters in a talk broadcast on television and repeated his assertions that the nation 's youths have been misled and drugged by al Qaeda . 
`` For them , everybody 's their enemy , '' he said . 
`` They know nothing other than killing . '' 
He praised the Libyan standard of living as one that others in the world envy and called on his countrymen to defend it . 
`` They want to take your petrol , '' he said . 
`` This is what America , this is what the French , those colonialists , want . '' 
He cited people from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Algeria as among those who have joined the rebel forces -- `` hunting children who are not mature , who have certain deficiencies ; they offer them pills . 
This is what we understood so far . '' 
He called anti-government forces in Benghazi , a rebel-held town in the east , `` traitors '' and predicted that the pro-Gadhafi residents `` are going to throw them out . ''

2011-03-08,"By the CNN Wire Staff NATO , U.N. ponder Libya solution NATO has launched constant surveillance flights over Libya A senior U.S. official denies speculation about the possibility of arming rebels British , French , and American officials are working on a draft U.N. text regarding a no-fly zone `` It is our job to conduct prudent planning , '' a NATO official says -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO has launched around-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya as it considers various options for dealing with escalating violence in the war-torn country , America 's ambassador to the organization told reporters Monday . 
Representatives of key Western powers also highlighted the possibility of establishing a no-fly zone in Libya -- part of growing campaign to break strongman Moammar Gadhafi 's grip on power . 
British , French and U.S. officials were working on a draft text that includes language on a no-fly zone , diplomatic sources at the United Nations told CNN . 
The language in the text will deal with triggers rather than timelines for taking such a step , one diplomat noted . 
If gross violations of human rights are committed , the diplomat added , the elements of the text could be quickly turned into a resolution . 
Any resolution on military intervention in Libya , however , would be subject to a vote by the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council . 
Such intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China , who rarely approve of such measures . 
U.N. Western powers mull no-fly zone Inside the mind of Saif Gadhafi British diplomatic team taken in Libya Libya conflict moves closer to capital `` The violence that 's been taking place and perpetrated by the government in Libya is unacceptable , '' U.S. President Barack Obama said at the White House . 
Moammar Gadhafi 's government `` will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there . '' 
Obama stressed that NATO is considering a wide range of responses -- including military options -- for dealing with the crisis . 
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later cited three potential responses under active consideration : establishing the no-fly zone , military-backed humanitarian aid , and stronger enforcement of the U.N. arms embargo . 
Carney downplayed speculation about the possibility of providing arms to the Libyan rebels , telling reporters that `` it would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya . '' 
`` We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we 're pursuing , '' he warned . 
A senior U.S. official familiar with the administration 's deliberations on Libya denied a report in the British press that the administration had asked Saudi Arabia to arm the rebels . 
U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague told members of the British parliament , however , that `` we are making contingency plans for all eventualities in Libya . '' 
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in Belgium that the organization has no immediate intention to intervene in the Libyan civil war . 
But `` as a defense alliance and a security organization , it is our job to conduct prudent planning for any eventuality , '' he said . 
Rasmussen stressed that it is important to `` remain vigilant '' in light of `` systemic attacks '' by Gadhafi 's regime against the Libyan population . 
`` The violation of human rights and international humanitarian law is outrageous , '' he said . 
Rasmussen also noted that the defense ministers from member states will meet Friday and Saturday to discuss how the organization can help partner countries in North Africa and the broader Middle East . 
`` We can see a strong wind of change blowing across the region -- and it is blowing in the direction of freedom and democracy , '' he asserted . 
Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kasa lashed out the Western leaders , calling their response part of `` a conspiracy to divide -LRB- and -RRB- partition the country . '' 
`` The English are yearning for the colonial era '' while Obama is acting `` like a child , '' he said . 
`` Territorial integrity is sacrosanct and we will die for it . '' 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , meanwhile , appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli , the United Nations said in a statement Monday . 
Abdelilah Al-Khatib , a former foreign minister of Jordan , will `` undertake urgent consultations with the authorities in Tripoli and in the region on the immediate humanitarian situation as well as the wider dimensions of the crisis , '' according to the statement . 
As diplomats debated various options , the violence in Libya continued to intensify . 
Forces loyal to Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf , launching aerial strikes meant to help crush the uprising against him . 
Death toll estimates from the conflict have reached as high as 2,000 people . 
Roughly 200,000 people have fled Libya , with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , according to the United Nations .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : CNN is one example . 
So is CNN Student News . 
In fact , you could be an example , and you 're going to see how and what we 're talking about in the next few minutes . 
I 'm Carl Azuz . 
CNN Student News takes off right now . 
AZUZ : After three weeks of fighting between people who support and oppose Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , other world leaders are calling the situation in Libya a civil war . 
Rebels have taken control of several cities . 
The Libyan army has fought to regain some of those cities . 
Officials estimate more than a thousand people have died in the violence . 
There were reports yesterday that Colonel Gadhafi was negotiating with rebel leaders , saying he would step down if they could promise that he 'd be able to leave the country safely and that he and his family would not be put on trial . 
But later on both sides denied these reports . 
Some rebel leaders said the negotiations never happened , and a government spokesman called the reports lies . 
The international community is trying to find ways to end the violence in Libya . 
And one suggestion is a no-fly zone over the country . 
What that would mean is that no military planes could fly over Libya without permission . 
The United Nations Security Council is talking about it , and the idea has a lot of support from countries in the Middle East . 
NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , is already running ` round-the-clock surveillance flights over Libya . 
AZUZ : In neighboring Egypt , about a thousand people showed up for a pro-women demonstration yesterday . 
Women were a major part of the protests that forced former President Hosni Mubarak out of power from Egypt last month . 
But this protest turned into a shouting match when groups of men started yelling anti-feminist chants , like `` go home , that 's where you belong . '' 
There were men on both sides of these protests . 
The people who organized the women 's march said they 're demanding `` fair and equal opportunity for all Egyptian citizens -- beyond gender , religion or class . '' 
AZUZ : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a similar point at an event that commemorated the 100th anniversary of International Women 's Day . 
When referring to the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa we 've seen lately , Secretary Clinton said women `` have just as much right as the men to remake their governments . '' 
She and first lady Michelle Obama honored 10 women with the International Women of Courage Award . 
Secretary Clinton said the women 's courage comes from putting others ' well-being before their own . 
And Mrs. Obama said the awards send a message to women that `` you are never alone in your struggle . '' 
TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : See if you can I.D. Me ! 
In the U.S. , I was first celebrated in Mobile , Alabama . 
I 'm an annual event whose colors are purple , gold and green . 
In French , my name translates to `` Fat Tuesday . '' 
I 'm Mardi Gras , known as Carnival in other parts of the world . 
AZUZ : Mardi Gras is the last day of the Carnival season . 
This whole celebration lasts for several days , but it always ends on Fat Tuesday , also called Shrove Tuesday , and that was yesterday . 
A lot of cities host Mardi Gras celebrations , and it might have started in Mobile . 
But most people associate the annual event -- in the U.S. anyway -- with New Orleans . 
The typical attendance for Mardi Gras : more than a million people . 
They show up for the parties and for the parades , and those are organized by social clubs called `` krewes ; '' `` krewe '' with a `` k '' . 
Traditionally , when the clock strikes midnight at the end of Fat Tuesday , a group of New Orleans police march down the city 's famous Bourbon Street , announcing the end of Carnival . 
CHRISTINE ROMANS , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : It 's not only the uber famous who can brand themselves . 
Digital media , Twitter and Facebook make it easy for almost anyone to create a brand .

TONY HAWK , PROFESSIONAL SKATEBOARDER : The first thing , you have to have something to offer , you know what I mean ? 
I do n't really believe in being famous just because you 're famous . 
ROMANS : ... To chef Paula Deen . 
PAULA DEEN , CHEF : You know , you kind of have to reinvent yourself . 
You know , you have to keep things fresh . 
I did start this little lunch business called The Bag Lady , y ' all . 
ROMANS : What about the average person ? 
Could creating your own brand give you an edge ? 
SAM CHAKO , JOB SEEKER : I do n't know how to market myself to get employers to notice me . 
FORD R. MYERS , CAREER COACH : The market is too tough . 
Unemployment numbers are still high . 
Every candidate needs to find a way to stand out . 
ROMANS : So , how do you create your own brand ? 
Career counselor Ford Myers has some tips . 
MYERS : Every candidate can identify what is their unique selling proposition or what is their special brand . 
Look through their own background , their own resumes , their letters of recommendation , their performance reviews and find what stands out . 
ROMANS : Leadership and management author Bill Taylor has a cult following . 
ROMANS : You walk into the boardroom ... BILL TAYLOR , AUTHOR , `` PRACTICALLY RADICAL '' : Right . 
ROMANS : When you walk into the job interview , when you walk into your dining room ... ROMANS : Are we all becoming brands ? 
TAYLOR : I think , you know , being a brand is not being flamboyant . 
It works for Lady Gaga . 
It would n't work for you in your organization . 
Being a brand , as everybody knows , when I meet Christine Romans , this is what she stands for , this is the impact she was trying to have . 
AZUZ : All right , last week , we told you the story about how the people of Christchurch , New Zealand found a time capsule after an earthquake leveled parts of their city . 
We tried to get you thinking about what you would leave for the next generation to discover . 
What would you put in your own time capsule ? 
Here 's what some of you had to say about it . 
iPod : very popular choice for many of you . 
Cassidy says `` songs contain everything about a generation : the moods , language and technological advances of our time . '' 
Leah would also leave an iPod , but added that she 'd leave `` 20 bucks , because so many people have been tight on money due to the economic status '' of the country . 
She said she 'd also include a note saying why she left each thing in order to tell people about the world 's turmoil . 
But , if she could leave something out , it would be the note because history , she says , should n't repeat itself . 
Lucus wants to include fast food wrappers in the time capsule . 
He feels the world is slowly becoming obese from the fast food people eat . 
Sierra wants to include a book . 
I thought this was interesting . 
Sierra thinks that books are the highs and lows of humanity on pieces of paper . 
And finally , Ben says he would n't leave a thing because , according to him , the economy , the violence : it 's just not worth preserving for future generations . 
AZUZ : Really interesting insight , if a little cynical there . 
All right , our next story is one we think will get a lot of you talking on our blog . 
St. Augustine High School in New Orleans uses corporal punishment -- paddling -- to discipline students . 
This past Friday , students at the school held a rally in support of the policy . 
The students actually want to keep paddling . 
It 's been part of St. Augustine for its entire 60 year history . 
But the school stopped corporal punishment this year after the local Archbishop said paddling does n't belong in a Catholic school . 
He said , `` I believe hitting a child , or a young man , does not build character . '' 
And the Archbishop said a study showed that St. Augustine does n't have any safeguards in place to prevent the paddling from turning into abuse . 
Listen to this , though . 
They say corporal punishment is part of the tradition that makes St. Augustine work . 
This can not be argued . 
This can not be changed . 
JACOB WASHINGTON , ST. AUGUSTINE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT : You 're not just taking away a form of discipline . 
You 're taking away a form of life at St. Augustine . 
AZUZ : You 've heard what the Archbishop had to say . 
You 've heard some of the students ' opinions . 
Now , we want to hear yours ! 
Head to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com . 
Tell us your reaction to what 's going on at St. Augustine . 
We 're looking forward to reading what you have to say . 
But one thing we want you to remember , on our blog , it is first names only . 
Please do n't give us any more info than that . 
AZUZ : Finally today , many of you saw it , that PIXAR movie `` Up '' ? 
This is the real-life version ! 
A team of scientists and engineers wanted to see if they could pull off the movie 's stunt of lifting a house with a bunch of balloons . 
Took them two weeks ; all they needed were 300 massive balloons ! 
The house made it all the way up to 10,000 feet , flew around for about an hour . 
We wonder if they were careful of insects that high up though . 
AZUZ : I mean , after all , you could run into some huge houseflies . 
And after two weeks of hard work , it 's nice to see the project get off the ground . 
But imagine if it had n't worked . 
That would really burst their bubble . 
All right , we 're gonna take off before these puns balloon out of control . 
But we are gonna be back tomorrow to float some more headlines by you .

2011-03-08,"LONDON | Tue Mar 8 , 2011 10:32 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A frontline in Libya 's civil war looked to be consolidating on Tuesday , dividing the country in two along historic a provincial boundary , leaving key oil facilities stuck in the middle of the emerging conflict . 
The eastern city of Benghazi looks to have firmly thrown off control by Muammar Gaddafi , but the veteran leader looks to have managed to clamp down on unrest in the capital Tripoli and is besieging and battling to cement his control in nearby towns . 
Experts say the western conflict -- particularly the outcome of any uprising in Tripoli itself -- could decide Gaddafi 's fate . 
So could bargaining with the leaderships of major tribes . 
In the meantime , fighting seemed on Tuesday to be stalling along the coastal front between Benghazi and Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte -- an area that includes oil ports and refineries . 
`` In the short term , we 're looking at the de facto division of the country , '' said Control Risks analyst Henry Smith . 
The dividing point on the coastal strip looks to be around the oil refining and export towns of Brega and Ras Lanuf -- scene of recent fighting and air strikes . 
If confrontation along that front remains violent , it may further jeopardize oil sales . 
Oil sources told Reuters that both ports were now closed to traffic , although the eastern port of Tobruk -- now under control of the Benghazi-based opposition -- remained open . 
Businesses and diplomats face an awkward prospect of having to deal with a divided country , where payment to authorities in Tripoli may no longer ensure oil shipments from the east , and where relations may need restoring with a leader in the capital who Western powers said they wanted overthrown without delay . 
The example of Ivory Coast , divided since 2002 , is a reminder of how such civil conflicts can become entrenched . 
Both sides insist they will shortly triumph and reunite Libya . 
The rebels say Gaddafi is only just hanging on , playing down suggestions of looming de facto partition of the country . 
`` Gaddafi only has small pockets in Tripoli and other towns , '' said Ashour Shamis , a Libyan writer and editor of a pro-opposition online newspaper . 
`` All he has is his family . 
Libya is not divided . 
It has never been divided . '' 
But while many analysts believe there is widespread discontent with Gaddafi in western Libya , he may have enough troops and equipment to crush urban pockets of resistance and deter protesters from taking to the streets in the capital . 
His chances of demolishing the eastern opposition may be tougher , however , reflecting partly distance from the capital , but also deep-rooted differences between the historic provinces of Cyrenaica , around Benghazi , and Tripolitania , which Italian colonial rulers united to create modern Libya 80 years ago . 
`` The area around Benghazi has always been the center of resistance against both the Gaddafi regime and before it the Italian occupation , '' said Smith at Control Risks . 
The eastern rebels have taken the flag of the old monarchy from Cyrenaica , ousted by Gaddafi in a military coup in 1969 . 
Gaddafi has long relied heavily on members of his own Gaddadfa tribe from around Sirte , using them in key positions particularly in core `` regime protection '' units . 
But he has also built alliances with other groups through marriage and important government appointments . 
That has allowed him to weather previous tribal uprisings by groups such as the eastern-based Warfalla , widely seen as Libya 's largest tribe . 
Together with the second largest tribal group , the Margarha , they rebelled in 1993 against Gaddafi demanding greater representation in government . 
The revolt failed and a number of Warfalla leaders were killed , imprisoned or driven into exile -- although experts say they still retain a considerable presence within the military . 
After negotiations behind closed doors , the Margarha were able to maintain better ties with Gaddafi . 
However , many believe loyalties in the final analysis will also come down to more immediate personal decisions and relationships as commanders and leaders wait to back the winning side . 
Many tribes themselves break down into multiple subgroups . '' 
`` We 've seen various statements from various figures about the loyalty of their tribes , but it 's far from clear that structures are that simple , '' said Control Risks ' Smith . 
`` There will be a lot of people aiming to sit on the sidelines to see which way things go . ''

Full Article Libya no-fly zone talks , protracted conflict looms RAS LANUF , Libya | Tue Mar 8 , 2011 2:16 pm IST RAS LANUF , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain and France spearheaded a drive at the United Nations for a no-fly zone over Libya as battles raged across the country and Muammar Gaddafi 's son said a civil war would erupt if his father stepped down . 
The White House pushed back against rising pressure from some U.S. lawmakers for direct intervention in Libya , saying it first wanted to figure out what military options could achieve in this oil-producing desert state which is wracked by conflict . 
Civilians were surrounded by Gaddafi forces in two western towns , Misrata and Zawiyah , and in the east warplanes hit the rebel-held oil terminal town of Ras Lanuf as strikes and counter-attacks pointed to an increasingly protracted conflict . 
Two Arab papers and al Jazeera television said Gaddafi was looking for a pact allowing him to step down , but there was no official confirmation of the reports . 
Gaddafi in public has vowed to fight on and never leave Libya . 
One of Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said in an interview with Al Arabiya television his father had not yet thrown his army into full battle against the rebels , saving it to shield Libya against foreign attack and to protect `` sensitive sites '' . 
`` The tribes are all armed , there are forces from the Libyan army and the eastern region is armed . 
The situation is not like Tunisia or Egypt , '' said Saadi . 
`` If something happened to the leader , who would be in control ? 
A civil war would start . '' 
The battlefield in eastern Libya around important oil terminals has become mired in attack and counter-attack between the loose-knit rebel army of young volunteers and defectors and the Libyan armed forces in a buffer zone of barren landscape between the east and the west of Libya . 
The largely inexperienced rebels lack the firepower of their rivals . 
They have no warplanes to back them up and rely mostly on heavy machineguns , anti-aircraft weapons and rocket propelled grenades . 
They travel by 4x4 pick-up trucks . 
But their agility , often fairly chaotic at the front , has given them a degree of protection from Gaddafi 's forces , who have proved more effective at quashing the rebellion in the west around the Libyan leader 's Tripoli powerbase . 
U.N. aid coordinator Valerie Amos said the fighting across Libya meant that more than a million people fleeing or inside the country needed humanitarian aid . 
`` Humanitarian organizations need urgent access now , '' she said . 
`` People are injured and dying and need help immediately . '' 
The United Nations appealed for $ 160 million for an operation over the next months to prepare shelter , food and medicine . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said London was working with its partners `` on elements of a resolution on a no-fly zone , making clear the need for regional support , a clear trigger for such a resolution and an appropriate legal basis '' . 
A French source said France also was working with its U.N. partners on a no-fly zone resolution . 
Gulf states called for a no-fly zone and an urgent Arab League meeting . 
Western allies differ over how a no-fly zone might be implemented . 
The United States has said it would involve a large-scale military operation , including strikes on Libyan air defences , but some military analysts have said it could be limited to preventing flights in Libyan airspace , without a big preliminary campaign . 
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , in Afghanistan where foreign forces have struggled for a decade , said action should be taken only with international backing . 
The White House said all options were on the table , including arming rebels . 
Russia , a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with veto powers , said it opposed foreign military intervention . 
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stressed the need for U.N. authorisation . 
`` I ca n't imagine the international community and the United Nations would stand idly by if Gaddafi and his regime continue to attack their own people , '' he said . 
NATO has launched 24-hour surveillance of Libya with AWACS reconnaissance aircraft , the U.S. ambassador to NATO said . 
U.S. President Barack Obama said he wanted to `` send a very clear message to the Libyan people that we will stand with them in the face of unwarranted violence and the continuing suppression of democratic ideals '' . 
As the international community sought to isolate Gaddafi 's government , Japan said on Tuesday it had imposed sanctions on Libya , including freezing assets of Gaddafi and several other Libyans , in line with a U.N. Security Council resolution . 
`` Based on the U.N. resolution , the cabinet agreed that Japan would carry out these measures , for the sake of unity with the international community , '' Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told a news conference after a cabinet meeting . 
In the rebel-held city of Misrata , the wounded were being treated on hospital floors because of a catastrophic shortage of medical facilities in the besieged city , a resident said . 
Misrata is the biggest city in the west not under the control of Gaddafi , and its stand against a militia commanded by his own son has turned it into a symbol of defiance . 
Zawiyah , just 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli , was in rebel hands despite a government forces ' push , Sky television said . 
In the east , warplanes launched strikes on the rebel-held oil town of Ras Lanuf 600 km -LRB- 400 miles -RRB- east of the capital Tripoli . 
One ripped through a car carrying a family . 
Shipping sources said the fighting had closed the Ras Lanuf terminal and the oil port of Brega . 
Brent crude prices rose above $ 118 a barrel on Monday before falling back to $ 115 and U.S. prices pushed to their highest level since September 2008 . 
Youcef Yousfi , president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries , said there were no plans for a crisis meeting of the group and high prices were short term . 
The Libyan government says it is fighting against al Qaeda terrorists and maintains its security forces have targeted only armed individuals attacking state institutions and depots . 
Al Jazeera quoted sources from the rebel interim council as saying it rejected Gaddafi 's proposal to quit because it would have been an `` honorable '' exit for him . 
The channel said Gaddafi had wanted guarantees of safety for him and his family and a pledge they not be put on trial . 
Jadallah Azous Al-Talhi , a former prime minister , earlier appeared on state television to urge rebels to `` give a chance to national dialogue to resolve this crisis '' . 
Ahmed Jabreel , an aide to rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil , said : `` Any negotiations must be on the basis that Gaddafi will step down . 
There can be no other compromise . '' 
So far tens of thousands of migrant workers have fled but few Libyans . 
`` If we get a massive outflow of Libyans , this would create a refugee situation , so we appeal to all countries to keep their doors open and be ready to provide assistance as humanitarian law requires , '' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said .

2011-03-08,"LONDON | Tue Mar 8 , 2011 12:52 pm EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan oil trade has virtually been paralyzed as banks decline to clear payments in dollars due to U.S. sanctions , trading sources told Reuters on Tuesday . 
The move follows a decision by major U.S. oil firms to halt trade with Libya and makes it almost impossible for European firms to buy Libyan oil and supply refineries in countries such as France and Italy . 
Around half of Libya 's oil output , or more than 1 percent of global supply , has already been choked off by lethal clashes between rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
`` Banks do n't want to finance the system in Libya , so for the moment no one is getting money for oil . 
There are big problems for payments , '' said a senior trader with a European oil company . 
Oil prices hit their highest since September 2008 on Monday as cuts in Libyan exports piled pressure on OPEC to boost output . 
Goldman Sachs bank said OPEC 's spare capacity to cushion lost output was much smaller than thought . 
Sources at or close to major European buyers of Libyan crude , including Italy 's Eni , ERG , Total and Saras , said the decision by banks to stop export financing of Libyan crude had virtually brought all transactions to a halt . 
`` It 's not a matter of choice , there is an embargo on U.S. dollars coming in and out of Libya , '' said a trader with one of the firms , referring to banks ' resistance to clear payments in the U.S. currency . 
`` All U.S. dollar transactions are being blocked , '' the trader said , adding it was not clear at this stage if payments were possible in other currencies and whether any Swiss or European banks were willing to conclude transactions . 
Western countries , the European Union and United Nations have imposed sanctions on Libya and frozen government assets in response to forces loyal to Gaddafi firing on protesters . 
`` Sometimes it is easier not to trade at all than to trade with many caveats , '' said an oil trader working for a major international bank , adding EU 's law interpretations could reopen some paths for trade in the long-term . 
`` If you can prove that money from oil purchased goes back to accounts not controlled by Gadaffi and family , perhaps you could argue that you are buying oil for humanitarian purposes and that the money would flow back into the country , '' he said . 
Most estimates suggest around half of Libya 's 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of oil production capacity has been suspended due to clashes between government forces and rebels . 
`` A virtually complete shut-in of Libyan crude production until the civil-war situation clarifies , or until peace is restored , is therefore now under way , '' said Samuel Ciszuk from IHS consultancy . 
`` Fears over sanctions are doing their part to isolate the Libyan regime . '' 
Some European countries such as France and Italy heavily rely on Libyan crude imports and will be looking for ways to restore supplies as quickly as possible . 
`` The loss of Libyan light-sweet crude poses a threat to the profitability of Europe 's already troubled refining industry , '' JBC consultancy said in a note . 
`` This is due to the fact that refineries rely heavily on high quality crudes to produce value-added products and minimize expensive processing , '' it added . 
However , Ciszuk said shippers may refrain from approaching Libyan oil ports because of fighting and will be in no hurry to return as long as insurers at the Lloyd 's of London insurance market classify Libya as a high risk , or a war-zone destination . 
`` Insurance premiums play a significant role in the cost of crude shipping and escalated premiums for Libya mean that crude from other parts of the Middle East and North Africa , where sufficient capacity exists to replace Libyan output , instantly become more attractive , '' he said .

2011-03-08,"\* Source says Gaddafi may want financial guarantees \* Libyan leader has vowed to fight on , not to leave Libya BENGHAZI , Libya , March 8 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Muammar Gaddafi envoy offered to hold talks on the Libyan leader 's exit but the rebel National Libyan Council rejected negotiations with a leader they do not trust , a rebel spokesman said on Tuesday . 
Arab media had reported that the Libyan leader had reached out to the council to offer talks on Gaddafi 's departure , which is the central demand of rebels who have seized swathes of the country mainly in the east from the Libyan leader 's control . 
A council source on Monday told Reuters he had heard of a proposal that Gaddafi hand power to the head of parliament and leave Libya with a guaranteed sum of money . 
He had also said the council saw the cash element as an obstacle . 
In fiery and defiant speeches , Gaddafi has vowed to fight on and has told his supporters he will never leave Libya . 
Officials from the council , which is based in the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi , did not confirm any Gaddafi proposal on Monday , but on Tuesday a spokesman confirmed it was made . 
`` I confirm that we received contact from a Gaddafi representative seeking to negotiate Gaddafi 's exit , '' a media officer for the council , Mustafa Gheriani , told Reuters . 
`` We rejected this . 
We are not negotiating with someone who spilled Libyan blood and continues to do so . 
Why would we trust the guy today ? '' 
The Libyan government or Gaddafi 's representatives have not issued any comment on such a proposal but his son , Saadi Gaddafi , told an Arabic channel that if the leader did step down Libya would descend into civil war . 
The head of the rebel council , Mustafa Abdel Jalil , told Al Arabiya television by telephone : `` Now the first demand is that he announces his departure , and only after that perhaps Libyans will stop pursuing him for crimes . '' 
`` There are indirect contacts with the Americans at the presidential level , '' he added , without giving details . 
Al Jazeera also cited Abdel Jalil as saying that there was `` no chance for Gaddafi 's rule over Libya to continue '' . 
It quoted an Al Jazeera correspondent saying there were talks about mediation by a foreign state to secure a safe exit for Gaddafi .

2011-03-09,"A no-fly zone is among many issues and options being discussed , officials say Clear evidence of gross human rights violations could trigger action , one says Some members want to hear what the Arab League and African Union are thinking United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A no-fly zone over Libya was discussed Tuesday by the U.N. Security Council but little action was agreed to , officials said . 
The United Nations ' under-secretary-general for political affairs , Lynn Pascoe , who briefed the Security Council after a trip to North Africa , told reporters , `` There were lots of issues that were discussed this morning around this , and a no-fly zone was one of the issues . '' 
Security Council diplomats said a draft text including language on a no-fly zone is just part of contingency planning being done on behalf of the council . 
No draft has been formally introduced . 
One Security Council diplomat said that if there is a clear trigger -- for example gross , systematic human rights violations -- it could allow the council to act . 
Rebel advances come to ` screeching halt ' France 's U.N. ambassador , Gerard Araud , also said the council is studying all options , including a no-fly zone . 
Other members said they would want to see the Arab League and African Union positions before acting . 
One Western diplomat said his country is cautious and needs more information and a clearer picture from regional countries before acting on such a measure . 
The Chinese ambassador , Li Baodong , serving as Security Council president for the month , when asked about his country 's position on a no-fly zone , would not comment . 
Russia and China are usually reluctant to endorse military intervention .

2011-03-09,"By the CNN Wire Staff Gadhafi makes appearance in hotel lobby , does not speak to reporters U.S. president , British prime minister discuss Libya The U.S. State Department says departure would not exempt Gadhafi Deadly fighting occurs in Zawiya , a doctor says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fierce battles raged Tuesday for control of key Libyan cities in the east and west as Libya entered its fourth week of fighting and continued its descent into civil war . 
In the eastern oil city of Ras Lanuf , rebels fired antiaircraft guns after Libya 's air force carried out fresh raids . 
Video shot by Sky News showed that fighting was continuing in Zawiya , despite government assertions that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi controlled the oil-refining city . 
Hundreds of anti-government demonstrators could be seen marching in the street , many of them pumping their fists in the air . 
As the crackle of gunfire could be heard , the demonstrators ran toward the camera . 
Four men could be seen carrying a fifth , then putting him into an ambulance . 
A doctor who left the city in the morning told CNN that Gadhafi forces had fatally shot two fellow doctors in the main square and were shooting wounded civilians rather than allowing them to be treated . 
The city 's two medical clinics were closed , he said . 
Libyan rebels needs include a no-fly zone Military casualties were being taken from the city by ambulance , he said . 
CNN was not able to witness the fighting and could not independently confirm reports of what was happening there on Tuesday . 
Opposition officials accused Gadhafi of bombing water reserves in Ras Lanuf , the site of intense fighting in recent days . 
Rebels have seized several cities and the army has fought fiercely to reclaim some of them . 
On Tuesday , Gadhafi addressed a tribal group of youthful supporters in a talk broadcast on television and repeated his assertions that the nation 's youths have been misled and drugged by al Qaeda . 
`` For them , everybody 's their enemy , '' he said . 
`` They know nothing other than killing . '' 
He praised the Libyan standard of living as one that others in the world envy and called on his countrymen to defend it . 
`` They want to take your petrol , '' he said . 
`` This is what America , this is what the French , those colonialists , want . '' 
He cited people from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Algeria as among those who have joined the rebel forces -- `` hunting children who are not mature , who have certain deficiencies ; they offer them pills . 
This is what we understood so far . '' 
He called anti-government forces in Benghazi , a rebel-held town in the east , `` traitors '' and predicted that the pro-Gadhafi residents `` are going to throw them out . '' 
In Gadhafi 's stronghold , the capital city of Tripoli , about 100 journalists assembled during the evening in the lobby of a hotel after being told that Gadhafi would arrive . 
Nine hours later , just before midnight , his convoy of SUVs pulled up to the hotel . 
Gadhafi talks communism and Al Qaeda Shortly afterward , surrounded by his security detail , he strode into the lobby , waved at the throng of reporters , pumped his right fist several times into the air , retreated to a private room for an interview with a Turkish journalist , then left via a back door without addressing the reporters . 
The interview was to air Wednesday morning . 
The incident occurred hours after opposition members denied Tuesday that they have been negotiating an exit deal with Gadhafi , rejecting an assertion made earlier in the day by an opposition official . 
Gadhafi 's regime , too , denied having entered into negotiations with the rebels . 
Musa Ibrahim , a government spokesman , called reports of such negotiations `` lies . '' 
The Libyan opposition is composed not of a single monolithic group , but of various groups and individuals around the country whose shared goal is to see the 68-year-old ruler ousted . 
But their military skills tend to be rudimentary , at best , when compared with the relatively disciplined , well-armed pro-Gadhafi forces . 
`` There is no one here with military experience , but have a strong heart , '' said medical student Yahya Ali , who was manning an antiaircraft battery in the eastern Libyan town of Al-Brega after four hours of training . 
In Washington , U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said any departure from Libya of Gadhafi would not exempt him , his family or others from responsibility for their actions . 
`` We are going to hold him accountable , '' Crowley said . 
U.S. President Barack Obama discussed Libya on Tuesday with British Prime Minister David Cameron , the White House said in a statement . 
`` They agreed that the common objective in Libya must be an immediate end to brutality and violence ; the departure of Gadhafi from power as quickly as possible ; and a transition that meets the Libyan peoples ' aspirations for freedom , dignity , and a representative government , '' it said . 
Both leaders agreed to go ahead with planning responses , `` including surveillance , humanitarian assistance , enforcement of the arms embargo , and a no-fly zone . '' 
Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . 
`` Both the Libyan government and opposition forces need to allow unhindered access for aid organizations to assist civilians , '' Bill Frelick , refugee program director at Human Rights Watch , said Tuesday . 
`` People living in areas of heavy fighting in western Libya are now in dire need of medical aid and other assistance . '' 
The U.N. World Food Programme said Tuesday a convoy of trucks entered Libya headed for Benghazi , the rebel stronghold in eastern Libya . 
`` A convoy of trucks carrying 70 metric tons of high-energy , fortified date bars crossed the Egyptian border last night on its way to Benghazi . 
This would be the first delivery of food assistance from a U.N. agency to enter the country , '' the organization said in a statement . 
Plans for more food deliveries are being made , and tons of food have been delivered to the Egyptian border to help feed refugees , the organization said . 
This is part of a $ 39.2 million emergency operation designed to help feed more than 1 million people in Libya , Egypt and Tunisia over three months , the group said . 
Late Monday , the Gulf Cooperation Council said Libya had rejected its offer of humanitarian aid . 
The council is composed of Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . 
As reports continue to emerge of the government 's use of force against civilians , the international community has been left pondering strategies on how to end the violence . 
Three members of the U.N. Security Council -- France , Britain and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya , diplomatic sources at the United Nations said . 
And the Gulf Cooperation Council said Monday night they supported such an action . 
The Organization of the Islamic Conference , which represents 56 member states , said Tuesday that it wants the United Nations to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . 
But any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China , two permanent members of the council that wield veto power . 
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Karim told CNN on Tuesday that Libya is not misusing its air force and that any no-fly zone would be tantamount to an act of war . 
He said the Libyan government has asked for international monitors to verify that assertion . 
He said the military `` are taking purely defensive positions ; they are not taking offensive ones '' except in self-defense . 
The U.S. administration remains reluctant to move forward on a no-fly zone alone . 
`` Well , we want to see the international community support it , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Sky News on Tuesday . 
And the United States has also been reluctant to consider using force alone . 
`` We 'd like to see this resolved peacefully , '' Clinton said . 
`` We 'd like to see him go peacefully . 
We would like to see a new government come peacefully . 
But if that 's not possible , then we 're going to work with the international community . '' 
Asked if the United States was considering lifting the arms embargo , she said , `` Well , I think everything is being looked at , but it is difficult in the midst of this civil conflict that is going on now to even know how you would do that , because right now , it 's not clear what part of the country is actually under rebel control . '' 
The U.S. ambassador to Libya , Gene Cretz , has met in Rome and Cairo with Libyan opposition figures to get a sense of what is happening in the country , Crowley of the State Department said . 
He did not give names . 
Crowley said there have been meetings and phone conversations with members of the National Transitional Council and others . 
The State Department also spoke Friday with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa in a brief conversation in which each side gave its view , Crowley said . 
NATO said it has begun round-the-clock surveillance flights near Libya . 
With no clear end to the clashes in sight , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli . 
The fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . 
About 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the U.N. refugee agency has said . 
But 15,000 to 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border . 
Most of them are from Bangladesh , the U.N. refugee agency said . 
A man who said he was trapped in Misrata , a city east of Tripoli that has seen heavy clashes , said the rebels were running out of weapons -- but will continue to fight . 
`` Maybe tomorrow I 'll still be alive , I do n't know . 
I have nothing to lose , '' the man said . 
`` Nobody believes he will be alive tomorrow . 
We need support . ''

2011-03-09,"UNITED NATIONS | Wed Mar 9 , 2011 1:40 pm EST UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.N. Security Council is split on whether to authorize a no-fly zone over Libya as Britain and France consider tougher options for Tripoli , including setting up an escrow account for oil revenues , envoys said on Wednesday . 
Britain and France have been preparing a draft U.N. resolution that would authorize a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent airstrikes against civilians in the North African country where rebels are seeking to oust long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
The United States , however , has made clear to London and Paris that the administration of President Barack Obama is in the throes of a policy review and is not ready `` to go full steam ahead on a no-fly zone at the moment , '' a Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity . 
The British and French , however , are consulting with Washington and other allies so that they are ready to submit a draft resolution to the 15-nation Security Council immediately in the event of an `` egregious act '' against civilians by forces loyal to Gaddafi . 
`` If they were to bomb a school and kill a dozen children , the French and British are ready to move immediately with a draft on the no-fly zone issue , '' another diplomat said . 
But the idea of a no-fly zone lacks sufficient support at the moment among council members . 
Veto powers China and Russia dislike it , India and South Africa are skeptical , and the Americans are undecided , envoys said . 
`` If we put it on the table today , I do n't think there would be enough support for it , '' a diplomat said . 
But he added that no council members had categorically ruled it out . 
In order to pass , Security Council resolutions need nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the five permanent members , which also include the United States , Britain and France . 
`` Other options are being discussed , '' another diplomat said . 
`` One of those is an escrow account for Libyan oil revenues to prevent Gaddafi from getting all the nation 's oil money . '' 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague told parliament this week that a U.N.-administered escrow account similar to one set up for Iraq in the 1990s was an option being considered by Britain and its allies . 
The United Nations ' `` oil-for-food '' program in Iraq -- which allowed Iraq to sell oil in order to buy humanitarian goods -- was hit with allegations of widespread corruption , and U.N. officials have said privately that there is little appetite to get back in the business of administering oil revenues . 
Libya 's deputy U.N. ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi , whose denunciation of Gaddafi last month sparked dozens of defections of Libyan envoys worldwide , said he did not support the idea . 
`` There is no need for this , '' Dabbashi , a key member of the Libyan opposition , told Reuters . 
`` We have a government in place ready to take power . 
We do n't support an escrow account . '' 
Dabbashi said the Security Council should speed up talks on a no-fly zone and authorize it `` as soon as possible . '' 
Other options include modifying the Libyan arms embargo to allow the arming of the rebels . 
The arms embargo and other punitive measures were part of a Security Council sanctions resolution on February 26 . 
At the moment , an exemption would only be possible with the unanimous advance approval of all 15 council members . 
But Russia and China , which consider Libya to be in the throes of a full-scale civil war , are loath to have the Security Council taking sides against Gaddafi , diplomats said . 
They added that other council members dislike the idea of the council explicitly authorizing the arming of Libyan rebels . 
The key option , they said , remains the idea of a Security Council-authorized no-fly zone , which would be enforced by NATO but would ideally include participation of Arab and African nations to avoid the appearance of it being an exclusively U.S.-European military operation . 
`` Having Arabs and Africans would be helpful , '' a diplomat said , adding that even symbolic participation would be good . 
The French and British are also waiting to see whether the Arab League , African Union and European Union will formally agree to support a no-fly zone , diplomats said . 
Such a zone could take any number of forms , the envoys said , ranging from a military operation intended to shoot down any Libyan aircraft violating a flight ban to a zone where reconnaissance planes and satellites would monitor violations and pass the information to the International Criminal Court .

2011-03-10,"Old friends : Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez -LRB- left -RRB- meets Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a tent in Tripoli , 2004 . 
Gadhafi 's overseas backing is based on a shared anti-colonial narrative , say analysts Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez says Gadhafi , `` has been my friend for a long time '' China , Russia and Turkey would not support an invasion or no-fly zone , says analyst -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite facing intense pressure from parts of the international community to relinquish power , the Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi can still count on the continued support of some prominent world leaders , say analysts . 
Much of Gadhafi 's overseas backing is based on a shared anti-colonial narrative and the instincts of some regimes to undermine the norms of the international community , experts believe . 
So while many countries have criticized Gadhafi in the aftermath of protests that have left more than 1,000 people dead and many more injured , according to the U.N. , some of his allies , including Venezuela and Zimbabwe , refuse to publicly criticize Libya . 
`` There is a natural alignment between all regimes which are into power maximization , that is , regimes trying to accumulate as much power as they can for themselves , '' says Barak Seener , a Middle East research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute , a London-based think tank . 
Who is the opposition in Libya ? 
`` Venezuela , for example , also has close links with Iran , '' added Seener . 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called for an international good will commission to mediate in Libya ; in contrast the U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime . 
On Monday , Chavez said Gadhafi , `` has been my friend and our friend for a long time , '' in remarks broadcast on Venezuelan state television . 
And in comments made on Thursday , Chavez described alleged preparations to invade Libya as `` a madness , and in front of that madness , as always , the Yankee empire that tries to dominate the world , at the cost of fire and blood . '' 
The former Cuban President Fidel Castro on Thursday also condemned what he described as the inevitable U.S.-backed invasion of Libya by NATO to get its hands on that country 's oil . 
Seener said that countries with a record of `` domestic abuse , '' such as limiting freedom of speech and having no independent judiciary , have no sense of accountability to their people in the same way that elected powers do and that lack of perceived accountability tends to spill over into their foreign polices . 
Another close allay of Gadhafi is Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe . 
Libya has good relations with Zimbabwe , which has few international friends , says Jane Kinninmont , senior research fellow at the think tank Chatham House . 
`` She notes the contrast with Sudan , which was able to count on a far broader range of allies , including China and most of the Arab world , when it faced condemnation from the West over the ethnic conflict in Darfur '' . 
She adds that , for example , during the bloody ethnic conflict in the Sudanese region of Darfur , Sudan faced international condemnation but `` did still have its friends in the international world . '' 
There is also a second group of nations -- including China , Russia and Turkey -- which while unlikely to openly back Gadhafi , would not support an invasion and they would also be against a no-fly zone , said Seener . 
`` It is not simply a case of being anti-Western . 
Turkey for example is increasing diplomatic and economic links with Iran and as it does so it is entering the Iranian sphere of influence . 
They will not condemn what Gadhafi is doing in Libya , '' says Seener . 
Despite the continued backing of Gadhafi by his allies , some analysts predict a sorry end for the leader . 
Scott Horton , an international lawyer said : `` Deposed dictators now are subject to lawsuits , both civil suits by the governments that succeeded them and human rights suits , and they wind up being prosecuted and successfully sued . '' 
However , Barak Barfi of the New America Foundation said : `` I think there is a very good possibility he 'll fight to the death knowing he has very few options . ''

2011-03-10,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan opposition leader speaks to CNN NEW : The United Nations cites unconfirmed reports of violence against children `` Messengers from Gadhafi '' warn Zuwarah residents `` The longer the situation carries on , the more blood is shed '' Gadhafi 's regime offers reward for capturing a top opposition figure Tune in to `` AC360 '' for the latest on what 's next for Libya , the opposition and Moammar Gadhafi . 
Watch `` AC360 '' at 10 p.m. ET Wednesday on CNN . 
Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of the interim government in eastern Libya pleaded Wednesday for the international community to move quickly to impose a no-fly zone over Libya , declaring that any delay would result in more casualties . 
`` It has to be immediate action , '' Mustafa Abdul-Jalil told CNN in an exclusive interview in this eastern opposition stronghold . 
`` The longer the situation carries on , the more blood is shed . 
That 's the message that we want to send to the international community . 
They have to live up to their responsibility with regards to this . '' 
After the uprising began February 15 , Abdul-Jalil was among the government officials who broke with the regime . 
He has gone on to lead the opposition 's National Transitional Council , a 31-member group representing most regions in Libya . 
The group has met in Benghazi , an eastern town that has become an opposition stronghold . 
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi told a Turkish reporter in an interview Tuesday that the imposition of a no-fly zone would simply unite the Libyan people behind him . 
`` They will be united against the new attempt for occupation and imperialistic interests and it will be clear that they are conspiring against Libya , '' he said . 
`` It will also be clear that the intentions are to control Libya 's oil , choke Libya 's liberty , land and people . '' 
Secret voices speak out in Libya Massive explosions rock Libyan oil town The risks of a Libya no-fly zone Abdul-Jalil 's remarks came shortly after Gadhafi 's regime announced a reward for Abdul-Jalil 's capture , branding him `` an agent spy . '' 
In an `` urgent '' banner on state television , the government said its General Administration for Criminal Investigation was offering 500,000 Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 410,900 U.S. -RRB- `` for whoever captures and hands over '' the `` agent spy '' Abdul-Jalil , and `` another offer of 200,000 Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 164,300 U.S. -RRB- for whoever offers information leading to his actual arrest . '' 
In a letter to the U.N. General Assembly , the transitional council asked that it be recognized as `` the sole representative of all Libya . '' 
It also asked the international community to `` fulfill its obligations to protect the Libyan people from any further genocide and crimes against humanity without any direct military intervention on Libyan soil . '' 
The letter , which was dated March 5 , was made public Wednesday . 
The move to target Abdul-Jalil came as Gadhafi fought to advance against rebels who have taken control of many parts of the country . 
On Wednesday , pro-Gadhafi forces launched fresh attacks on Ras Lanuf , using planes and heavy artillery in an effort to retake the eastern oil city . 
Opposition fighters , armed with anti-aircraft guns and Soviet rifles , were outgunned by the heavily armed pro-Gadhafi forces . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported that an intense artillery bombardment was under way on the western edge of Ras Lanuf , where ambulances lined up to the emergency ward at Ras Lanuf 's only hospital to drop off the wounded . 
More than 25 people were wounded , said Dr. Ali Al-Bart , at Ras Lanuf Hospital . 
`` It 's very bad , the situation is very bad , '' he said . 
Opposition efforts remained , but appeared weak . 
Ahmed Faturi left his clothing store in Benghazi to carry a SAM-7 surface-to-air missile , but knew he had little chance of hitting a plane with it . 
And he expressed little hope that a no-fly zone would ever materialize . 
`` Just talk , '' he said . 
A few days ago , the rebel forces were advancing steadily westward toward Gadhafi 's stronghold in the capital city of Tripoli . 
But that advancement appears to have reversed . 
In Ras Lanuf , an oil storage tank to the west was hit in the fighting , though it was not clear who was responsible . 
Libyan state television reported that `` armed groups supported by al Qaeda blew up an oil tank as they withdrew from Ras Lanuf against the advancing Libyan armed forces . '' 
The attack marked the first time since the rebellion began more than three weeks ago that Libya 's oil infrastructure has been damaged . 
Gadhafi has shown no sign of giving up . 
On state television , he again insisted Tuesday night that youths misled and drugged by al Qaeda were to blame for the fighting . 
`` For them , everybody 's their enemy , '' Gadhafi said . 
`` They know nothing other than killing . '' 
Inside the mind of a dictator The speech was recorded earlier Tuesday when Gadhafi addressed a youth group of tribal supporters , urging them to defend Libya from those who envy its standard of living . 
`` They want to take your petrol , '' he said . 
`` This is what America , this is what the French , those colonialists , want . '' 
A private Libyan aircraft crossed Greek airspace Wednesday en route to Cairo , Egypt , and the pilot said there were two passengers on board , according to Greek civil aviation authorities . 
The pilot did not identify the passengers , aviation authorities said . 
Multiple media reports said the plane landed in Cairo . 
The development raised questions about whether Libyan officials may have flown to Cairo . 
On Tuesday , an opposition member said Gadhafi was negotiating an exit deal , but other opposition members and the government denied that . 
In the fourth week of what has become a civil war , Gadhafi 's regime has held on to the capital , while losing control to the opposition in some other areas . 
Benghazi , in eastern Libya , is an opposition stronghold . 
People in some towns in the western part of the country told CNN Wednesday their areas were under rebel control . 
In Zuwarah , two sources said the city , which is located between Zawiya and the country 's western border , with Tunisia , was surrounded by Gadhafi supporters but most shops and banks were operating normally . 
A witness described the scene as tense , with schools , government offices and businesses closed . 
Demonstrations were no longer being held because , the witness said , `` There is no one to protest against . '' 
Two Zuwarah residents said `` messengers from Gadhafi '' had warned local leaders Wednesday to surrender or face attack . 
The `` messengers '' told the leaders that replacing the pre-Gadhafi regime flag in the city with the government 's green flag would be interpreted as a sign of solidarity with the regime , the sources said . 
They added that there had been implicit threats against Zuwarah to bomb two nearby facilities : a petro-chemical plant 15 kilometers away and a gas export facility 30 kilometers away . 
In Zawiya , two sources said the fighting continued in the city center Wednesday , but to a lesser extent than on Tuesday . 
They said the opposition occupied the city center , which was surrounded by the military . 
On the outskirts of the city , pro-Gadhafi rallies were being held , they said . 
But Libyan television reported that Gadhafi supporters were celebrating `` the liberation of the town from the armed terrorist elements backed by al Qaeda '' in the main square . 
Access to the city was limited . 
A witness told CNN she tried to travel from Tripoli to Zawiya but was turned away at various checkpoints . 
Communications were so difficult that CNN was not able to talk with anyone in the city . 
One Zawiya resident , who told CNN she had to make the 40-minute trip to Tripoli to make a phone call , said there had been no electricity in Zawiya for the previous day . 
In addition , two medical clinics that were shut Tuesday by the military remained closed Wednesday , she said . 
Another source who fled Zawiya Tuesday for the Tunisian border said many bodies in the city lay unclaimed because relatives -- fearing violence -- would not go to graveyards to bury them . 
Residents of Zuwarah sent weapons , explosives , and medical supplies via a small boat to Zawiya , the witness said . 
The man who drove the boat dropped the supplies immediately upon arrival and fled out of fear . 
Libyan state TV showed video of government supporters cheering in Zawiya 's streets and hoisting the government flag on Wednesday . 
Witnesses said fear remained widespread in the capital , where schools were closed . 
A resident said she called several banks to ask about taking out money but was told that there was a shortage of cash . 
Nalut was under opposition control and calm Wednesday , a witness said . 
In Ajdabiya and Misrata , spokesmen for opposition groups said those towns remained under opposition control and were calm as well . 
Two doctors in Misrata said medical supplies were in short supply . 
More than 80 people remained at Central Misrata Hospital recovering from wounds suffered Sunday in fighting , they said . 
Libya 's government sought Wednesday to influence international sentiment , announcing that Libya 's secretary of state for international relations will travel to Portugal , Greece and Malta on an exploratory fact-finding mission that may include other destinations . 
Libya has invited British , French , Dutch and German fact-finding teams to Libya to examine reports of aerial bombardment and massacres . 
Libya had received no response from any of the invitees . 
The decision about whether to impose a no-fly zone is a complicated one , said Nicholas Burns , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO . 
`` There 's no assurance that the imposition of even a no-fly zone would make a decisive difference in the battle , '' Burns said . 
`` Gadhafi has ground forces . 
He has artillery , he has a mercenary army . 
That 's 95 percent of the fighting under way in Libya . '' 
And it would not prove to be a panacea , the head of the U.S. Marine Corps told lawmakers Tuesday . 
Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos said that a no-fly zone would do little to thwart Libya 's helicopters , which he called `` their greatest threat . '' 
A no-fly zone would typically be enforced by fighter jets whose speed and altitude make it difficult to target helicopters , which move low and slow , Amos said . 
For its part , Libya said it was not misusing its air force . 
Any no-fly zone would be tantamount to an act of war , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Karim said Tuesday . 
The military , he said , `` are taking purely defensive positions ; they are not taking offensive ones . '' 
He said the Libyan government has asked for international monitors to verify that assertion . 
The protests against the 68-year-old Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought his ouster after nearly 42 years of rule . 
Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . 
And the war has forced out 215,000 people , many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , the U.N. refugee agency has said . 
While many countries chartered planes and dispatched ships to whisk away their citizens to safety , those stuck at the border are sheltered in cramped , unsanitary quarters with little to eat . 
The United Nations ' special representative for children and armed conflict , Radhika Coomaraswamy , said her office had received unconfirmed reports of violence against children , `` including killing and maiming and use of children as combatants and the denial of humanitarian access . '' 
Valerie Amos , the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , called for all Libyan civilians to be protected . 
`` I am deeply concerned about the reportedly indiscriminate nature of the fighting , and particularly the use of heavy artillery and aerial bombardments , '' she said in a statement . 
`` We are also hearing reports of hospital closures at the very time when people most need medical care . '' 
The U.N. World Food Programme has initiated a $ 39.2 million emergency operation intended to provide food to more than 1 million people in Libya , Egypt and Tunisia over a three-month period . 
In the latest sign of international solidarity with the Libyan opposition , a group of people entered a home in London Wednesday owned by Saif Gadhafi , the Libyan leader 's son who has spoken on behalf of the regime in recent weeks . 
They could be seen hanging a banner out an upstairs window with a picture of Gadhafi in a red circle with a line through it . 
`` Out of Libya , '' the sign says , `` Out of London . '' 
London Metropolitan police said only the situation was `` being treated as a civil matter . ''

2011-03-10,"RAS LANUF , Libya | Thu Mar 10 , 2011 6:41 pm EST RAS LANUF , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan tanks fired on rebel positions around the oil port of Ras Lanuf and warplanes hit another oil hub further east Thursday as Muammar Gaddafi carried counter-attacks deeper into the insurgent heartland . 
In the west , Gaddafi 's army laid siege to try to starve out insurgents clinging to parts of the shattered city of Zawiyah , strategically significant because it is close to his powerbase in the capital Tripoli , after fierce see-saw battles this week . 
But the rebels took an important step toward international legitimacy when France recognized their national council . 
While oil prices have been kept high by the bombardments in the east of the Arab North African state , there was no clear sign of deliberate intent by Gaddafi to ruin oil infrastructure . 
NATO and the European Union were looking into imposing a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya to stop the government using jets and helicopters against the outgunned rebels , who seized a string of cities east and west of Tripoli early in the three-week-old war to end Gaddafi 's 41 years of iron-fisted rule . 
Despite rebel appeals to take the skies away from Gaddafi 's forces , no quick action was expected as NATO has made clear it needs wider , United Nations endorsement for such a move . 
More than 500 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , Gaddafi 's warplanes and gunboats off the Mediterranean coast bombarded rebels around Ras Lanuf , with projectiles crashing close to a building of the Libyan Emirates Oil Refinery Company . 
There was a series of air strikes , and insurgents fired anti-aircraft guns toward warplanes and rockets out to sea toward Gaddafi 's naval forces , without visible effect . 
Two rebel fighters said they saw Ras Lanuf 's residential area , including the vicinity of its hospital , get bombed and that government forces had fired rockets from sea , air and ground . 
There was no apparent damage to the hospital . 
Later , at least two tanks were seen bearing down on ragged rebel lines outside Ras Lanuf and opening fire . 
The rebels also reported an air strike on Brega , another oil port 90 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- east of Ras Lanuf , indicating that Gaddafi loyalists had not only halted a westwards insurgent push in its tracks but were making inroads into the rebels ' eastern centers . 
State television said rebels had been ousted from the port and airport of Es Sider , a further oil terminus about 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- up the coast west of Ras Lanuf . 
OPEC member Libya was turning away tankers from ports as storage depots dried up because of supply disruptions caused by the fighting . 
Libya 's oil trade has virtually been paralyzed as banks refuse to clear payments in dollars due to U.S. sanctions , cutting off major importers such as Italy and France . 
The intensified fighting near oil installations kept crude prices hovering near recent 2.5-year highs , with Brent crude trading at $ 114.55 a barrel . 
The rebels , hitherto bursting with confidence that they would soon charge hundreds of km -LRB- miles -RRB- up the Mediterranean desert coast , overwhelming any resistance , to capture Gaddafi 's main bastion Tripoli , now conceded they were struggling to hold ground against the government 's vastly superior firepower . '' 
-LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- might take it . 
With planes , tanks , mortars and rockets , he might take it , '' said rebel fighter Basim Khaled . 
`` A no-fly zone would be great , '' said rebel fighter Salem al-Burqy , echoing the view of many beleaguered cohorts . 
Gaddafi 's counter-offensive has stymied a rebel advance from their eastern power base of Benghazi . 
They were forced to withdraw from the front-line town of Bin Jawad , just west of Ras Lanuf , after coming under heavy shelling earlier this week . 
One fighter said rebels had retaken the heart of Zawiyah , the closest city -- 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west -- to Tripoli , from the army overnight . 
Zawiyah 's center appeared to change hands twice during the day in a fierce battle . 
`` We fought until after three in the morning . 
It 's all quiet here this morning , '' said the insurgent , named Ibrahim , by phone . 
Mohamed , a Libyan in exile abroad who got through to a relative on the outskirts of Zawiyah Thursday morning , said it was simply not clear who was winning the battle for the city but the army had it under siege to break the rebels ' will . 
`` Yesterday -LRB- rebel sympathizers -RRB- tried to bring food and medicine from Subratha but failed . 
Government troops surround Zawiyah from everywhere . 
It is unclear who controls the center . 
It changes all the time . 
It 's street to street fighting . '' 
Authorities have kept journalists away from Zawiyah . 
France became the first significant country Thursday to recognize the rebel Libyan National Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . 
An official at President Nicolas Sarkozy 's office said France would send an ambassador to Benghazi and receive a Libyan envoy in Paris . 
He was speaking after Sarkozy met officials from the Libyan National Council . 
Britain 's Foreign Office suggested it could make the same opening as France , saying Libyan National Council members were `` valid interlocutors '' and Gaddafi should step down now . 
`` The UK recognizes states , not governments . 
The interim national council are valid interlocutors , with whom we wish to work closely , '' a Foreign Office spokesman said . 
The U.S. Defense Department said it was preparing a `` full range '' of military options for Libya , including a no-fly zone . 
NATO ministers were to weigh up options at talks in Brussels on Thursday . 
Military officers said a zone could be set up quickly . 
Rebel forces have appealed to Washington and its allies to impose a no-fly zone to deny Gaddafi 's forces the advantage of using warplanes and prevent him moving troops by helicopter . 
A no-fly zone could also help protect civilians who have been caught in the fighting , with scores if not more people reported killed so far in cities like Zawiyah . 
A burgeoning humanitarian emergency could hasten a no-fly decision . 
CALL TO AVOID SHOOTING AT CIVILIANS In Geneva , the International Committee of the Red Cross said Libya had descended into civil war with increasing numbers of wounded civilians arriving in hospitals in the east . 
ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called on Libyan authorities to grant the humanitarian agency access to western areas including the capital Tripoli and reminded both sides that civilians and medical facilities must not be targeted . 
General Raymond Odierno , commander of the U.S. Joint Forces Command , said the U.S. military was probably capable of establishing a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya `` within a couple of days '' if the international community so decided . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made it clear imposing a no-fly zone is a matter for the United Nations and should not be a U.S.-led initiative . 
Russia and China , permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , oppose the idea , which could entail bombing Libyan air defenses as a first step . 
Russia said Thursday military intervention would be unacceptable , but acted to help isolate Gaddafi by banning all weapons sales to Libya , effectively suspending major arms contracts with his government . 
Italy , whose bases could play a critical role in any military action , has said it will back any decisions taken by NATO , the EU or the United Nations , clearing the way for U.S. naval forces based in Naples to be deployed if needed . 
Two members of Libya 's opposition council visited the European Parliament Wednesday and said they wanted EU moral support , political recognition and a no-fly zone shielding the territory they hold -- but not any form of military intervention in a country sensitive about former colonial domination . 
Counter-attacks by Gaddafi loyalists suggest the flamboyant leader , in power since a 1969 coup , will not go as quietly or quickly as fellow leaders in Egypt and Tunisia did in a tide of popular unrest rolling across the Arab world . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It is simply a fantasy he wo n't attack them . 
When loyalists can not overtake the strong-hold of the rebels , the pro-Gadi camp is likely to destroy the enemy 's wealth i.e. oil facilities . 
What a tragedy the world is watching unfold in front of us . 
Not for Gaddafi or the rebels but for the hundreds of innocent men women and children who a getting killed as a result of this battle . 
Every day I read in news items of what the world s powers are going to do or can do but the bottom line while they are all thinking about it nothing is getting done . 
The truth is that no matter what they say they are doing they in fact are waiting to see how this conflict unfolds and then they can take the appropriate action that will not leave them with egg on their face . 
Hilary Clinton like a school kid when asked to participate is saying `` We will if you will `` . 
Can we really blame the Americans for this attitude when they are already extremely unpopular because of their involvement in other Arab world issues , not forgetting Israel . 
Europe don t seem to be rushing to Hilary s aid and are making statements such as `` we could have this No fly zone in place very quickly if necessary `` but they are not implemeting it , and if Italy are seen to be pro rebels they have a lot to lose if Gaddafi wins . 
The Russians and China have their own agendas for reasons similar to Italy , what if Gaddafi wins , all their trade with Lybia goes down the pan . 
Finally the Arab world , they may not like Gaddafi but they have seen rebellions in other Arab countries oust their presidents , a win for the rebels in Lybia would really open the flood gates for the remaining Arab world . 
Saudia rulers have already stated that protests in their country will not be allowed so a win for Gaddafi will strengthen their position . 
The bottom line is that the Lybian rebels based on what they saw in Egypt hoped they could topple Gaddafi easily , and if needed the rest of the world would support them . 
Well I m sorry folks but it appears that the rest of the world are thinking about it and thinking about and thinking about it . 
`` Libya will turn into civil war if my father steps down '' , so said by Gaddafi 's son . 
The civil war already started 3 weeks ago , it will end when his father flees or faces death penalty . 
`` The no-fly zone has to be sanctioned by U.N. security council '' , so said by Hillary Clinton . 
Why participation in Afghan and Iraq wars were not ?

2011-03-10,"GENEVA | Thu Mar 10 , 2011 11:55 am EST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's aerial bombing of civilians and use of heavy weapons on city streets must be investigated as possible crimes against humanity , the top U.N. human rights official said on Thursday . 
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also said she had received accounts of executions , rapes and disappearances in the north African country . 
Reports of the `` continued aerial bombardment of civilians and the use of military grade weapons and tanks on city streets '' were outrageous and `` would be investigated as possible crimes against humanity , '' the former U.N. war crimes judge said . 
Pillay , noting that the Security Council had referred Libya to the International Criminal Court , said security forces should not think they could commit crimes without facing prosecution . 
Libyan tanks fired on rebel positions around the oil port of Ras Lanuf and warplanes hit another oil hub further east on Thursday as Muammar Gaddafi carried counter-attacks deeper into the insurgent heartland . 
Libya has descended into civil war with increasing numbers of wounded civilians arriving in hospitals in eastern cities , the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- said . 
ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called on Libyan authorities to grant the humanitarian agency access to western areas , including the capital Tripoli , to assess needs . 
`` We have now a non-international armed conflict , or what you would call civil war , '' Kellenberger told a news conference . 
`` We see increasing numbers of wounded arriving at hospitals in the east and we are extremely worried . '' 
The ICRC , one of the few international aid agencies in Libya , has set up a base in rebel-held Benghazi in the east where it is helping to perform surgery and supply hospitals . 
Kellenberger had no overall casualty figures for the country or reports from the western city of Zawiyah , which appeared to change hands twice on Wednesday . 
Valerie Amos , U.N. emergency relief coordinator , said of Zawiyah in the U.N. 's latest report : `` Residents reported bullets being fired , with women and children being killed and families trapped in their homes . '' 
Kellenber said fighting had intensified and doctors had witnessed a sharp rise in casualties , with at least 22 killed and 40 wounded in Misrata after air strikes . 
Some 55 wounded were treated in Ajdabiyah hospital in the east this week . 
Top Libyan authorities , whom he declined to name , had told him there was no need for outside help in the areas held by Libyan forces , said Kellenberger , a former Swiss diplomat . 
`` We do n't know what the humanitarian needs are in areas controlled by Tripoli . 
I was told everything is under control , all hospitals are working perfectly , there is no need for external humanitarian assistance , '' he said . 
`` Our first priority is to have access to areas controlled by Tripoli . '' 
U.N. agencies remain shut out from Libya for security reasons , but are increasingly alarmed at sketchy reports of mounting casualties in besieged cities , U.N. officials said on Wednesday .

Yet the hardships and violence poured onto the people of Libya by Gaddafi pale in comparison to the murderous onslaught poured onto the people of Iraq by America for the sake of oil . 
American troops , from the air and on the ground , murdered tens of thousands of Iraqi humans in the most horrific ways -- a people that had never harmed America . 
American troops murdered Iraqi men , women and children using bombs -LRB- including chemical phosphorous bombs -RRB- , aerial rockets , shoulder fired rockets , artillery shrapnel , helicopter gunships , and plain old assault rifles and pistols . 
American shrapnel passing through the abdomens of children , for the cause of the American military-industrial complex . 
Tens of thousands of Iraqi men , women and children were killed by American troops . 
Literally millions of Iraqi families were driven from their homes , tearing the families apart . 
American troops , acting as secret police , for years , performed night-time roundups of anybody in Iraq the voiced opposition , labeling them as terrorists . 
American troops tortured thousands and killed in the Abu Gareb prison , and many photographs exist , and many photographs were destroyed . 
In America , we stand proud of our individual rights to bear arms . 
Yet American troops imprisoned and sometimes executed many innocent Iraqi men because they dared to keep a gun in their bedroom to defend their family . 
Compared to America , Gaddafi is not such a bad guy perhaps . 
And , of course , Abraham Lincoln made war against his own people who rebelled . 
He killed over 500,000 fellow Americans , whose bodies can be found today in mass graves scattered across eastern America . 
The UN should perhaps look at America for war crimes .

2011-03-10,"\* France says Libyan rebel council legitimate reps of people \* Tripoli calls it interference \* EU , NATO begin talks in Brussels to agree common policy -LRB- adds Libyan reaction , European reaction , LNC quote -RRB- PARIS , March 10 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - France recognized the Libyan National Council , a rebel body fighting to oust Muammar Gaddafi , as the legitimate representative of Libya 's people on Thursday , the first country to make the move . 
People near the National Council 's headquarters in Benghazi cheered , honked horns and some fired guns in air to celebrate the news . 
The Libyan government called it a `` damaging intervention in Libya 's internal affairs '' . 
The announcement came as NATO and the European Union begin talks on Thursday on a possible `` no-fly '' zone over Libya after some of the fiercest fighting of the three-week-old uprising against Muammar Gaddafi . 
-LRB- ID : LDE72900H -RRB- `` France recognizes the National Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . 
There will be an exchange of ambassadors between Paris and Benghazi , '' said an official at the Elysee Palace offices of President Nicolas Sarkozy after he met two representatives of the Libyan National Council -LRB- LNC -RRB- . 
Speaking after meeting Sarkozy , Mahmoud Jebril , a member of the LNC , said France would unveil a `` global strategic plan '' to the European Union on Friday to try to resolve the crisis . 
`` The plan would be at a -LRB- European -RRB- level to save the Libyan people from the suffering and massacre being perpetrated against it and to safeguard the future and the country . '' 
Rebel representatives in Benghazi said France was the first country in the world to give them formal diplomatic recognition . 
A French diplomatic source said Paris ' decision was `` a political signal of encouragement '' and that it hoped the European Union would follow suit . '' 
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle sounded a cautious note . 
`` This will have to wait for consultations held by the EU and the Special Representative of the United Nations . 
Before we undertake such political steps , we must of course know who we 're dealing with . '' 
A Spanish government spokesman told Reuters Spain would join the rest of Europe in a common decision out of meetings today and tomorrow , while Austrian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger said the talks with the LNC `` were very welcome . 
A spokesman at Britain 's Foreign Office said members of the Libyan rebel council were `` valid interlocutors '' . 
-LRB- ID : nLDE7291FA -RRB- European Union foreign ministers were meeting in Brussels on Thursday and EU leaders are due to meet there on Friday , in part to discuss Libya . 
NATO defense ministers were also meeting . 
-LRB- ID : nLDE7281SR -RRB- One EU diplomat said the 27-member EU was exploring the possibility of opening a representative office in east Libya but was only in the early stages of developing the idea . 
France , slow like most other countries to respond when the upheaval in North Africa started in Tunisia , a former colony , is seeking to play a more decisive role in events in Libya . 
`` We are totally in sync -LRB- with Germany -RRB- to say that Colonel Gaddafi is discredited , he must go and we must enter in dialogue with new Libyan officials '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said . 
An unidentified Libyan foreign ministry official told the official news agency Jana , France 's decision could mean Gaddafi 's government severs ties with Paris .

2011-03-10,"GENEVA | Thu Mar 10 , 2011 6:19 am EST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya has descended into civil war with increasing numbers of wounded civilians arriving in hospitals in eastern cities , the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- said on Thursday . 
ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called on Libyan authorities to grant the humanitarian agency access to western areas including the capital Tripoli so as to assess needs . 
He also reminded both Libyan forces and insurgents that under international humanitarian law it is prohibited to target civilians , medical facilities and ambulances . 
`` We have now a non-international armed conflict , or what you would call civil war , '' Kellenberger told a news conference . 
`` We see increasing numbers of wounded arriving at hospitals in the east and we are extremely worried . '' 
The ICRC , one of the few international aid agencies in Libya , has set up a base in rebel-held Benghazi in the east where it is helping to perform war surgery and supply hospitals . 
Kellenberger said he had no overall casualty figures for the country or reports on the western city of Zawiyah , which appeared to change hands twice during the day on Wednesday in a hard-fought battle . 
But he said that fighting had intensified and local doctors had seen a sharp rise in casualties , with at least 22 bodies and 40 wounded in Misrata after recent air strikes . 
Some 55 wounded were treated in Ajdabiyah hospital in the east this week . 
Top Libyan authorities whom he declined to identify had personally told him there was no need for outside help in the areas held by Libyan forces , according to Kellenberger , a former Swiss diplomat . 
`` We do n't know what the humanitarian needs are in areas controlled by Tripoli . 
I was told everything is under control , all hospitals are working perfectly , there is no need for external humanitarian assistance , '' he said . 
`` You can only assist people when you have access . 
Our first priority is to have access to areas controlled by Tripoli . '' 
U.N. agencies remain shut out from Libya for security reasons , but are increasingly alarmed at sketchy reports of mounting casualties and needs in besieged cities , U.N. officials said on Wednesday .

2011-03-10,"Anti-Gaddafi rebels shoot after hearing an incoming aircraft at a checkpoint near the oil facility of Ras Lanuf March 7 , 2011 . 
WASHINGTON | Thu Mar 10 , 2011 6:46 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As the Obama administration wrestles over what to do about Libya , the voices on Capitol Hill offer no consensus on military action . 
Influential senators John McCain , a Republican , and John Kerry , a Democrat , have kept up a drumbeat for U.S. military action such as a `` no-fly '' zone to aid the rebels fighting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
But other senior lawmakers , like Republicans Senator Richard Lugar and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , are warning against getting the United States into a Libyan war . 
The Senate 's top Republican , Mitch McConnell , has suggested possibly arming the Libyan rebels , but other leaders in Congress have been more vague . 
Analysts say Congress may be waiting for a clear steer from the commander in chief , President Obama . 
`` It seems very clear there is not a consensus about what to do , and that is natural . 
Any time you have a crisis like this you are going to look for leadership from the executive branch , '' said foreign policy analyst Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute think-tank in Washington . 
`` My guess is that Obama will not authorize a no-fly zone without clear support from Congress and allies , '' said Henry Nau , political science professor at George Washington University . 
Obama `` has not taken a clear lead in arguing for that with either Congress or NATO . '' 
Ros-Lehtinen , a foreign policy hawk and chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , told Reuters the situation in Libya was rapidly evolving . 
`` At this time , I do not believe it is in our national security interest for the U.S. to intervene militarily , '' she said . 
Although she is a big critic of Gaddafi , Ros-Lehtinen also called proposals to arm opposition forces in Libya misguided , saying the U.S. knew very little about them and this could have `` grave consequences for U.S. interests . '' 
Some of Obama 's Democrats , like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein , also say United States should avoid any military involvement in Libya . 
`` We 're in two other wars . 
There are problems in Iraq . 
There 's an expected major spring offensive in Afghanistan , we have problems with Pakistan ... It 's a civil war within the country -LRB- Libya -RRB- , '' Feinstein said outside the Senate . 
`` Even a no-fly zone would technically be an act of war , '' she said . 
Lugar , the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , says that any major military action to support anti-Gaddafi forces would require a vote of Congress . 
On Thursday , the top U.S. spy chief told lawmakers Gaddafi 's forces were likely to prevail in the long run against rebels fighting to end his 41-year rule . 
National Intelligence Director James Clapper 's assessment may lead to louder calls in Congress for Obama to take swift military action to help the rebels . 
Kerry , who has advocated taking out runways used by Gaddafi 's forces , told Reuters he feared Washington would look `` feckless '' down the road if it did not try to help the rebels . 
He and McCain have endorsed preparing a no-fly zone , in which the United States and its allies would stop Gaddafi 's aircraft from firing on the rebels . 
Some congressional leaders have issued cautious statements that condemn Gaddafi but do n't endorse or oppose military action for now . 
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has stressed that any action that the U.S. takes must be in line with broader U.S. interests in the region . 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the United Nations and the international community should be committed to `` examining all options - including a no-fly zone - that may be necessary to protect innocent civilians and ensure the democratic aspirations of the Libyan people are heard . ''

2011-03-11,"By the CNN Wire Staff Reporter : Gadhafi has the momentum now NEW : Gadhafi 's government suspends diplomatic relations with France , a minister says NEW : The U.S. broadens its sanctions , freezing assets of Gadhafi 's relatives and officials The EU council calls for Gadhafi 's departure Pro-Gadhafi forces steadily bombarded the oil port city of Ras Lanuf Ras Lanuf , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The military forces of Moammar Gadhafi on Friday pounded Ras Lanuf , the key oil port once in the hands of rebel forces , with its leadership confidently vowing to retake all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure . 
Even as it targeted its domestic enemies , the Tripoli government continued to parry with leaders around the globe . 
Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim , for instance , said Friday that Libya has suspended diplomatic relations with France , one day after the French government recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country . 
In Ras Lanuf , pro-Gadhafi forces cranked up an intense and steady bombardment of the city , believed to be by rocket , artillery and tank fire . 
A storage tank at an oil refinery was on fire after an air raid there . 
`` We saw a bomb fall about a kilometer to the southwest of the refinery , and moments later saw thick black smoke rising from the refinery . 
We do n't know , and no one we spoke to could say with any level of certainty or veracity , what caused the fire , '' said CNN Correspondent Ben Wedeman . 
Dozens of pickup trucks and cars belonging to the opposition were heading away from the city amid fear that Libyan forces were advancing as the bombardment continued . 
The rebels evacuated to a checkpoint outside the town , but that and other rebel positions also were targeted by airstrikes . 
Rebel forces retreat in Libya Are Libyan rebels losing momentum ? 
NATO awaits U.N. mandate on Libya Rebels said the eastern city has been essentially empty as civilians fled and opposition forces retreated from sustained attacks . 
On Thursday , state media said the town was `` cleansed '' of the fighters . 
This reflects the turn in fortunes for Gadhafi 's well-equipped military , which has gained an upper hand after rebel fighters seized ground across Libya . 
Along with its offensive in Ras Lanuf , government soldiers beat back rebels Thursday in Zawiya east of the capital , Tripoli . 
Zawiya 's Martyrs ' Square was littered with the bombed-out , scorched carcasses of army tanks and other military vehicles . 
Workers swept up the evidence as Gadhafi supporters chanted slogans and waved green flags . 
Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , one of Gadhafi 's sons and a spokesman for the regime , vowed Thursday to retake other areas in eastern Libya that were controlled by the opposition and warned the international community that Libyans wo n't welcome NATO and Americans . 
NATO is contemplating the establishment of a no-fly zone , but says it needs a clear U.N. mandate to do it . 
`` I receive hundreds of calls from the east daily , and they are saying , ` Save us . ' 
They are begging us and pleading for us to save them , and my answer is two words . 
Listen to me , and I want those armed groups to listen to me real well , and I want our people in the east to hear this as well : We 're coming , '' he said . 
Saif al-Islam Gadhafi is one of two Moammar Gadhafi sons who share the first name Saif . 
On the diplomatic front , meanwhile , opposition to Moammar Gadhafi continues to gain momentum . 
U.S. President Barack Obama reiterated Friday that he wants the Libyan leader to `` step down . '' 
He added that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' to decide whether to use military force , including helping enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits . '' 
Obama noted that NATO officials will meet Tuesday to consider whether to implement a no-fly zone . 
He said U.S. actions so far , including freezing assets and other sanctions , are `` slowly tightening the noose '' on Gadhafi . 
`` We have moved about as swiftly as an international coalition has ever moved to impose sanctions , '' he said . 
The U.S. Treasury Department beefed up those sanctions Friday , freezing the assets of nine more individuals . 
Among them are the wife and four sons of Libya 's leader , including Saadi , Hannibal , Muhammad and Saif Al-Arab Gadhafi . 
Libya 's defense minister , military intelligence director , external security organization head and public works coordinator are also included . 
Also Friday , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon introduced former Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib as his new special envoy to Libya . 
Khatib will leave New York over the weekend , accompanied by humanitarian and U.N. officials , to `` convey , in no uncertain terms , the concerns of the United Nations and the international community , '' Ban said . 
`` I -LRB- hope -RRB- that this effort ... will succeed in stopping the killings and ending the suffering of the civilian population , in addressing their humanitarian needs and in preserving the unity of the Libyan people and the territorial integrity of their homeland , '' Khatib said , adding that Gadhafi 's government `` welcomed '' the visit . 
In Brussels , Belgium , the European Council , a body of the European Union , issued a declaration saying Gadhafi `` must relinquish power immediately . '' 
`` His regime has lost all legitimacy and is no longer an interlocutor for the EU . 
The European Union has adopted restrictive measures against the country 's leadership and against entities holding sizeable assets controlled by the regime and stands ready to adopt further sanctions . 
`` The objective is for Libya to rapidly embark on an orderly transition to democracy through a broad-based dialogue . 
The European Union welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi which it considers a political interlocutor . '' 
Some members are clearer than others in their support for the National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in his news conference that `` we consider the National Council based in Benghazi as the proper interlocutors for Libya and they need to be recognized as such and encouraged . '' 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more cautious in her approach to the council and called them a possible interlocutor . 
Sarkozy said the European Council decision is a very strong one , and he stressed that a U.N. mandate and a request from the region are needed for intervention . 
`` We are considering and examining all necessary options to deal with the situation , '' he said . 
`` We can not stand by and watch this happen . '' 
He would n't say whether France or Britain would take unilateral military action if a U.N. mandate was n't achieved . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron said in Brussels that authorities are tightening `` the net '' on Gadhafi and `` his henchman '' with tougher financial sanctions . 
`` We have added the Libyan Central Bank and the Libyan Investment Authority to the Libyan EU asset freezing list and , in doing so , the UK has frozen a total of 12 billion pounds of Libyan assets , '' Cameron said . 
On Friday , the Libyan ambassador to the United States and to the United Nations will call on the United States to follow France 's lead and recognize the opposition as the legitimate representative of Libya . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has announced plans to meet with opposition leaders when she visits Tunisia and Egypt next week . 
She said the United States was suspending relations with the Libyan Embassy in Washington , and an administration official added that the embassy `` must shut down . '' 
Protests against the 68-year-old Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought his ouster after nearly 42 years of rule , and the discontent devolved into a fierce and bloody civil war . 
Death toll estimates earlier this week ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . 
As of Thursday morning , the war had forced out nearly 250,000 people , many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , the U.N. refugee agency said .

Ras Lanuf , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's ragtag rebels in Zawiya succumbed Thursday to better armed and organized government soldiers after enduring a week of attacks that left the coastal city strewn with the debris of war . 
The city 's main Martyrs ' Square was littered with the bombed-out , scorched carcasses of army tanks and other military vehicles . 
Workers were sweeping up the evidence as supporters of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi chanted slogans and waved green flags . 
`` Today Zawiya , tomorrow Benghazi , '' ITV News ' Bill Neely said a Gadhafi supporteer told him in a reference to Libya 's main rebel-held city in the east . 
Journalists beaten , tortured in Libya Neely said he was the first reporter to reach the city center Thursday after the government wrested its control from the rebels . 
He said doctors had told him that scores of civilians had been wounded or killed in the siege ; they called the onslaught a massacre , a war crime . 
He counted more than 20 freshly dug graves . 
The city itself was quiet ; shops were closed and houses appeared empty . 
The mosque 's minaret was demolished , and spent bullets and other munitions lay on the ground with bloodied mlitary clothing . 
State-run television broadcast video of weapons and ammunition reportedly left behind by the rebels , whom the reporter referred to as `` terrorists , dogs and traitors , '' Neely said . 
Government retaliation against the residents appears to have begun , said one man , who told ITV that government forces were carrying out house-to-house searches in Zawiya . 
`` They start to arrest people , normal people , '' he said . 
`` Some of them I know personally ; they have nothing to do with what 's happening . '' 
Battles also raged in and around the eastern city of Ras Lanuf and many other cities , with the regime using planes and heavy artillery in its effort to reclaim areas that had been taken by the opposition . 
Libya 's state TV reported that `` Ras Lanuf has been cleansed from the armed gangs connected to al Qaeda . '' 
A doctor who worked in Ras Lanuf said at least three people were killed and 30 wounded in fighting before the main hospital had to be evacuated . 
Doctors at a hospital in the city of al-Brega reported two deaths and more than 20 people wounded in fighting in Ras Lanuf . 
Opposition forces could be seen retreating from the city . 
Some fighters said they had pulled back to a checkpoint five miles east of the city , but it was not clear who was in control of the city . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman said the rebel forces appeared in disarray . 
`` It 's been a very chaotic effort on the part of the opposition fighters from the beginning , '' he said , adding that they had no command-and-control structure and little discipline . 
He credited them for their enthusiasm and spirit , but added , `` Once the going gets tough , the ranks start to fall apart and it descends into anarchy , chaos . '' 
Reporter : Libyan army fired at civilians Saif Gadhafi , a son of Moammar Gadhafi and a prominent spokesman for the regime , vowed to retake eastern Libya as well and insisted his father still commanded support . 
`` I receive hundreds of calls from the east daily and they are saying , ` Save us . ' 
They are begging us and pleading for us to save them and my answer is two words . 
Listen to me and I want those armed groups to listen to me real well , and I want our people in the east to hear this as well : We 're coming . '' 
He bristled at the possibility of military intervention . 
`` The Libyan people they will never welcome NATO or Americans , '' he said . 
`` Libya is not a piece of cake ; we are not a Mickey Mouse . '' 
Though the Libyan government forces appeared to advance on the ground , the opposition gained momentum internationally . 
The French government recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country and the British foreign secretary spoke to an opposition representative over the phone . 
In response , Libyan state TV said the Gadhafi government would consider ending its relationship with France . 
In the United States , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced plans to meet with opposition leaders . 
She said the United States was suspending relations with the Libyan Embassy in Washington , and an administration official added the embassy `` must shut down . '' 
But an official told CNN that `` ending the operations of the Libyan Embassy does not mean we 're cutting off diplomatic ties with Libya . '' 
Protests against the 68-year-old Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought his ouster after nearly 42 years of rule , and the discontent devolved into a fierce and bloody civil war . 
America 's top U.S. intelligence official , James Clapper , took note of Libya 's military prowess at a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting Thursday . 
He said Gadhafi is in the fight for the long haul , with military far superior to that of the opposition . 
Clapper described the Libyan air defense as `` substantial , '' saying it is the region 's second-largest , after Egypt , but he did not address how fighting would fare against Libya if a no-fly zone or other military strategies were imposed . 
He said Gadhafi has a lot of aircraft , although many are not operational . 
To `` some extent , '' he said , the aircraft have been used for attacks , but they have caused more structural damage than injury . 
In Brussels , Belgium , NATO defense ministers discussed the option of a no-fly zone over the North African country . 
Its secretary-general said any move to impose one would require a clear mandate from the United Nations . 
NATO also decided to bolster its presence in the Mediterranean Sea and perform detailed planning on humanitarian assistance . 
International military officials say the imposition of a no-fly zone could be complicated , but some opposition figures -- such as Mustafa Abdul-Jalil , a former justice minister who quit last month in protest and now heads the interim government in eastern Libya -- are advocating for the move . 
Gadhafi has said that imposing such a zone would simply unite Libyans behind him . 
Saying NATO is `` united , '' `` vigilant , '' and `` ready to act , '' Anders Fogh Rasmussen , the group 's secretary-general , said the body has begun round-the-clock airborne surveillance of Libya 's airspace . 
`` Time is of the essence , '' he said , adding that the crisis requires `` close international coordination '' among organizations such as NATO , the United Nations , the European Union , the African Union , and the Arab League . 
U.S. authorities have frozen $ 32 billion in assets tied to the Libyan regime , White House spokesman Jay Carney said . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke by telephone with Mahmoud Jabril , the National Transitional Council 's special envoy . 
He said European foreign ministers on Thursday talked about how the EU should react `` to the continuing appalling and unacceptable actions '' of the regime . 
Hague `` made clear that planning was under way on a full range of responses , including the possible establishment of a no-fly zone , '' the Foreign Office said in a statement . 
`` It would need international support , a clear trigger and a legal basis . 
He also said that another diplomatic mission would be sent to Benghazi shortly . '' 
At the NATO meeting , U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said a no-fly zone option was still being considered , but was only in the planning stages . 
Gates added that any military response to Libya would need the United Nations to sanction it . 
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed an executive order banning the sale to Libya of arms , ammunition and military equipment , according to the Kremlin 's website . 
The Council of the European Union Thursday announced it will extend restrictions against Libyan entities . 
As for Gadhafi 's government , it has sought to influence international sentiment , announcing that its secretary of state for international relations will travel to Portugal , Greece and Malta on an exploratory , fact-finding mission that may include other destinations . 
The country has also invited British , French , Dutch and German fact-finding teams to examine reports of aerial bombardment and massacres . 
None has taken up Gadhafi on the offer . 
Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . 
As of Thursday morning , the war had forced out nearly 250,000 people , many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , the U.N. refugee agency said . 
The United States will soon send disaster relief teams into eastern Libya , White House National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said . 
He said the teams ' activities should not be viewed as military operations . 
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay on Thursday condemned the detention and possible torture by Libyan authorities of a BBC news team working to cover the conflict in Zawiya . 
The journalists , released from detention in Libya Wednesday , told of beatings and mock executions . 
The Guardian , a British daily newspaper , reported that one of its correspondents , Ghaith Abdul-Ahad , was missing . 
He was traveling with Andrei Netto of the Brazilian newspaper Estado , who was detained by authorities while reporting from Libya , the Guardian said . 
Netto was released Thursday and was to leave the country Friday .

2011-03-11,"By the CNN Wire Staff Gadhafi likely to survive revolt ? 
NEW : U.S. ambassador spoke with rebel military chief Intelligence chief warns Gadhafi has the upper hand Read a day-by-day account of the battle for control of key areas of Libya . 
And for the latest on what 's next for Libya , the opposition and Moammar Gadhafi , tune in to '' AC360 '' at 10 p.m. ET Thursday on CNN . 
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States plans to send `` purely humanitarian '' disaster relief teams into eastern Libya , where rebels battling longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi may be losing ground in that country 's civil war , top U.S. officials said Thursday . 
White House National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon told reporters that the U.S. Agency for International Development teams will be sent into monitor the delivery of humanitarian aid and should not be viewed as a military operation . 
`` It can in no way shape or form be seen as military intervention , '' Donilon said . 
The teams will assess that humanitarian aid is being delivered , he said , adding , `` This is purely humanitarian to better assist in a humanitarian way the people of Libya . '' 
Donilon 's announcement came as officials in Washington , Europe and the Middle East are debating whether to aid rebel forces , who have been battling to topple Gadhafi since mid-February . 
But in a blunt assessment to Congress , National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Gadhafi 's advantage in military force makes him likely to survive the revolt . 
Are Libyan rebels losing momentum ? 
Clinton : Libya will be held accountable NATO awaits U.N. mandate on Libya McCain talks possible Libyan no-fly zone Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the rebels are `` in for a tough row '' against Gadhafi , who still commands warplanes , an air-defense network and loyal army brigades against the opposition forces . 
He cautioned that the situation is `` very fluid , '' but added , `` I think , longer term , the regime will prevail . '' 
`` I do believe Gadhafi is in this for the long haul , '' Clapper said . 
`` I do n't think he has any intention , despite some of the press speculation to the contrary , of leaving . 
From all evidence that we have -- which I 'd be prepared to discuss in closed session -- he appears to be hunkering down for the duration . '' 
The comment led to a call for Clapper 's firing by a member of the committee , South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham . 
In a statement issued after the hearing , Graham said the remarks were `` not helpful to our national security interests . '' 
But Clapper 's assessment was backed up by Lt. Gen. Ronald Burgess , the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency . 
Burgess told senators that Gadhafi `` seems to have staying power , unless some other dynamic changes at this time . '' 
At NATO headquarters in Belgium , meanwhile , Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Thursday the allies are moving to beef up their naval presence off Libya to provide better surveillance and have discussed `` initial options '' for imposing a no-fly zone over the country in the event the U.N. Security Council approves one . 
But Clapper warned that the Libyan network of radar and anti-aircraft batteries is `` quite substantial , '' though some of the equipment has fallen into rebel hands . 
Libyan forces also have a large number of shoulder-fired missiles , `` And , of course , there 's great concern there about them falling into the wrong hands . '' 
The Obama administration has called on Gadhafi , who took power in a 1969 coup , to step down . 
France recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country on Thursday . 
And Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a House committee that Washington is `` suspending '' its ties to the Libyan Embassy and reaching out to opposition leaders `` inside and outside of Libya . '' 
The move effectively orders the embassy to close , though it stops short of breaking U.S.-Libyan diplomatic relations , a senior administration official told CNN . 
`` This is recognition that Gadhafi is no longer the legitimate leader of Libya , and therefore his representatives should leave , '' said the official , who was not authorized to speak on the record . 
Libyan Ambassador Ali Aujali abandoned Gadhafi last month , and the United States has not recognized his replacement , the official said . 
Aujali met Thursday with Clinton , telling reporters afterward that they discussed whether the United States should recognize the Libyan rebels -- a move he said would `` give us room to move , and to act , and to explain our views and to be received by different countries and different officials . '' 
U.S. recognition is `` very , very important , '' he said adding that Washington `` needs `` to stop Gadhafi and his family from killing our people . '' 
Clinton plans to meet with some of those figures during a visit to Tunisia and Egypt next week , she told the House Appropriations Committee . 
And at the White House , spokesman Jay Carney said the United Strates is still assessing opposition group `` to find out what their vision is , who they represent , what their ideas are and where they would take Libya in a post-Gadhafi future . '' 
The U.S. Ambassador to Libya , Gene Cretz , apparently spoke to the head of the opposition 's military council sometime after the revolt began , according to a recorded conversation played on Libyan state television Thursday . 
An opposition spokesman , Khaled Alsayeh , told CNN the call was intended to lay the groundwork for future communications , but the caller -- identified as Gen. Omar Hariri -- hung up before Cretz asked what equipment or support the rebels needed . 
A U.S. official , who would not talk on the record because of the sensitivity of the issue , confirmed the authenticity of the call to CNN , but there was no indication when it was recorded . 
The State Department shuttered its embassy in Tripoli and evacuated U.S. diplomats in late February .

2011-03-11,"By Pam Benson , CNN National Security Producer Gadhafi likely to survive revolt ? 
NEW : Spokeswoman says Clapper is standing by his comments on Libya NEW : National security adviser : Clapper was giving a `` flat-out resources analysis '' In testimony , he said Libyan regime would `` prevail '' over rebels , prompting criticism His statement that China , Russia pose greatest threat to U.S. irks Sen. Carl Levin Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A spokeswoman for James Clapper said the embattled director of national intelligence stands by remarks he made Thursday `` about the current military situation in Libya '' that prompted a leading Republican senator to call for his resignation . 
The Obama administration also said Clapper still has its `` full faith and confidence . '' 
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , issued a statement criticizing Clapper 's testimony , made during a committee hearing earlier in the day , that Moammar Gadhafi 's regime would `` prevail '' over rebels seeking to oust the 68-year-old dictator from power in Libya . 
`` His comments will make the situation more difficult for those opposing Gadhafi , '' said Graham , adding they undercut U.S. efforts and should not have been made in a public forum . 
Graham cited two previous occasions in which Clapper made misstatements , and said his comments on the Libya situation `` should be the final straw . '' 
Jamie Smith , director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , said that Clapper 's testimony `` provided a snapshot of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the regime and the opposition . 
As he stated in his testimony , the situation in Libya is very fluid . '' 
`` Many factors will come into play over time including the pressure being brought to bear by the international community as well as the Libyan people 's clear desire for change , '' Smith said . 
`` As this dynamic situation evolves , the Intelligence Community will continue to provide its best assessment of the current situation as well as identify opportunities that project into the future . '' 
Clapper 's comment on Libya was not the only one that got him in trouble with some members of the armed services committee . 
In an exchange with Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan and Joe Manchin of West Virginia over what nation posed the greatest threat to the United States , the director focused his responses on the chief nuclear rivals , China and Russia , rather than on the regimes in North Korea and Iran , which are openly belligerent . 
Clapper went on to clarify his answer , to which Levin gave lukewarm acceptance , but later Thursday , Senate Intelligence Chairman Dianne Feinstein , D-California , called the director 's response on the threat issue `` a problem '' and , when asked by CNN , pointedly declined to say she had confidence in him . 
`` On the question on the two nations with the greatest intent to harm ours , I do not believe they 're China and Russia , '' said Feinstein , who was not at the hearing . 
`` I do n't understand why that was put out there . 
So , that 's a problem . '' 
Asked whether Clapper has problems communicating , Feinstein responded , `` I do n't know what it is and I 'm not going to speculate , but clearly there 's a problem ... I would like the opportunity to look more deeply into it , OK ? '' 
Other senators , including John McCain , R-Arizona , and Joseph Lieberman , a Connecticut independent who caucuses with Democrats , expressed support for Clapper . 
McCain said the director was `` doing a very fine job . '' 
White House press secretary Jay Carney defended Clapper and said his words were misinterpreted . 
`` If you look closely at the transcript of what Director Clapper said , he was answering a question with regard to military capacity , '' Carney said . 
`` Obviously , Russia and China are two of the three largest nuclear powers in the world , therefore they have dangerous weapons and they have the capacity , but he made clear that we do not view Russia and China as a threat . '' 
And in a follow-up answer regarding Clapper 's Libya statement , Carney said Graham 's response `` was based on a real misinterpretation of what Director Clapper said today . '' 
Asked if the president still had confidence in Clapper , Carney said , `` Yes , full faith and confidence . '' 
In a conference-call phone briefing Thursday night , National Security Adviser Tom Donilon said he believed Clapper `` was presenting a kind of a flat-out resources analysis '' of the situation in Libya . 
`` He went through the kind of equipment and resources that the regime has . '' 
`` And I think if you look at it , he said from a standpoint of attrition , if you do an attrition analysis , you get to his conclusion . '' 
In the same conference call , Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes addressed the issue of specific adversary nations , saying the issue is `` a matter of capability -LRB- in the case of China and Russia -RRB- versus intent '' to be a U.S. adversary `` that leads you to focus on nations such as North Korea , organizations such as al Qaeda , who again are a great focus of what we do here every day . '' 
That seemed to be the thrust of Clapper 's protracted exchange on Thursday after Manchin asked Clapper what nations he thought posed the greatest threat to the United States . 
Clapper said Russia and China posed a mortal threat , citing their nuclear arsenals and military capabilities . 
But he added that he did n't think either nation had the intent to strike the United States . 
That clearly was not the answer Levin expected . . 
`` You did n't mention Iran or North Korea , which would have been the first two countries I would have thought of in response to that question , '' the committee chairman . 
`` I was really kind of taken aback almost by your answer . '' 
Clapper explained that he interpreted the question to be what countries pose a `` mortal threat '' to the United States . 
`` Iran and North Korea are , you know of great concern . 
I do n't know at this point in time they pose a direct mortal threat to the continental United States , '' he said . 
Levin pressed Clapper on whether Russia and China were a direct mortal threat to the United States , and Clapper reiterated that they both had the capability , but it was unlikely they had the intent . 
Levin then flipped the question : `` By that measure we represent the direct mortal threat to both of them , right ? '' 
Clapper seemed to avoid a direct answer but eventually answered yes . 
Manchin stepped in to to see if he could clarify Clapper 's position by asking which nation has the intent to be the greatest adversary . 
Clapper answered , `` Probably China , '' which once again set Levin off . 
`` I 'm just as surprised by that answer as I was by your first answer , '' Levin said . 
Clapper tried to explain that he was `` loath '' to pick one country and restated that both China and Russia have the capability , but he did n't think either had the intent . 
Levin suggested Clapper needs to be more careful with his words . 
`` When the Director of National Intelligence talks about what are the greatest threats , unless he starts with capabilities , and uses that , and does n't just answer ` China and Russia ' the way he did -- I was concerned by the answer . '' 
After the hearing , Levin issued a statement saying , `` I was taken aback by Director Clapper 's statement about China and Russia and , frankly , I was surprised by how long it took him to correct the impression that he created . 
He did finally correct it , however , and I am glad that he did , and I am satisfied with his correction . '' 
This is n't the first time Clapper has had to explain comments he has made . 
He was called on the carpet last month for referring to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as a secular organization at another Congressional hearing . 
And during an interview with ABC News in December 2010 , Clapper appeared unaware of a terrorist plot that had been interrupted in Britain earlier in the day . 
In both cases , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence put out statements on Clapper 's behalf . 
In the instance of the ABC News interview , the office said the director had not been briefed on the UK terror plot . 
"
2011-03-11,"President Barack Obama said Friday that all options for responding to the crisis in Libya remain on the table , but he added that any military option means that `` you 've got to balance costs versus benefits , and I do n't take that decision lightly . '' 
Obama told reporters the desired outcome would be for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to `` step down '' in the wake of civil war that has erupted in the North African country and Gadhafi 's military attacks on his own people . 
His comments followed a call by European Union leaders earlier Friday for Gadhafi to `` relinquish power immediately , '' and France 's embrace of the Libyan opposition leadership . 
The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday added nine more Libyans , including Gadhafi 's wife and several more of his children , to a list that freezes their assets in the United States and restricts their dealings with U.S. entities . 
Gadhafi and some of his other sons already were on the list . 
At a White House news conference , Obama outlined steps the United States has taken so far to pressure Gadhafi to step down , including the previously announced sanctions as well as talks with NATO allies on the possibility of establishing a no-fly zone over Libya . 
He noted that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would meet with Libyan opposition figures in coming days during a trip to Egypt and Tunisia , and that his government has assigned `` a representative whose specific job is to interact with the opposition and determine ways that we can further help them . '' 
However , Libya 's former U.S. ambassador , who resigned last month in protest of Gadhafi 's violence against protesters , called Friday for the United States to recognize the newly created opposition National Transitional Council he now represents . 
`` We want recognition from all the rest of the world for this council , '' Ali Aujali told Libyan-American supporters and reporters . 
The French government on Thursday recognized the opposition council as the sole representative of the country , and the British foreign secretary spoke to an opposition representative over the phone . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more cautious , calling the Libyan council a possible interlocutor . 
Clinton told a House committee Thursday that Washington was `` suspending '' its ties to the Libyan Embassy and reaching out to opposition leaders `` inside and outside of Libya . '' 
The move effectively orders the embassy to close , though it stops short of breaking U.S.-Libyan diplomatic relations , a senior administration official told CNN . 
Aujali abandoned Gadhafi last month , and the United States has not recognized his replacement , the official said . 
Obama has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats for not ordering a no-fly zone over Libya or other steps intended to prevent Gadhafi from using military force against his own people . 
Both Obama and Clinton have said any U.S. military involvement must be part of an international effort , preferably sanctioned by the United Nations and Arab governments . 
Obama said Friday that NATO officials will meet next week to consider creating a no-fly zone over Libya . 
On Thursday , White House National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said the U.S. government planned to send `` purely humanitarian '' disaster relief teams into eastern Libya , where rebels battling Gadhafi were losing ground . 
The U.S. Agency for International Development teams will be sent into monitor the delivery of humanitarian aid and should not be viewed as a military operation , he said .

2011-03-11,"BEIRUT | Fri Mar 11 , 2011 8:08 am EST BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels trying to topple Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi have so far fought alone . 
Help is not in sight , even as he strikes back with tanks , artillery and warplanes . 
Gaddafi is widely reviled in the Arab world , even by his fellow autocrats . 
Nor is he loved by the Western powers that had courted him for his oil until the revolt against him . 
Yet with the military momentum appearing to shift in his favor , the Libyan leader of 41 years may succeed where Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak and Tunisia 's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali failed , in clinging to power . 
His willingness to use extreme force , with no effective riposte from the outside world , could also set a dangerous example to other Arab rulers confronting disaffected populations . 
According to a somber assessment by U.S. President Barack Obama 's national intelligence chief , James Clapper , Gaddafi is `` in this for the long haul '' and is likely to prevail . 
Public calls are growing for some action to save rebels and civilians from the firepower of pro-Gaddafi forces , now regaining ground near Tripoli and along the eastern coast . 
Yet nothing has been done beyond sanctions in the form of an asset freeze and arms embargo , threatening prosecution for war crimes , and French-led moves to recognize a rebel national council . 
The rag-tag Libyan fighters battling Gaddafi 's military can not fathom what the world is waiting for , even as the leader 's son Saif al-Islam declares that they face a full-scale assault to crush their three-week-old uprising . 
`` I am disappointed as we have asked for air and sea blockades , '' Mustafa Abdel-Jalil , head of the opposition national council in Libya , told the BBC on Friday , saying that delaying action further `` might allow Gaddafi to regain control and remain in power against the will of the Libyan people . '' 
Yet there is no international consensus on robust action . 
Judging by Thursday 's meetings of the Gulf Cooperation Council -LRB- GCC -RRB- , the African Union and NATO , none will emerge soon . 
European Union leaders were meeting on Friday to discuss Libya . 
Many fear mission creep if , say , a no-fly zone were imposed . 
`` What happens if it is not the Libyan air force that is gaining ground , but their armor ... and heavy artillery ? '' 
asked Timur Goksel , a former U.N. peacekeeping adviser in Beirut . 
`` Then what do you do , attack those ? 
Because that 's not a no-fly zone , it 's war . 
It 's a very complicated decision . 
The Western countries have to think very hard , '' Goksel said . 
For all their anti-Gaddafi rhetoric , Western powers are wary of plunging into another conflict in a Muslim nation in the absence of any simple way to remove a leader bent on survival . 
The United States is hamstrung by its costly and contentious military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Russia and China , along with Arab nations such as Algeria and Syria , are queasy about any precedent for meddling in another country 's affairs . 
So it is hard to get the U.N. Security Council to authorize military action -- no-fly zones or sending military advisers or weapons to rebels are arguably acts of war -- and no nation or alliance is yet ready to step in without such approval . 
The International Crisis Group has argued instead for a ceasefire and negotiations to end a burgeoning Libyan civil war . 
`` Western calls for military intervention of one kind or another are perilous and potentially counter-productive . 
There are no quick or easy fixes , '' the conflict resolution group says . 
`` Insisting that Gaddafi step down will not make it happen . 
Imposing a no-fly zone , bombing airfields or arming the rebels could tilt the balance of power in the rebels ' favor , but is unlikely to swiftly bring down the regime . '' 
The African Union , rejecting any military intervention , plans to send five heads of state to Libya to seek a truce . 
The Arab League has suspended Libya 's membership . 
Saudi Arabia and its five partners in the GCC have voiced support for a no-fly zone and declared Gaddafi 's rule illegitimate . 
The Arab League was due to meet in Cairo on Saturday and officials said it would not let a delegation from Tripoli attend . 
But decisive action from the League would be a surprise . 
`` The Arab League has become an entirely emasculated body that is essentially capable of doing nothing except rhetoric and speeches , '' said Karim Makdisi , who teaches international relations at the American University of Beirut -LRB- AUB -RRB- . 
He said most Arab regimes remained intact despite the overthrow of leaders in Egypt and Tunisia and popular unrest against others . 
None of them wanted the Arab League to lead the way in intervening against the government of a member state . 
NATO is also skittish about proposals to crimp Gaddafi 's military with a no-fly zone . 
This would require evidence of war crimes against civilians , a clear legal basis and firm regional support , said its secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasumussen . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has signaled that her country will not go solo in imposing a no-fly zone on Libya . 
`` Absent international authorization , the United States acting alone would be stepping into a situation whose consequences are unforeseeable , '' she said on Thursday , belittling the effect of past no-fly zones in Iraq and Serbia . 
Gaddafi , like Iraq 's Saddam Hussein , would portray any Western intervention as a selfish , colonial venture -- rhetoric that for many Arabs is grounded in decades of bitter reality . 
`` What we fear most is this European and Western eagerness to take control of Libya 's oil , '' said Omar Nashabe , an editor at Beirut 's al-Akhbar newspaper , which is sympathetic to Hezbollah . 
Many Arabs feel outraged by Gaddafi 's bloody strikes against his foes , but might also mistrust Western action , especially if an air embargo produced unintended civilian casualties . 
`` There is no belief that U.S. intervention will be brief , in the interests of Arabs , or serve the interests of stability , '' said AUB 's Makdisi . 
Many Arabs would see it as oil-motivated or as a U.S. bid to get ahead of the curve after failing to respond adequately to the pro-democracy revolts in Egypt and Tunisia . 
`` The wider context is the abysmal failure of the Obama administration to have any coherent U.S. policy toward the Middle East , '' Makdisi said , citing its past support for Arab strongmen and its ill-starred Israeli-Palestinian peace drive .

2011-03-11,"UPDATE 3-Dutch marines freed by Libya flown out to Greece \* Marines arrive in Athens on Greek military plane \* To return to the Netherlands shortly -LRB- Updates with quote from Dutch prime minister -RRB- ATHENS , March 11 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Three Dutch marines detained in civil war-hit Libya were released and flown to Athens aboard a Greek military plane on Friday . 
They were met at Athens airport by Dutch government officials , including Deputy Foreign Minister Ed Kronenberg who headed the delegation that negotiated their release . 
`` The people have been very well taken care off , they are in good health and in good shape , '' Kronenberg told reporters . 
`` They will be flying back to the Netherlands very soon . '' 
The marines were arrested on Feb. 27 at Sirte on Libya 's central Mediterranean coast when they tried to rescue a Dutch engineer and another European by helicopter . 
The Dutch Defense Ministry confirmed the operation was carried out without authorisation from Libya , whose soldiers prevented the helicopter from taking off . 
The civilians were later handed over to the Dutch embassy in Tripoli and returned to the Netherlands on March 2 . 
`` Obviously we are overjoyed that this has happened . 
We were very worried about the situation . 
Last night it transpired that they would be out of Libya , which happened at the end of the morning , at the end of the night , '' Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters in Brussels . 
The three marines will return to the Netherlands soon but probably not on Friday to give them time to recover from their detention , Defense Minister Hans Hillen was quoted as saying by public broadcaster NOS. . 
The marines ' release was announced on Thursday by the son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , Saif al-Islam . 
`` We told them , do n't come back again without our permission . 
We captured the first NATO soldiers , we are sending them back home . 
But we are still keeping their helicopter , '' he told Reuters . 
Tens of thousands of foreigners living and working in Libya have left the country since a rebellion against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule broke out last month .

2011-03-12,"The Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone in Libya and is asking that the U.N. Security Council impose the measure , officials of the regional body told reporters . 
`` It has one goal : To protect the civilian population , '' Amre Moussa , the body 's secretary-general said . 
`` We will inform the U.N. Security Council of our request to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya , '' Moussa said . 
`` The U.N. Security Council should decide how it will be enforced . '' 
Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah , Oman 's foreign minister who joined Moussa to answer questions , said the no-fly zone would be a preventive measure and would have to be stopped immediately when the Libyan crisis ends . 
He said Arab League members have reservations about military intervention , but said all countries agreed that a no-fly zone must be imposed urgently to protect civilians . 
`` We hope the Libyan authorities will respect a no-fly decision , '' he said . 
`` Be assured the Arab countries will not accept the intervention of the NATO coalition . '' 
Moussa said the league also voted to open channels of communication with the Transitional National Council , the Libyan opposition 's newly formed administration , and that any talks with that body would be on a humanitarian basis . 
`` We are giving them legitimacy but we 're not giving them political recognition , '' Moussa said . 
`` We are prepared to help evacuate any Arab nationals from Libya regardless of their nationality . '' 
The Arab League also called for immediate humanitarian assistance and an end to the bloodshed in Libya , where civil war has broken out between forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement . 
The White House cheered the League 's announcements and stressed it will continue to pressure Gadhafi , support the opposition and prepare for `` all contingencies . '' 
`` We welcome this important step by the Arab League , which strengthens the international pressure on Gadhafi and support for the Libyan people , '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement about the Arab League 's no-fly vote . 
Opposition forces made strides in the early days of the rebellion , but Gadhafi 's military has recently gained strong momentum . 
The military has been pounding the key oil port of Ras Lanuf , once in the hands of rebel forces , and has taken control of towns such as nearby Bin Jawad . 
The Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure .

The Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure . 
The League was meeting at its headquarters in Cairo , while hundreds of demonstrators outside urged the international community to step up support for Libyan opposition groups . 
Pleading for international help as they continue to lose ground topro-Gadhafi forces , rebels are asking for a no-fly zone that would theoretically thwart airstrikes . 
No-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly . 
Such zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . 
Western powers have said any action by the international community , including a no-fly zone , would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations . 
U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' on whether to use military force , including helping to enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits . '' 
While France has recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people , the European Union was more restrained Friday , saying it `` welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi , which it considers a political interlocutor . '' 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was even more cautious in her approach to the council , calling it a possible interlocutor . 
Britain 's Foreign Office issued a statement after Saturday 's vote , saying , `` We welcome the Arab League 's decision to make contact with the Interim National Council , '' which the government sees as `` valid interlocutors . '' 
The statement also said that no-fly zones are `` one option being considered as part of international contingency planning to respond quickly to events on the ground as they develop . 
This planning does not pre-judge any particular outcome . '' 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a news conference in Brussels , Belgium , Friday that `` we consider the National Council based in Benghazi as the proper interlocutors for Libya and they need to be recognized as such and encouraged . '' 
In another diplomatic development , the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Libya , Rashid Khalikov , arrived in Tripoli on Saturday to discuss access for humanitarian aid . 
`` The international aid community has expressed concerns over the very limited access to various areas in Libya , including those places where heavy fighting is taking place , '' Khalikov said . 
About 260,000 people , mostly third-country nationals , have left Libya for neighboring countries , primarily Tunisia and Egypt . 
In response to the crisis , the United Nations and its partners launched a `` flash appeal '' seeking $ 160 million `` to assist both those leaving the country and those expected to need humanitarian assistance inside Libya , '' the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said . 
Meanwhile , the Libyan government on Saturday took journalists to the eastern city of Bin Jawad , where the government ousted rebels about a week ago . 
CNN 's Nic Robertson said he saw fighter jets in the sky but he did n't see them engage in strikes . 
He saw some structural damage , such as a blown-out police station and damage to a school and houses , including a Katyusha rocket embedded in the wall of a house . 
Some stores were closed and others had been looted .

The military has been pounding the key oil port of Ras Lanuf , once in the hands of rebel forces , and has taken control of towns such as nearby Bin Jawad . 
The Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure . 
Libya 's National Oil Corporation , meanwhile , urged companies to resume oil exports after saying that all ports are safe , state TV reported . 
Also Sunday , the Maryland-based SITE Intelligence Group released a video in which it says Abu Yahya al-Libi , an al Qaeda leader , calls on Libyans to take up arms against Gadhafi . 
The Libyan leader has frequently accused al Qaeda of being behind the unrest that began last month and has since spiraled into a civil war . 
The Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone `` to protect the civilian population '' in Libya , the body 's secretary-general Amre Moussa said . 
`` We will inform the U.N. Security Council of our request to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya , '' Moussa said . 
`` The U.N. Security Council should decide how it will be enforced . '' 
The Libyan foreign ministry denounced the League 's move , calling it a `` flagrant action against its charter , '' according to state TV Sunday . 
It also reported that the ministry would welcome the arrival of a fact-finding mission sent by some African nations . 
Also Saturday , an Al-Jazeera cameraman was killed in an apparent ambush near Benghazi , Libya , becoming the first journalist killed in the country since the start of the civil war , the network reported . 
Ali Hassan al Jaber was returning to Benghazi , an opposition stronghold in the east , from a nearby town where he had reported on an opposition protest when `` unknown fighters opened fire on a car he and his colleagues were traveling in , '' Al-Jazeera reported on its English-language website . 
The cameraman and another person were wounded . 
Al Jaber was rushed to a hospital , but did not survive , the network said . 
`` Al-Jazeera condemns the cowardly crime , which comes as part of the Libyan regime 's malicious campaign targeting Al-Jazeera and its staff , '' the network reported . 
The no-fly zone which the Arab League is calling for would be a preventive measure and would have to be stopped immediately when the Libyan crisis ends , Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah , Oman 's foreign minister said in a joint appearance with Moussa . 
Arab League members have reservations about military intervention , but said all countries agreed that a no-fly zone must be imposed urgently to protect civilians , bin Abdullah said . 
`` We hope the Libyan authorities will respect a no-fly decision , '' he said . 
`` Be assured the Arab countries will not accept the intervention of the NATO coalition . '' 
Moussa said the league also voted to open channels of communication with the Transitional National Council , the Libyan opposition 's newly formed administration , and that any talks with that body would be on a humanitarian basis . 
`` We are giving them legitimacy but we 're not giving them political recognition , '' Moussa said . 
`` We are prepared to help evacuate any Arab nationals from Libya regardless of their nationality . '' 
The Arab League also called for immediate humanitarian assistance and an end to the bloodshed in Libya , where war has broken out between forces loyal to Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement . 
The White House cheered the League 's announcements and stressed it will continue to pressure Gadhafi , support the opposition and prepare for `` all contingencies . '' 
Opposition forces made strides in the early days of the rebellion , but Gadhafi 's military has recently gained strong momentum . 
The League was meeting at its headquarters in Cairo , while hundreds of demonstrators outside urged the international community to step up support for Libyan opposition groups . 
Pleading for international help as they continue to lose ground to pro-Gadhafi forces , rebels are asking for a no-fly zone that would theoretically thwart airstrikes . 
No-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly . 
Such zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . 
Western powers have said any action by the international community , including a no-fly zone , would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations . 
U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' on whether to use military force , including helping to enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits . '' 
While France has recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people , the European Union was more restrained Friday , saying it `` welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi , which it considers a political interlocutor . '' 
The Libyan government on Saturday took journalists to the eastern city of Bin Jawad , where the government ousted rebels about a week ago . 
CNN 's Nic Robertson said he saw fighter jets in the sky but he did n't see them engage in strikes . 
He saw some structural damage , such as a blown-out police station and damage to a school and houses , including a Katyusha rocket embedded in the wall of a house . 
Some stores were closed and others had been looted .

2011-03-15,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan rebels ask : Where is no-fly zone ? 
NEW : Lebanon U.N. representative introduces no-fly zone resolution Clinton says the U.S. is in talks with the Arab League on a proposal Libya state TV says Gadhafi forces retook Ajdabiya , opposition disputes claim . 
Pro-Gadhafi troops say they are in control of Zuwara -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The key Libyan city of Ajdabiya , the last major point between pro-government forces and the opposition stronghold of Benghazi , was slipping from the opposition 's hands Tuesday , witnesses reported . 
Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi fired artillery into Ajdabiya , and there were eyewitness reports of at least two airstrikes on the city . 
If Ajdabiya is retaken by pro-Gadhafi forces , it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition 's base . 
Opposition fighters in Ajdabiya returned fire with anti-aircraft weapons and rocket-propelled grenades , but eventually had to pull back their defense positions . 
Gadhafi 's forces approached the city from the south and the west , witnesses said . 
Libyan state television reported Tuesday evening that `` Ajdabiya has been cleansed from mercenaries and terrorists connected to al Qaeda . '' 
Inside a Libyan rebel training camp Appearing to contradict that report , Khaled al-Sayeh , a spokesman for the opposition military forces , said Gadhafi 's forces had reached the western outskirts of Ajdabiya . 
The spokesman said a small unit of government forces had entered the city Tuesday but were repelled by opposition fighters . 
Sayeh said opposition forces deployed planes and naval assets to strike at the advancing Gadhafi battalion and capture an oil tanker registered to `` Hannibal Gadhafi . '' 
The tanker was carrying 25,000 tons of fuel . 
Sayeh said the opposition also attacked three oil tankers that Gadhafi had converted into battleships and sank two of them . 
However , the spokesman said the opposition 's ability to mount an air defensive was limited and said the imposition of a no-fly zone was paramount . 
Without implementation of a no-fly zone , rebels fear that it is only a matter of time before there is a bloodbath in Benghazi . 
Lebanon 's U.N. representative distributed a draft resolution Tuesday calling for the imposition of a no-fly zone on Libya to members of the U.N. Security Council . 
The council is scheduled to take up the matter Wednesday morning . 
Meanwhile , pro-Gadhafi forces wrested control of the town of Zuwara from rebels , an opposition spokesman and a witness said . 
Pro-Gadhafi forces with tanks and heavy artillery forcibly entered Zuwara on Monday , clashing with rebels for several hours before subduing the town , the sources said . 
Troops entered the town about 9 p.m. and began shooting randomly into buildings , the opposition spokesman said , declining to be named for his safety . 
He is in Zuwara . 
Tuesday morning troops announced they were in control , the spokesman said . 
The town was relatively quiet Tuesday , with locals afraid to leave their homes , he and the witness said . 
Gadhafi is fighting to regain his dominance over the entire country after some towns and cities came under control of the armed opposition . 
Zuwara is west of the capital , Tripoli , which Gadhafi controls . 
The rebels ' stronghold of Benghazi is to the east of Tripoli . 
Rebels had appeared Monday to have slowed the eastward advance of government forces toward Benghazi at the town of al-Brega . 
But it was not clear late in the day who controlled al-Brega , which contains a large oil refinery and natural gas plant , said CNN 's Ben Wedeman , reporting from Benghazi , which is about two hours further east . 
For the first time since violence erupted last month , forces opposed to Gadhafi did not allow members of the news media to go forward . 
They expressed concern that coverage from the rebel side of the lines could provide intelligence to government forces about the ragtag rebel forces ' tactics , or lack thereof . 
Life in Benghazi appeared calm on the surface Monday . 
Stores were open , and people went about their business . 
But some residents expressed an underlying fear that Gadhafi appeared to have gained the upper hand and was advancing his military forward as much of the rest of the world focused on the catastrophe in Japan . 
Some expressed fear that Gadhafi may seek to block roads leading to Benghazi and other coastal cities , then lay siege to them . 
Some worried that , if Gadhafi reasserts control of those cities in eastern Libya that led the revolt against his rule , he might carry out bloody reprisals . 
Forces loyal to Gadhafi have been fighting to recapture towns from the rebels since the uprising began last month . 
En route to Washington after a weekend trip to Bahrain , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday that the logistical challenges of enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya could be overcome . 
`` If we are directed to impose a no-fly zone , we have the resources to do it , '' he said . 
`` The question is whether it 's a wise thing to do . 
And that 's the discussion that 's going at a political level . '' 
However , the chances that the U.N. Security Council will adopt a no-fly zone are in doubt because of resistance from some council members . 
The Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone over Libya to protect the civilian population . 
The Libyan Foreign Ministry has denounced the league 's move , calling it a `` flagrant action against its charter . '' 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that the United States is consulting with the Arab League regarding goals tied to the establishment of a no-fly zone . 
`` We understand the urgency of this '' and are exploring new ways to help opponents of Gadhafi , Clinton said during a visit to Egypt . 
But ultimately there must be support in the U.N. Security Council for any international action , she said .

2011-03-15,"Health care is one of the greatest concerns , official says Hundreds of thousands are seeking refuge along borders Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the debate continues over whether the U.S. should involve itself directly in the upheaval in Libya , millions of dollars of American aid is arriving there already . 
Safety concerns mean U.S. disaster experts have been unable to enter Libya to see first-hand the dimensions of the humanitarian crisis , State Department officials said Monday , but U.S. partners are dispensing assistance . 
Most of that aid is moving to the eastern part of the country , controlled by rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
Nancy Lindborg , assistant administrator of the United States Agency for International Development , said the U.S. is working with the United Nations and private organizations to provide urgently needed supplies inside Libya . 
`` One of the greatest concerns inside Libya is , first of all , health needs , both urgent and just the regular primary health care needs , and ongoing food security challenges , which is why the emphasis for work inside Libya has been on the health and on food security needs , '' Lindborg said at the State Department . 
Inside a Libyan rebel training camp Included in the U.S. supplies are two emergency health kits , which provide primary health care supplies for 10,000 people for three months , Lindborg said . 
`` I want to underscore that we are already and have been for some time now providing assistance directly inside of Libya , '' Lindborg said . 
She and Eric Schwartz , assistant secretary of state for population , refugees and migration , just returned from the Libyan border with Tunisia , where thousands have sought refuge from the political upheaval . 
An estimated 140,000 people remain in Tunisia , and more than 110,000 are on the Egyptian side of the border . 
The U.S. has provided $ 21 million for assistance both inside Libya and to refugees along its border . 
The U.S. says that despite lack of direct American supervision , the aid is reaching people in need . 
`` I think we can say with a high degree of confidence that the assistance that has gone in is going to good use , '' Schwartz said . 
`` The international and non-governmental organizations with which we work , we have worked with for many , many years . 
They have established very careful protocols for the distribution of assistance , even in highly uncertain and fragile environments . ''

2011-03-15,"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -LRB- pictured March 8 -RRB- said military invention by the U.S. and Europe in Libya would make matters worse . 
But Ahmadinejad said he condemns `` massacres '' in Libya Madrid , Spain -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States and Europe should not intervene militarily in strife-torn Libya because it would make matters worse , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told Spanish state television TVE on Tuesday . 
`` I think a military intervention would be even worse . 
The experience of Iraq and Afghanistan is before us . 
It made things worse , not better , '' Ahmadinejad told TVE in an interview at the presidential palace in Tehran , Iran , which was televised in Spain . 
He condemned Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's bombardment of rebels , saying , `` We condemn these massacres and we have condemned them previously . 
Whomever bombs his own people should be condemned . '' 
But Ahmadinejad -- speaking in his native Farsi that was translated to Spanish -- also warned , `` A Western intervention will just complicate the situation . 
The West needs to leave behind its colonialist vision . '' 
He accused the United States and Europe of having provided weapons and backing to Gadhafi and other autocratic regimes in the region in the past . 
`` Previously they helped the government and today they are pretending to help the people , '' he said . 
`` If they do n't intervene in Libyan affairs I think the Libyan people can decide their future . '' 
On Saturday , the Arab League recommended a no-fly zone over Libya . 
In a private session on Monday , the U.N. Security council has expressed doubts and concerns about the measure , meaning quick approval likely will not occur . 
Asked about Iran , Ahmadinejad denied any repression against opposition at home . 
`` Never , never . 
We have never done that . 
During the past 30 years we have had 30 free elections , '' he said . 
The TVE reporter , Ana Pastor , then requested information about Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi . 
`` Are you their lawyer ? '' 
`` In all countries there are opponents . 
And there is also the law . 
If there is an opposition , can they break the law ? ''

The ministers spoke with a sense of urgency about how to respond to the humanitarian and political crisis in Libya .

2011-03-16,"China 's ambassador is concerned about deteriorating conditions in Libya The United States declines to take a public position United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.N. Security Council is considering a new draft resolution that includes a no-fly zone over Libya and additional economic and political sanctions . 
But council nations remain divided on the no-fly zone proposal . 
Germany 's U.N. ambassador said his country has questions about such a zone . 
India 's U.N. ambassador asked , `` Who will implement the no-fly zone ? 
Who would provide assets for it ? '' 
China 's U.N. ambassador said his country is concerned about deteriorating conditions in Libya but did n't say whether Beijing backs a no-fly measure . 
Inside a Libyan rebel training camp Resolution intended to pressure Gadhafi The United States declined to take a public position . 
A council diplomat said the U.S. is engaged in negotiations on the text . 
The resolution is in two main parts . 
The no-fly zone section says the council `` decides to authorize a ban on all flights in the airspace of Libya in order to help protect civilians . '' 
It authorizes member states to `` take all necessary measures to enforce compliance . '' 
Another element refers to helping in the delivery of humanitarian food and supplies . 
There is far more support in the council for the sanctions part , rather than the no-fly-zone . 
The Arab League recommendation of a no-fly zone carries some weight with reluctant council nations . 
But the Arab League declaration that there should be `` no foreign intervention '' has perplexed delegates . 
That 's why Lebanon , the lone Arab member of the Security Council , has been asked to get clarification on this stance from the Arab League . 
Lebanon 's U.N. ambassador said Libyan diplomats at the United Nations will be asked for information on places and safe passages that can be protected by a no - ly zone in an effort to help answer some nations ' questions on the zone . 
Lebanese Ambassador Nawaf Salam told reporters his country is in favor of a no-fly zone that would have a deterrent effect on Libyan government forces . . 
Asked about French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 's remarks that events on the ground may made a no-fly-zone irrelevant , Lebanon 's U.N. ambassador declared `` nothing is too late but may not be enough . '' 
Security Council consultations resume at 11 a.m. Wednesday . 
France 's U.N. ambassador , Gerard Araud , said he doubts a vote will occur Wednesday because the resolution has a long and technical text .

2011-03-16,"By Hamid Ould Ahmed and Mariam Karouny ALGIERS\/TUNIS | Wed Mar 16 , 2011 4:21 pm EDT ALGIERS\/TUNIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces used tanks and artillery on Wednesday to try to retake the city of Misrata , the last big rebel stronghold in western Libya , residents said . 
But rebel fighters in Misrata , on the Mediterranean coast about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of the Libyan capital Tripoli , said they had stalled a ground attack on the city and seized some tanks from pro-Gaddafi units . 
`` The fighters have defeated Gaddafi 's forces from the southern and western side -LRB- of the city -RRB- , '' a resident , who gave his name only as Mohammed , told Reuters by telephone . 
`` The shelling on the city stopped and the rebels have captured some tanks . 
The battle is continuing on the eastern side , but it is not a heavy one . '' 
It was not possible to call Misrata later in the day . 
On Wednesday evening , the online news website Brnieq quoted a telecommunications official in Tripoli as saying Libyan authorities had ordered all mobile and land services cut . 
Earlier , residents and rebel fighters who spoke to Reuters said Gaddafi loyalists had begun to bombard the city at 7:00 a.m -LRB- 0500 GMT -RRB- with tanks , artillery and rockets , in what appeared to be preparation for an assault . 
But they said that ground forces had yet to enter Misrata and were still in the outskirts . 
Accounts of fighting in Misrata could not be verified because Libyan authorities have barred reporters from the city . 
Libyan officials had no immediate comment on reports of an attack . 
A doctor at Misrata hospital said 11 people had been killed and 20 wounded in the fighting . 
He said the wounded were being brought to hospital in private cars because ambulance drivers were afraid of being hit by shells . 
`` We have enough medicine but we are short on staff , '' said the doctor , who gave his name as Muftah . 
A rebel fighter in Misrata , who did not give his name , said the city would make a stand . 
`` They are trying to enter the city . 
I do not think they will be able to do it , at least not today , '' he said . 
The assault on Misrata , Libya 's third-biggest city with a population of about 300,000 , coincides with a rapid advance by Gaddafi 's forces on rebel strongholds in eastern Libya . 
Gaddafi , in power since a military coup in 1969 , lost control of large swathes of Libya in a revolt last month , but since then his security forces have fought back . 
State television made an appeal to the people of Misrata to support the security forces and turn their back on the rebels . 
`` The armed forces are from you and for you , '' the appeal said . 
`` Avoid strife ... This is a call for stability and security for everybody . 
Do not listen to provocation and avoid discord . ''

2011-03-16,"U.S. joins France and UK in urging swift U.N. Libya action 1 of 2 . 
United Nations Security Council diplomats vote on a resolution during a meeting on Libya at U.N. headquarters in New York February 26 , 2011 . 
UNITED NATIONS | Wed Mar 16 , 2011 7:06 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States , France and Britain on Wednesday urged the U.N. Security Council to take swift action on a proposed no-fly zone over Libya , as Washington suggested it might have decided to back the plan . 
The Security Council met through the day behind closed doors to discuss a draft resolution authorizing a no-fly zone to halt Libyan government air strikes on rebels . 
But some council members , including veto powers Russia and China , are either undecided or have doubts . 
British , French and Lebanese envoys distributed the draft on Tuesday after the Arab League called on the council to approve a no-fly zone in Libya . 
Libya 's deputy U.N. envoy Ibrahim Dabbashi , whose denunciation of leader Muammar Gaddafi last month inspired dozens of similar defections by Tripoli 's diplomats worldwide , said there was no time for delays as Gaddafi 's forces continue to pummel rebel forces in the east . 
`` The international community has to act within the next 10 hours , '' said Dabbashi . 
In remarks that suggested a reluctant Washington had now agreed to support the idea of a no-fly zone , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was hopeful the council would take a vote on a Libya resolution no later than Thursday . 
`` We are moving as rapidly as we can in New York to see whether we can get additional authorization for the international community to look at a broad range of actions , not just a no-fly zone but other actions as well , '' Clinton told reporters in Cairo . 
`` We wo n't know until there is an actual vote . 
We 're hoping that will be no later than tomorrow , '' she said . 
Clinton told CBS television that the Arab League call for a no-fly zone had caused a `` sea change '' in thinking . 
`` For the Arab League to call for military action to protect civilians in Libya , against a member of the Arab League , was an extraordinary statement of leadership and real conviction , '' she said . 
`` That has changed the thinking of a lot of people . '' 
Washington had reacted cautiously to the calls for a no-fly zone over Libya , with some officials concerned it could be militarily ineffective or politically damaging . 
It has insisted Arab nations actively participate in any such zone over Libya . 
French U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud told reporters he had formally submitted the draft to the U.N. secretariat with a view to putting it to a vote on Thursday . 
He said council members could propose final amendments overnight . 
Diplomats said Araud was trying to force a vote . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote in a letter to the council that it was `` high time for the international community ... to pull together ... and respond without delay to the urgent appeal of the League of Arab States . '' 
`` Together , we can save the martyred people of Libya , '' he said . 
`` It is now a matter of days , if not hours . 
The worst would be that the appeal of the -LRB- Arab League -RRB- and the Security Council decisions be overruled by the force of arms . '' 
Lebanese Ambassador Nawaf Salam urged the council to act before it was too late for a no-fly zone to have any impact . 
He cited a prediction by Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam that the rebels would be defeated within two days . 
`` It is our hope that the Security Council will impose a no-fly zone quickly and prove him wrong , '' he said . 
Salam said one concern raised by Germany and others -- the apparent clash between the Arab League 's call for a no-fly zone and its opposition to foreign military intervention -- was not a contradiction . 
He said Arab nations would help enforce any no-fly zone authorized by the council . 
`` There will be a significant Arab participation , '' he said . 
Clinton told CBS the Arabs should play a prominent role . 
`` The Arab League statement , their very courageous stance , suggests that they know that they have to step up and lead and participate in any action that would be internationally authorized , '' she said . 
The draft resolution , obtained by Reuters , says the council `` decides to establish a ban on all flights in the airspace of -LRB- Libya -RRB- in order to help protect civilians . '' 
It authorizes member states to `` take all necessary measures to enforce compliance '' and says countries implementing the ban would be doing so in cooperation with the Arab League and in coordination with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . 
The draft also provides for expanding sanctions already slapped by the U.N. council on Libyan leaders on February 26 -- including asset freezes , travel bans and an arms embargo -- to cover all assets abroad of the Gaddafi government .

Tacky , tacky , tacky ... In contrast , check out the rebels ' sofa . 
Comfy , indoor-outdoor , well-worn enough so you do n't mind if your guests sit on it with a bayonet . 
Thanks Blog Guy , we always get a fresh perspective from you . 
How long has there been this bitter division in furniture taste in that part of the world ? 
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's most prominent son , Saif al-Islam , pauses during an interview with Reuters in Tripoli March 10 , 2011 . 
Libya is preparing full-scale military action to crush a rebellion and will not surrender even if Western powers intervene in the conflict , al-Islam said on Thursday .

REUTERS\/Goran Tomasevic BG : I chairish your comments . 
I like how the one rebel dude managed to get a blanket that is sort of like camo against his sofa ! 
Top photo -- Andre now understood why the apartment directly beneath Charlie Sheen 's was so cheap . 
In addition to the constant noise , a weird stain was now coming through his ceiling . 
Guy on right of second photo : ` Hey , how 's the war going ? 
Guy on left of second photo : ` Sofa , so good ' If I may ask the opinion of those OEers with military experience , are bayonets still useful attached to an AK or is it just there to look badass ? 
I just get the impression that if one ca n't off a dude on the charge with an AK even by spray-and-pray then whipping around a bayonet all Wii controller style is n't gonna be much of a help either . 
I guess Gaddafi is the sofa king ? 
As for the comfy guys -- `` you go to war with the army you have , not the army you wish you had '' becomes very relevant . 
@ifly -- still nothing like cold steel on the end of a rifle to close the deal . 
We still train our guys on its proper use too . 
Usually , it 's just good to open MREs with . 
Arent we all feeling witty today ! 
Unfortunately my head is all foogged in , mirroring the weather outside so , I am gonna go couch potato ... . 
You 're the expert , Dave , but as I recall from my days in the National Guard , another option is to `` open '' the MREs on fully automatic , and then go eat at a nice restaurant ... Looks like the rebels have sold out of alarm clocks . 
Now they 're selling letter openers ... In the U.S. Army , I learned all about the parry , slash , strike , etc. . 
I also learned use of the M-16 in hand-to-hand combat : for example , I learned the `` vertical butt-stroke . '' 
-LRB- Everyone see why Ifly asked about this ? -RRB- 
We also learned unarmed defense , including judo . 
But that was the military police bootcamp and academy , which was its own little corps . 
Gives Rooms To Go a whole new meaning ... `` Buy a sofa this week , get a free RPG ! '' 
@Doc , yeah I totally asked that in hopes someone would say `` vertical butt-stroke '' . 
Thanks for obliging me . 
Now when I said `` whipping around a bayonet all Wii controller style '' I of course was not refering to military training but to Mr. Lay-Z-Rebel up there . 
From the actual MRE manual : Scroll down the the last picture . 
And yes the written instructions on the bag do say ` Place against a rock or something ' . 
@nosmo -- I knew guys who went crazy looking for those `` or somethings '' . 
Wait -- they may have already been crazy . 
We ate K-rations in the field . 
I remember sitting high on a snowy mountainside in Bavaria , opening a can of pork cutlets with a P-38 . 
When I got the can open , the cutlets and jelly were frozen . 
I was wearing long johns , M-1951 wool field pants -LRB- with liner -RRB- , M-1951 wool field shirt , an M-1967 field jacket -LRB- with liner -RRB- and an M-1951 fishtail parka . 
-LRB- It was one of the few made with real wolf fur on the hood . -RRB- 
My friend Robby was yelling `` I will trade anything for pound cake . '' 
@Doc , you opened a can of pork cutlets with a P-38 Lightning ? 
Wow , now that is way hardcore and badass ! 
Did you use the prop or had the pilots do a strafing run ? 
It was a wonky old P-38 can opener . 
We would n't use anything that was n't wonky . 
@Doc , oh . . 
a can opener huh ? 
Well hey is it coolio with you if I just stick with thinking you used an airplane ? 
And it will definitely be wonky ! 
A wonky airplane is what you used ! 
Unca ... is a family blog really the place to be talking about your unsheathed bayonet ? 
I believe one can still buy these over the Internet . 
My mountainside memory must be one of eating an MCI , because only the MCIs had pound cake as a dessert item . 
I think the meat item was supposed to be ham , but it did not look like ham . 
I can still see it . 
I think we used it as a hockey puck . 
Okay then , when we have the big OE Commenters Gala we will be serving C-Rations and K-Rations . 
Do n't forget to state your preference on the registration form . 
My preference will be a write in choice for the OE Gala menu ! 
I think I can fit a sandwich in my purse , and I so hope there will be doughnuts for dessert ! 
I want to donate a love seat to the rebels . 
Sent with lots of love . 
If Charlie leaves his stained apartment , he is NOT allowed to sit on it ... BG : you mentioned there is a `` bitter division in furniture taste '' there . 
Are they eating the furniture ? 
Can Lamar send the rebels some doughnuts ? 
Fresh ones , so they do n't have to get crumbs on their bayonets trying to cut them in half . 
Looks like we can get some good hotel deals in Yemen .

2011-03-17,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan rebel : We 've seen heavy gunfire NEW : U.S. Ambassador Rice : We are seriously considering a range of options Gadhafi may commit genocide , Libyan U.N. envoy says Four New York Times journalists are reported missing in Libya Fighting rages in Ajdabiya , the last rebel town between Gadhafi and rebel stronghold Ajdabiya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces battled rebels for the cities of Misrata and Ajdabiya on Wednesday , according to witnesses and CNN staff on the ground . 
In Ajdabiya , airstrikes , heavy bombardment and fighting between the rebels and pro-Gadhafi forces began after the rebels were able to take control of some positions in the eastern Libyan city overnight . 
Thousands of government forces eventually gathered outside Ajdabiya with dozens of heavy artillery pieces , radar control weapons systems and about a dozen tanks , CNN 's Nic Robertson reported from just outside the city . 
AK-47s and Katyusha rockets were among the weapons carried by government soldiers , who appeared jubilant and confident about a possible upcoming battle for the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
Gadhafi forces move in on opposition The troops were carried in white pickups , many of which were covered in dirt for camouflage purposes . 
Witnesses said pro-Gadhafi snipers were positioned in various parts of the city . 
Ajdabiya is the last major point between pro-government forces and Benghazi . 
If it is retaken by pro-Gadhafi forces , it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition 's base . 
In Misrata , west of Ajdabiya , Gadhafi `` is bombing his way into the city , '' witness Mohamed Ali said . 
`` He does n't care if all the people -LRB- there -RRB- are dead by the end of the day . '' 
Ali accused Gadhafi of launching a `` cowardly , murderous attack . '' 
`` People are not safe . 
It 's amazing that this is happening , '' Ali said , adding that two people have been killed and 15 injured , one `` very critically . '' 
He said Gadhafi 's forces had not yet been able to get into the city . 
Ali described described himself as a 46-year-old IT engineer and a member of the local opposition council . 
He called himself a rebel fighter but said he had no weapons . 
The rebels are fighting with whatever arms they can capture from government troops , he said , such as Kalashnikov rifles . 
`` The best we have '' is rocket-propelled grenade launchers , he said . 
CNN journalists in Libya were not able to reach Misrata to confirm Ali 's account . 
But a second witness also said the city came under sustained attack by forces loyal to Gadhafi on Wednesday . 
The tank and artillery fire went on for at least two hours , he said . 
`` We hear very , very , very loud explosions , '' said the witness , who did not want to be named . 
`` They have cut off electricity and water . '' 
Meanwhile , four New York Times journalists covering the conflict were reported missing by the newspaper Wednesday . 
Editors said they had received second-hand information that some of the reporting team `` had been swept up by Libyan government forces '' in Ajdabiya . 
Frustration and anger in Benghazi Ambassador : U.S. , UN must act in Libya Inside a Libyan rebel training camp Resolution intended to pressure Gadhafi Government forces said they had no information about the missing journalists and said that if they were picked up by the Libyan military , they would have been taken back to Tripoli . 
Gadhafi 's battles to recapture a number of rebel-held towns and cities come on the day the United Nations Security Council considered imposing a no-fly zone over Libya . 
Wednesday ended with no agreement on a draft resolution , but several diplomats expressed optimism that a vote would come soon . 
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said late Wednesday that envoys were considering a variety of options to protect civilians in Libya , not just a no-fly zone or a cease fire . 
Susan Rice said a `` range of actions '' were up for serious discussion , including but not limited to a no-fly zone , which has `` inherent limitations in terms of protection of civilians . '' 
A diplomatic source told CNN that air strikes are among options being discussed as diplomats focus on what should be in a U.N. Security Council resolution . 
The international community is keenly aware of the urgency and gravity of the situation on ground , Rice continued . 
She said she hopes to see a serious resolution as early as Thursday . 
The French Ambassador had earlier confirmed that text for a new draft resolution on Libya had been submitted to diplomats . 
He also told reporters that he expected a vote on the resolution within 24 hours . 
Lebanon 's U.N. ambassador , Nawaf Salam , said Arab countries are committed to participating in a no-fly zone . 
That has been an apparent prerequisite for U.S. support of such a zone . 
The Lebanese diplomat would n't detail the level of potential Arab participation but said it would be `` significant '' and said it has `` been confirmed by the highest political authorities . '' 
The French foreign minister said on his blog Wednesday that several Arab countries would be willing to participate in a targeted attack on Gadhafi 's air assets . 
The minister , Alain Juppe , did not specify which countries or how they would participate . 
Without implementation of a no-fly zone , rebels fear that it is only a matter of time before there is a bloodbath in Benghazi . 
Libya 's deputy ambassador to the U.N. expressed this fear Wednesday . 
Gadhafi `` has given instructions for ethnic cleansing , '' Ibrahim Dabbashi said , adding that the Libyan leader would commit genocide against rebels if he was not stopped by the international community . 
Dabbashi said he expects the Security Council to produce a draft resolution soon . 
`` International consensus is in the process of building , '' Dabbashi said in the Security Council 's briefing room . 
Dabbashi made headlines in February when he joined with Libyan Ambassador to the U.N. Mohamed Shalgham to condemn Gadhafi and request that he step down as Libya 's leader . 
Libya 's government has subsequently requested that Dabbashi and Shalgham be denied the right to speak for Libya at the United Nations . 
Women marched in Benghazi on Wednesday , carrying banners reading , `` how many Libyans must die to get the Security Council to move on . '' 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters Wednesday that opinions in a number of countries initially opposed to the imposition of a no-fly zone shifted after the Arab League announced its support for such a step . 
`` Intense negotiations '' are underway at the Security Council , she said . 
`` We are moving as rapidly as we can to get additional authorization . '' 
A council diplomat said Washington was engaged in negotiations on the text . 
Germany 's U.N. ambassador said his country has still questions about such a zone . 
India 's U.N. ambassador asked , `` Who will implement the no-fly zone ? 
Who would provide assets for it ? '' 
China 's U.N. ambassador said his country is concerned about deteriorating conditions in Libya but did n't say whether Beijing backs a no-fly measure . 
Ali , the opposition leader in Misrata , urged China and Russia to `` look in the mirror '' and understand that `` they are hindering the international effort to put this war criminal in his place . '' 
While the Arab League recommendation of a no-fly zone carried some weight with reluctant council nations , another declaration from the league that there should be `` no foreign intervention '' has perplexed delegates . 
En route to Washington after a weekend trip to Bahrain , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday that the logistical challenges of enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya could be overcome . 
`` If we are directed to impose a no-fly zone , we have the resources to do it , '' he said . 
`` The question is whether it 's a wise thing to do . 
And that 's the discussion that 's going at a political level . ''

2011-03-17,"From Richard Roth , CNN Senior U.N. Correspondent Libya says its troops will protect civilians The Security Council approves measures against Libya Read the resolution approved by the U.N. Security Council -LRB- PDF -RRB- United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jubilant Libyan rebels in Benghazi erupted with fireworks and gunfire after the U.N. Security Council voted Thursday evening to impose a no-fly zone and permit `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . 
The opposition , with devoted but largely untrained and under-equipped units , has suffered military setbacks this week . 
It has said such international action was necessary for it to have any chance of thwarting Moammar Gadhafi 's imminent assault on the rebel stronghold . 
`` We 're hoping and praying that the United Nations will come up with a very firm and very fast resolution and they will enforce it immediately , '' said Ahmed El-Gallal , a senior opposition coordinator , before the vote . 
`` We should not arrive too late , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said at the U.N. . 
The resolution was approved with 10 votes , including those of the United States and the United Kingdom . 
There were no opposing votes on the 15-member council , but China , Russia , Germany , India and Brazil abstained . 
Germany said it was concerned about a protracted military conflict . 
U.N. member states can `` take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force , '' according to the resolution . 
Moments after the vote , anti-Gadhafi forces in Benghazi broke into cheers , waving flags and chanting . 
Antiaircraft tracer fire lit up the sky at one rally . 
UN approves no-fly zone in Libya Libyan amb . 
still hopeful for airstrikes UN okays no-fly zone in Libya It was not immediately clear just how an international military operation and possible strikes against the Libyan military might unfold . 
The no-fly zone prohibits Libya 's air forces from entering certain zones within the country . 
The United States and NATO partners have contingencies in place to act within hours , according to an administration official familiar with planning . 
President Barack Obama will insist on a major Arab role in any no-fly zone , the official said . 
The contingencies include air strikes and cruise missile attacks designed to cripple Libyan air defenses and punish military units leading Gadhafi 's push on opposition strongholds in the east , the official said . 
Obama called British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy after the vote . 
The three `` agreed that Libya must immediately comply with all terms of the resolution and that violence against the civilian population of Libya must cease , '' the White House said in a statement . 
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim , speaking in Tripoli , told reporters after the vote that the country will safeguard civilians and its territorial integrity . 
He called on the international community to send a fact-finding mission to the African nation but not lend material support to rebels . 
A few dozen pro-Gadhafi supporters chanted , `` Down with the U.N. ! 
Down with the United States ! '' 
Frustration and anger in Benghazi Libyan rebel : We 've seen heavy gunfire Friedman predicts more unrest in Mideast Gadhafi forces move in on opposition The U.S. military does not view a no-fly zone alone as sufficient to stop Gadhafi . 
Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that establishing a zone would take `` upwards of a week . '' 
U.S. military officials have said that a no-fly zone would not halt the heavy artillery the regime is using on the ground . 
Gadhafi 's son Saadi told CNN Thursday evening that troops will change their tactics and take up positions around Benghazi Saturday or Sunday and assist people fleeing from the city . 
The younger Gadhafi said there will be no large-scale assault . 
Instead police and anti-terrorism units will be sent into the rebel stronghold to disarm the opposition . 
Unspecified humanitarian groups can help with the exodus of civilians from Benghazi , Saadi Gadhafi said . 
In a radio address aired on Libyan state TV , Gadhafi criticized residents of Benghazi and called them `` traitors '' for seeking help from outsiders . 
The Security Council resolution condemns the `` gross and systematic violation of human rights , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , torture and summary executions . '' 
It details enforcement of an arms embargo against Libya , the freezing of assets and a ban on most flights . 
`` The United States stands with the Libyan people in support of their universal rights , '' said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice . 
The resolution deplores the use of mercenaries by Libyan authorities , expresses concern about the safety of foreign nationals and demands an immediate cease-fire . 
Kaim said the Gadhafi government supports a cease-fire , but is working out certain details . 
The Arab League 's U.N. ambassador , Yahya Mahmassani , said two Arab countries would take part in a no-fly zone operation , but he was not sure which two . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Arab League will be critical to the response to Gadhafi , and that he will travel to the region `` to advance our common efforts in this critical hour . '' 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the U.N. vote shows the need for Libyan citizens `` to have a more representative government . '' 
Earlier Thursday , Libyan state TV said Benghazi would soon come under attack . 
Gadhafi said that his forces would enter the city to rid it of those `` traitors '' and that his forces will search everyone for weapons . 
He added that his forces gave amnesty to those who gave up their weapons in the city of Ajdabiya . 
`` We will not allow further bloodshed among Libyans , '' Gadhafi said . 
`` Search for the traitors , for the fanatics . 
Show them no mercy . 
We will look for them behind every wall , '' Gadhafi said . 
`` This farce can not go on . '' 
There were air strikes on Benghazi 's airport Thursday , with three blasts hitting the site about 30 kilometers -LRB- about 18 miles -RRB- outside the city . 
The opposition has been using the airport to launch its own air strikes , using a handful of jets that rebels have managed to get off the ground , opposition leaders said . 
It is not clear that Gadhafi 's ground forces are actually within striking range of Benghazi , but they have been fighting their way in that direction for several days . 
State TV claimed Thursday that Gadhafi 's forces were in control of Ajdabiya , on the road to Benghazi , a claim disputed by opposition leaders . 
El-Gallal , speaking from eastern Libya , said `` morale is high '' and people do not want to leave strongholds because Gadhafi `` is willing to kill everybody here . '' 
The government forces have taken control of the eastern and western gates to Ajdabiya and are trying to breach the inside , opposition leaders said . 
The opposition says it controls the southern entrance . 
The opposition says it has a handful of jets that are no match with Gadhafi 's superior air power and a pair of Russian-made `` Hind '' attack helicopters . 
Ajdabiya is the last major point between pro-government forces and Benghazi . 
If it is retaken by pro-Gadhafi forces , it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition 's base . 
In remarks to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee , William Burns , the under secretary for political affairs at the State Department , said Gadhafi 's forces are only about 160 kilometers outside Benghazi . 
`` They 've made advances , taking full advantage of their overwhelming military superiority in military firepower , '' Burns said . 
He expressed fear that Gadhafi , now isolated by the world community , could turn to terrorism again . 
`` I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground , that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well : The danger of him returning to terrorism and violent extremism himself , the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region , '' Burns told the committee .

2011-03-17,"By the CNN Wire Staff The Libyan government says it has no information on the four One of the missing journalists e-mailed Monday about the danger in Libya The New York Times has been in touch with the Libyan government The missing journalists include one who was kidnapped by the Taliban in 2009 -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four journalists for The New York Times , including two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Shadid and MacArthur `` genius grant '' recipient Lynsey Addario , are missing in Libya , the newspaper said Wednesday on its website . 
Editors at the paper said they had last been in touch with the journalists Tuesday morning , U.S. Eastern time , according to the report . 
It said the newspaper received secondhand information that `` members of its reporting team on the ground in the port city of Ajdabiya had been swept up by Libyan government forces . '' 
However , the newspaper has been unable to confirm those reports , Executive Editor Bill Keller said on the newspaper 's website . 
`` We have talked with officials of the Libyan government in Tripoli , and they tell us they are attempting to ascertain the whereabouts of our journalists , '' Keller said . 
`` We are grateful to the Libyan government for their assurance that if our journalists were captured they would be released promptly and unharmed . '' 
Libyan rebel : We 've seen heavy gunfire A battle raged Wednesday in Ajdabiya between government troops and rebels . 
Bob Christie , senior vice president for corporate communications at The New York Times Co. , said Wednesday that the Libyan government told the newspaper it was unaware of the journalists ' whereabouts . 
`` They 've told us they have a lot of prisoners and that they 're processing them '' and suggested that the four could turn up in that process , Christie said . 
Libyan government forces said Wednesday that they have no information about where the journalists may be and that , if they were picked up by the Libyan military , they would be returned to Tripoli . 
The newspaper identified the journalists as Shadid , its bureau chief in Beirut , Lebanon , and two-time Pulitzer winner for foreign reporting ; Stephen Farrell , a reporter and videographer who was kidnapped by the Taliban and rescued by British commandos in 2009 ; and Tyler Hicks and Addario , photographers who have covered the Middle East and Africa . 
`` Their families and their colleagues at The Times are anxiously seeking information about their situation , and praying that they are safe , '' Keller said . 
Addario , a freelancer based in India , recently won a MacArthur Fellowship -- known as a `` genius grant '' -- for her photography around the world . 
In an e-mail Monday to CNN correspondent Ivan Watson , Addario called the Libya story `` one of the most dangerous '' of her career . 
The e-mail said , `` qaddafi 's forces heading back east , and the rebels are surrendering along the way ... so exhausted . 
this story has been one of the most dangerous i have ever covered . 
getting bombed from the air and by land . '' 
Addario 's husband , Paul de Bendern , told CNN that his wife travels to conflict zones because they 're powerful stories . 
He was anxious to see his wife 's return . 
`` It 's very difficult . 
We 're here , we 're waiting . 
I want my wife back , '' said de Bendern , who is bureau chief in New Delhi , India , for Reuters . 
`` Lynsey is a very smart woman , funny and brave , '' he added . 
`` She 's very passionate about what she 's doing . 
... She tells the world of these important things with the beauty of her photography . '' 
While working as a foreign correspondent , Shadid was shot in the shoulder by the Israeli Army in Ramallah in spring 2002 . 
Farrell routinely reports from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Iraq . 
Before joining The New York Times in 2007 , he worked for the Times of London . 
In April 2004 , he was kidnapped while on assignment in Iraq . 
Hicks , a staffer for the paper , is based in Istanbul and has served as an embed in Afghanistan . 
In a 2004 interview with the StarNews of Wilmington , North Carolina , Hicks described how he felt about his job : `` Covering conflicts is a very rewarding experience because you can bring attention to global issues . 
When I 'm working and a photograph appears in The New York Times , I always remind myself of who is seeing that photograph '' and the number of people it may have reached , he said . 
`` That is when I can go to bed at night and feel good about what I have done that day . '' 
Hicks and Addario are both from Westport , Connecticut .

2011-03-17,"Libya 's civil war and U.N. intervention The U.N. Security Council voted March 17 to authorize a no-fly zone over Libya and to `` take all necessary measures '' - without using an occupation force - to protect civilians and population centers under the threat of attack in Libya . 
Click the markers to learn more about the intervention in Libya , and scroll down to learn more about the developments in Libya 's civil war . 
The U.N. authorization establishes a ban on all flights in Libyan airspace to help protect civilians . 
The exceptions are : Flights by U.N. member states for the purpose of enforcing the flight ban Humanitarian flights -LRB- such as those delivering medical supplies , food and humanitarian workers -RRB- Any flights `` which are deemed necessary '' by nations enforcing the no-fly zone U.S. military officials have said that a no-fly zone would typically be enforced by fighter jets . 
In addition to the no-fly zone , the U.N. resolution authorizes governments to freeze assets of Libyan authorities and inspect cargo of vessels suspected of carrying arms or mercenaries , by force if necessary . 
"
2011-03-17,"2 men charged in death of Chicago teen who performed in inauguration event . 
Diplomats warned that action was needed to halt Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's rapid advances against rebel positions in his country . 
The broadly worded resolution would seem to leave open the possibility that air forces implementing the no-fly zone may not only prevent Libyan military aircraft from flying , but also target Gadhafi s wider ability to wage war . 
We ve been told by diplomats this could certainly indeed move the door so that you have a more of a robust military approach by the West , by Arab countries to help the rebels and stop Col. Gadhafi from reaching Benghazi , said CNN s senior U.N. correspondent , Richard Roth . 
The authorization establishes a ban on all flights in Libyan airspace to help protect civilians . 
The exceptions are : -- Flights by U.N. member states for the purpose of enforcing the flight ban -- Humanitarian flights -LRB- such as those delivering medical supplies , food and humanitarian workers -RRB- -- Any flights which are deemed necessary by nations enforcing the no-fly zone . 
U.S. military officials have said that a no-fly zone would typically be enforced by fighter jets . 
A no-fly zone could cost up to $ 300 million a week , according to data obtained by CNN s Barbara Starr . 
Protect civilians and civilian populated areas In addition to the no-fly zone , the resolution authorizes member states to take all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , including Benghazi . 
However , the resolution prohibits `` a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . '' 
Roth , reporting on CNN and CNN International , said that the exact composition of the nations that would participate wasn t immediately clear . 
The Arab League 's U.N. ambassador , Yahya Mahmassani , said two Arab countries would take part in a no-fly zone operation , but he was not sure which two . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States would not act without a U.N. resolution . 
The United States has said it wants Arab nations to take part in no-fly zone . 
Asked whether France will be involved in strikes against Libya if a resolution was passed , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday at the United Nations that `` France is available with others to put the resolution in action , including in this domain . '' 
Germany , one of five nations on the Security Council to abstain from Thursday s vote , said it would not contribute any forces . 
The other nations that abstained from Thursday 's vote were Russia , China , Brazil and India . 
China and Russia are the usual suspects among the abstainers , but the presence of democratic nations like Germany , India and Brazil in that group somehow bothers me . 
$ 300 million per week just for no fly zone . 
You will b poorer than last year for sure . 
lol Hope America wins the oil in Libya soon otherwise all Americans will suffer more deficits and of cause you will lost your job , house and perhaps your wives will run away to China and marry rich Chinese men over there . 
lol It is really stupid to have war in time of huge deficit . 
It seems that America is hunger for foreign oil and money . 
Win the war and create more American contract to cover the expenses of Libya war . 
China , you are smart . 
Save every single cent and let America borrows from you . 
Eventually you will control America 's economy and politic someday .

Col Qadaffi had arrived in 1969 as Islamic : `` Brother Gamal abdul Nasser I have arrived to avenge Israel for 1967 Six day War '' ? 
Unfortunately I had mailed him a letter of reminder with my job address and tel Phone as best skilled best eductaed person of G8 . 
My photo and address is in http : www . 
islamic socialclub.wordpress.com Another war adventure costing billions and we do n't know when it will end despite the GFC and the hardships of some nations on the brink of total bankruptcy . 
Such wasted resources to make a point against someone we dislike has become history revisited . 
Change regime doctrine is still stuck with US troops in Iraq and the millions of death and destruction . 
But this time will be different . 
Watch what will happen to Paris and London next . 
Do n't blame the Colonel . 
He will be gone likely but his ghost will freeze EU capitals for decades . 
Libyans are tribal and will sort their stuff out amongst themselves but the ` culprits ' who set them up against each other will pay . 
Well put , Marinari . 
This country 's being run by a bunch of guys who were bullies in their high school days ! 
That seems to be all they know . 
We 'll let Egypt and Saudi handle it . 
But , I DO find it interesting how you threatened EUROPE , when it is pretty much certain that the US would handle it . 
Cute , but anyone with more than a week 's experience in the REAL world of military action and diplomacy KNOWS who you are . 
So , I 'll give you a hint , say hello to Iblis for us . 
I 'm in agreement with Cesar on Personny . 
I ` lm gonna go hug my toilet and regurgitate what you wrote and I read . 
Your ignorance is all too telling . 
You do n't have a clue about anything . 
What are you ... 12 ? 
Yes I think this will be the last time France intervenes for a LONG time . 
Their president had better start packing his bags now , because he 's headed the way of Tony Blair . 
Barba , so you want Gadaffi to kill all his people so as to be able to hang on to power , and you want the whole world to turn their head away . 
What has he being doing in his 40 + years of ruling . 
He has nothing more to offer , if he had ever had any . 
Point Godwin reached immediately by you ... And the point is certainly not there . 
If this was just for oil , those nations would have treated with Khadaffi regime , like before , because they already have commercial contracts wih Libya -LRB- those commercial contracts will be honored , there 's not been any seizure of equipement or oil , only a freeze on assets that will return to Libyan people as soon as possible -RRB- . 
The faxt is that Khaddafi has not only threatened his own people , but also renewed his terrorist threats . 
And that can not be tolerated . 
What happens in Libya was initially a street protest , it is Khadaffi that has forced the evolution into civil war by buying the services of lots of foreign terrorists to attack its opposition . 
And that 's why there 's not just a no-fly zone , but more importantly a decision to close the borders of Lybia to avoid invasions of mercenaries paid by Khadaffi , notably in Chad . 
The most important decision will be to enforce the absence of troup movements from the Southern borders of Libya . 
, and stopping the planes coming from there to South Libya where they are given firearms and heavy equipments to attack the North where most Libyan population lives . 
Those mercenaries must be arrested . 
They are since the begining the ONLY invaders and foreign forces that have occupied the Libyan territory . 
In other words , Khaddafi is the main treator of his own country , deliberately acting to threaten his own population that he is normally deemed to protect . 
For this reason , The no-fly zone will be implemented not just from Mediterranean sea , but also from the South . 
We can hope the collaboration by Egypt to offer its airports in Southern Egypt to control the Chadian border . 
And now the resolution can also help the poor Chadian country to get involved in the alliance and receive help to avoid the damaging action there by current Lybian leaders -LRB- and notably by the Libyan `` ambassador '' in Chad that is no longer acting as a diplomat but as an recruiter -RRB- . 
And the money for the Libyan oil or gas must not be used by Khadaffi to pay foreign mercenaries against its people . 
In fact Khadaffi has lost the opposition to the resolution as soon as he has renewed its terrorist threats , and directly threatened European countries -LRB- including civils -RRB- . 
It 's clearly unacceptable . 
And you 'll immediately note that , in France , despite of the strong political opposition to Sarkhozy -LRB- and the ongoing local elections currently occuring this week -RRB- , even the opposition has supported the no-fly zone and immediate implementation of it . 
There 's a consensus that the Libyan democratic spring must not be stopped and that the terrorist threats of Khadaffi are completely unacceptable . 
We have learned from Tunisia and Egypt . 
And we already know that we have support from most Arabic populations of the Middle-East . 
Clearly the Libyan spring is definitely not a threat for us . 
And the Libyan people was the first demander of the no-fly zone . 
If only Khadaffi had spent its money to help develop Chad instead of buying mercenaries against its own people , the situation would have been radically different . 
Khadaffi resists only to keep power by force . 
No legitimate country can reject the opinion of its people . 
When the situation is so critical that thrre are protests and a new opposition forming , the only legitimate thing that can be done is to organize elections , not war against his oppponents . 
And accept to resign and loose . 
But before this happens , the country leader must still protect his people . 
Khadaffi , by sending mercenaries against his people has clearly acted as a war criminal . 
He is no longer trustable : he lied in the past , we have given him a limited trust that he woruld fight terrorism and act reasonnably . 
We can not given him a second chance . 
And that 's why France decided to recognize the Parliament of Benghazzi -LRB- even if its still very informal , and still needs to organize itself and prepare its move to organize a new civilian society and regime , with elections -RRB- as the only legitimate representant of the Libyan people because it is the only one that has not threatened any one , inside or outside the country , and offered assistance to help protect humanitarian assistance , or to protect hospitals . 
You really need to study your history better . 
It is quite easy to play war if the war zone is away from yr . 
, country !!!! UK ; France , USA , if the playyard would be closer to yr home , you would think twice before entering into a war game . 
We in Italy are closest to Libya and North-African countries , nobody is helping us dealing with all refugees that arrived lately in Sicily , and our government is playing hard with northern african main-gas-oil-supplier . 
Offering our military basis is not THE SOLUTION ... ... ... ... WE STUPID ITALIANS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We have many arab people in our country and I am sure this will be the beginning of the 3rd world war . 
We are all CRAZY to get into this . 
Already many years ago -LRB- who knows who did it ?? -RRB- did ` nt succeed in hitting Geddaf 's plane and the CIVILIAN PLANE in Ustica wash hit -LRB- by mistake ?????? -RRB- not even able to distinguish a civilian plane from another plane ... -RRB- . 
So many INNOCENT people died . 
ABSURD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just let them decide their future and destiny . 
This country of ours founded upon slavery has been since its origination , a complete hypocriscy .

2011-03-18,"This is a recent satellite image of Benghazi in eastern Libya . 
The nation 's second-largest city , it is held by rebels . 
NEW : Consensus is against using U.S. ground troops , congressional leader says Goal of U.N. 's efforts is to stop violence against Libyan people , official says But ultimate goal of U.S. policy is to force Gadhafi to step down Administration 's main approach is to keep international community focused Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Even as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the ultimate goal for the U.S. was to see Libya 's president cede power , a senior administration official says the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone and military action to support it would not necessarily last until Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi steps down . 
This official , who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue , said that `` right now , we 're focused on stopping the violence . '' 
Clinton said Friday , `` The first and overwhelming urgent action is to end the violence . 
And we have to see a clear set of decisions that are operationalized on the ground by Gadhafi 's forces to move physically a significant distance away from the east , where they have been pursuing their campaign against the opposition . '' 
The purpose of the no-fly zone , the administration official said , is to prevent Gadhafi from attacking his own people . 
`` It 's not designed to have him go . 
That 's not the purpose , '' the official said . 
`` The purpose of the military action is to prevent massive humanitarian loss of life , to stop the violence . 
If the violence stops , then you should n't leap to say then the military action will continue until he leaves . '' 
No-fly zones : Do they work ? 
Obama : Libya terms ` not negotiable ' Libya opposition : Civilian areas shelled Libya reacts to no-fly zone The ultimate aim of U.S. policy , the administration official said , remains to force Gadhafi step down . 
But to accomplish that , the administration 's strategy hinges on `` sequencing . '' 
`` There are a lot of different measures , '' the official said . 
`` If you have a cease-fire in place that is verifiable , then you can continue turning the noose without taking necessarily further action . 
What we 're trying to do is freeze his advance . 
And then work from there to what was the original call , which was that he has lost legitimacy and he needs to go . 
But you have to sequence it . '' 
The official conceded that there are many scenarios that could unfold : Gadhafi could remove his forces , or he could temporarily cease attacking , only to later resume fighting . 
A standoff could ensue . 
`` That is exactly the crux of the matter . 
No one can define that . '' 
But , this official says , the administration 's main approach now is : `` Keep the international community focused on this , and the result will be that he leaves , but that may take some time . '' 
A top State Department official raised the concern that Gadhafi could return to underwriting terror plots . 
`` I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground , that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well , '' Undersecretary Nicholas Burns said Thursday . 
`` The danger of him returning to terrorism , and violent extremism himself , the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region . '' 
But a second U.S. official said the intelligence community has been assessing the Libyan leader 's capabilities and intentions . 
There is no indication that Gadhafi will respond with a terrorist attack ; he is `` distracted by events in his country , '' but the official said `` no one is discounting his brutality . '' 
The official said it is unlikely Gadhafi could orchestra a `` sophisticated plot '' such as the Pan Am Flight 103 or Berlin disco bombings , but there is always the possibility of smaller-scale attacks . 
President Barack Obama met Friday with security officials and leaders of Congress , including Rep. Mike Rogers , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee . 
The Michigan Republican said there was a consensus against putting American troops on Libyan soil . 
`` I think that is a terrible idea . 
It would be a terrible option , '' said Rogers , who supports the no-fly zone . 
`` I ca n't foresee a circumstance that would require U.S. soldiers on the ground in Libya . '' 
Rogers said that protecting civilians and chemical weapon stockpiles are the top priorities . 
`` This buffer zone is incredibly important to protect those people and other Libyans who have stood up to Gadhafi and said ` no more , we want freedom and self-rule , ' '' the congressman said .

The paper cites an interview with Moammar Gadhafi 's son He says female photographer Lynsey Addario will be released The paper says the Libyan government promised to free the other three The Times last heard from the journalists on Tuesday New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four New York Times journalists missing in Libya have been captured by pro-government forces but will be released , the newspaper reported Friday . 
The Times cited an interview given by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , to ABC 's Christiane Amanpour late Thursday , a transcript of which was posted on ABC 's website . 
In it , the younger Gadhafi says photographer Lynsey Addario will be released . 
He tells Amanpour that security forces arrested her because she had entered the country illegally , `` but then they were happy because they found out she is American , not European . 
And thanks to that , she will be free tomorrow . '' 
Husband of missing journalist speaks out While Gadhafi did not mention the other three missing journalists , the Times said Libyan government officials told the U.S. State Department on Thursday evening that all four would be released . 
The paper also said the Libyan government allowed the journalists to call their families Thursday evening . 
`` We 're all , families and friends , overjoyed to know they are safe , '' the paper quoted its executive editor , Bill Keller , as saying . 
`` We are eager to have them free and back home . '' 
CNN could not independently confirm promises to release the journalists . 
Saif al-Islam Gadhafi does not speak for all parts of the Libyan government . 
The newspaper identified the journalists as Anthony Shadid , its bureau chief in Beirut , Lebanon , and a two-time Pulitzer winner for foreign reporting ; Stephen Farrell , a reporter and videographer who was kidnapped by the Taliban and rescued by British commandos in 2009 ; and Tyler Hicks and Addario , photographers who have covered the Middle East and Africa . 
Addario is an experienced war photographer based in India who recently won a MacArthur Fellowship -- known as a `` genius grant '' -- for her photography around the world . 
Hicks , a staffer for the paper , is based in Istanbul and has served as an embedded journalist in Afghanistan . 
The four journalists entered the rebel-controlled eastern region of Libya via the Egyptian border without visas to cover the civil war in the country , the Times said . 
Editors at the paper said they had last been in touch with the journalists Tuesday morning . 
The paper said that after it reported losing contact , the Gadhafi government pledged that if the four had been detained by the government 's military forces , they would be located and released unharmed .

`` We will provide the unique capabilities that we can bring to bear to stop the violence against civilians , including enabling our European allies and Arab partners to effectively enforce a no-fly zone , '' the president said in a nationally televised statement about U.S. military action . 
`` The president chose his words deliberately and carefully , and you should be guided by them , '' the official said .

Enforcement of a no-fly zone over Libya could begin in hours , a French government spokesman said on Friday . 
This reminds me of 1919 when the League of Nations assigned France to mandate Lebanon in order to ` create a better future ' for the countries that were extricated from the Ottoman Empire . 
However , the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement and Balfour Declaration proved the typical colonization goals and not the alleged aiding goals . 
Similarly , the French ` assistance ' to the Libyans will turn be the mask of secret colonization treaties .

2011-03-18,"As far as I can tell , Americans have not been provided with sufficient evidence of mass atrocities committed by the Gadhafi regime to justify a military intervention on humanitarian grounds alone . 
Nor has the administration made a case that the alternative to Gadhafi justifies the risk of removing him . 
Members of both political parties are prone to support humanitarian intervention to stop war crimes and given Gadhafi 's past , it seems a strong case could be made that an alternative to him would be in the U.S. interest . 
But it is somewhat shocking that the U.S. is preparing to take military action against Libya and neither of those arguments have been convincingly made .

2011-03-18,"Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa announces cease-fire campaign against rebels Follows earlier vote by U.N. Security Council to impose no-fly zone in Libya Member states authorized `` to take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians U.S. , France , Britain lead countries offering to contribute military assets -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's embattled regime declared a cease-fire Friday as an international coalition was preparing to enforce a United Nations-backed no-fly zone to protect civilians in the war-torn country . 
The U.N. Security Council vote followed recent successes by heavily-armed government forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi against the largely untrained and under-equipped rebels . 
Pro-government forces were thought to be on the brink of an assault on Benghazi -- a city of one million people seized by the opposition during the uprising -- and had reportedly launched air attacks . 
Despite the announcement of a cease-fire , there were reports of fighting Friday in western and eastern Libya . 
Acting under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter , which provides for the use of force if needed , the Council adopted Resolution 1973 by 10 votes to zero , with five abstentions , authorizing member states `` to take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack ... while excluding an occupation force . '' 
Libya reacts to no-fly zone U.N. okays no-fly zone over Libya The resolution follows an arms embargo that the Council imposed last month when it unanimously approved sanctions against Libya , freezing the assets of its leaders and referring the ongoing violence against civilian demonstrators to the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- . 
What does the resolution mean ? 
An U.N.-backed international force will enforce a no-fly zone over Libya which will effectively ground Libya 's military aircraft . 
All flights -- except those for humanitarian purposes -- will be banned from Libyan airspace . 
This force will also have the power to launch air strikes against Libyan ground forces -- from tanks , artillery and missiles to their communications and command and control infrastructure -- if they are considered to be a threat against the civilian population . 
According to Barak Seener , Research Fellow in Middle Eastern Studies at the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- in London , the wording in the resolution permitting member states to use `` all necessary means '' also makes pre-emptive strikes from the air at the regime 's forces legitimate . 
`` It 's intended to force Gadhafi back and tilt the balance in the rebel 's favor , '' he told CNN . 
`` I think it will embolden protesters across the Arab world as it is a precedent to oppressive regimes . 
The resolution is saying human rights violations will not go unabated and there will be a response . '' 
Who backed the Security Council vote ? 
Ten of the 15 council members , led by the U.S. and Britain and France , voted in favor of the no-fly zone . 
Who voted for no-fly zone ? 
`` Any decision to put the men and women of our armed services into harms ' way should only ever be taken when it 's absolutely necessary , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement to the country 's parliament after the vote . 
`` But we simply can not stand back and let a dictator whose people have rejected him , kill his people indiscriminately . '' 
China , Russia , Germany , India and Brazil abstained from the Security Council vote citing concerns about a protracted conflict in Libya . 
`` We oppose the use of armed force in international relations and we have serious reservations about some of the content of the resolution , '' said Jiang Yu , a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . 
`` We support the U.N. Secretary-General 's Special Envoy to Libya , African Union and Arab League to resolve this crisis peacefully , '' she said . 
`` We hope that the situation in Libya will return to stability as soon as possible to avoid more serious escalation of armed conflict and humanitarian crisis . '' 
Who will police the no-fly zone ? 
The U.S. and NATO partners have contingencies in place to act within hours , according to an administration official familiar with planning . 
President Barack Obama will insist on a major Arab role in any no-fly zone , the official said . 
Cameron said Britain had started preparations to deploy aircraft , and `` in the coming hours '' they will move to air bases where they will be positioned for any `` necessary action . '' 
French government spokesman Francois Baroin said France plans to participate in what he described as `` swift '' efforts . 
Meanwhile all 39 member states of European Air Traffic organization Eurocontrol , which includes the European Union 's 27 nations as well as Russia , asked the agency to `` ban all flights '' flying over and heading to Libya , a spokeswoman said , in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse . 
We simply can not stand back and let a dictator whose people have rejected him , kill his people indiscriminately . 
Will other Arab countries be involved ? 
The Arab League 's U.N. ambassador , Yahya Mahmassani , said two Arab countries would take part in a no-fly zone operation , but he was not sure which two . 
The Arab League last week called for a no-fly zone following reports of Libyan air attacks on urban areas . 
`` Their involvement will be largely symbolic but extremely important , '' said Seener . 
`` We 're probably looking at involvement from Qatar , UAE and perhaps Saudi Arabia and Egypt . 
`` Autocrats and Islamists can not create a false narrative of western colonialism . 
Rather Gadhafi is deeply unpopular in the Arab world , and the West is fostering a human rights narrative for opposition movements around the Arab world to advance more forcefully . 
It is also ensuring that the trajectory of opposition will go down a human rights path rather than one of resistance in the form of Islamism or radical nationalism . 
`` This also serves as a declaration to authoritarian regimes throughout the region that the West is not an ineffectual foe or paper tiger and will not overlook human rights abuses for the sake of relative short-termed stability . '' 
Is Gadhafi bluffing with the cease-fire ? 
Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa , speaking to reporters Friday in Tripoli , said that in light of its membership in the United Nations , the country is `` obliged to accept the Security Council resolution that permits the use of force to protect the civilian population . '' 
Koussa says Libya was disappointed with the imposition of a no-fly zone , arguing that it will hurt the civilian population . 
He also said the use of military power violates the country 's sovereignty and goes against the U.N. charter , but he acknowledged that some countries may yet intervene . 
However Seener said this was simply a survival tactic by the Gadhafi regime . 
`` It is a tactic to blunt the western response . 
There is no way the regime is willing , in a constructive manner , to engage with the opposition and share power . 
`` They are simply geared towards maximizing their own power and coercing their own people . 
It would be folly to leave the rebels in a vulnerable position . '' 
Who will foot the bill for the fly-zone ? 
Participating countries will have to pay their own costs , said Seener . 
However he added that the U.S. would be doing most of the `` heavy lifting '' in terms its military contribution . 
But with the U.S. and its NATO allies such as Britain heavily involved in Afghanistan , Seener said the issue of military intervention in Libya had been heavily politicized in some countries . 
`` Some sections of press in the UK have said British forces are already over-committed and defense spending needs to be increased , while others say we ca n't engage in Libya because we 're stretched and need to focus on Afghanistan . '' 
He said the reality is Britain does have the capacity to commit to the campaign in Libya without compromising its role in Afghanistan . 
"
2011-03-18,"TRIPOLI | Fri Mar 18 , 2011 7:22 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States accused Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Friday of defying international demands for an immediate ceasefire , hours after President Barack Obama said he faced military action if he did not comply . 
A U.S. National Security official said Gaddafi 's forces were continuing to advance toward the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi , despite a ceasefire announcement by the Libyan government earlier in the day . 
In Benghazi , rebels said they feared an attack by Gaddafi 's forces , while in the western rebel-held city Misrata , residents said they had faced a day of heavy bombing . 
`` All attacks against civilians must stop , '' Obama said , a day after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing international military intervention to protect civilians in Libya . 
Underlining a commitment to provide protection to people across the country -- and not just in the rebel-held east -- Obama also specifically called on Gaddafi 's forces to pull back from the western cities of Zawiyah and Misrata , as well as the eastern town of Ajdabiya : `` Gaddafi must stop his troops from advancing on Benghazi , pull them back from Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zawiyah , and establish water , electricity and gas supplies to all areas . 
Humanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya ... `` Let me be clear , these terms are not negotiable ... If Gaddafi does not comply ... the resolution will be enforced through military action . '' 
His comments were echoed in a statement that Paris issued on behalf of the United States , Britain , France and Arab states . 
GADDAFI TROOPS ADVANCING , OFFICIAL SAYS In Washington , a national security official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the troop movements by Gaddafi 's forces toward Benghazi were `` purposeful '' . 
The assessment was based on official reporting reaching U.S. national security agencies in Washington , he said . 
Asked by CNN whether Gaddafi was in violation of the U.N. resolution , the U.S. envoy to the United Nations , Susan Rice , said : `` Yes , he is . '' 
In Tripoli the government said there had been no bombing since it announced the ceasefire . 
`` We have had no bombardment of any kind since the ceasefire was declared , '' Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told journalists when asked about reports of continued government operations in Misrata and other parts of the country . 
Kaim said Libya was asking China , Germany , Malta and Turkey to send observers to monitor its adherence to the ceasefire . 
A doctor in Misrata contacted by phone in the evening said there had been heavy bombing through the day . 
`` Now they are on the outskirts of the city and I can still hear bombing from time to time , '' he said . 
Rebels in Benghazi dismissed Gaddafi 's ceasefire declaration as a ruse . 
`` He is lying . 
His troops are advancing . 
We do n't believe what Gaddafi says , '' said Mohammed Ishmael al-Tajouri , from the rebel coalition in Benghazi . 
`` When he comes to Benghazi he will be fighting . 
There is no negotiating with Gaddafi . '' 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said everything was ready to launch military strikes in Libya . 
France and Britain have both been strong advocates of military action . 
After embarking on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , the United States had insisted it would participate in rather than lead any military action . 
Obama said the United States would not deploy ground troops in Libya . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It 's their backyard , not ours , and the US has no compelling reason to get involved in a Libyan civil war . 
U.S. Undersecretary of State William Burns said he was concerned Gaddafi , dubbed the ` mad dog of the Middle East ' by president Ronald Reagan in 1986 , could `` return to terrorism and violent extremism '' and create turmoil in the region . 
What he forgets to add is we are throwing out support behind radical Muslims who are known for `` terrorism and violent extremism '' . 
How soon we forget the mistakes of out past . 
Hundreds of thousands of bullets and grenades have been used in the Libyan civil war but less than 500 have found their mark . 
Somebody is not shooting straight or this is a pseudo war whose beneficiaries are the media . 
Without dramatization of reality they would go out of business .

2011-03-18,"BRUSSELS | Fri Mar 18 , 2011 12:45 pm EDT BRUSSELS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Western and Arab military campaign against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi could be launched within hours and cripple his forces -- perhaps drive him from power -- within weeks . 
But it is not without risks . 
Thursday 's U.N. Security Council vote backing military action in Libya offers intervening powers a very broad mandate , by authorizing `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . 
It is unclear how far the allies want to go , notably in view of Gaddafi 's initial response of offering a ceasefire . 
But it is clear their firepower gives them many possibilities . 
Military analysts said the resolution could mean a campaign extending beyond simply preventing government planes operating in a no-fly zone around Benghazi and other rebel-held areas and might be expected to include strikes against air bases , missile sites , command centers , heavy artillery units and tanks . 
They said a coalition led by Britain and France and backed by the United States and Arab countries would be able to deploy formidable air capabilities -- including French Mirage 2000 and Rafale fighters , British Typhoon and Tornado strike aircraft and U.S. F-22s -- against Gaddafi 's fairly ragged resources . 
`` The terms of the resolution are very wide-ranging , '' said Shashank Joshi at London 's Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- , suggesting it could lead to overthrowing Gaddafi . 
`` Over time we may not just see bombing of units close to Benghazi ; we may see powers saying we are authorized to remove this threat . '' 
The air armada would be backed by airborne early-warning and tanker aircraft and British Nimrod spy planes , against a Libyan air force that may be able to field as few as 40 of its notional combat strength of 200-plus aircraft , said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute for Strategic Studies . 
Analysts said the attackers could use a broad range of bases across southern Europe , including in Italy , British bases in Cyprus and Gibraltar and French bases in Corsica and southern France -- as well as , potentially , bases in Gulf states . 
A French official said the operation could also involve missiles fired from warships in the Mediterranean . 
Barak Seener , a Middle East expert at RUSI said the Libyan armed forces would be able to put up little contest : `` I would give it a month , '' he said . 
`` It will be striking targets of the regime and it will be rapidly eroding the regime 's command and control . 
I do n't see this as a time-consuming exercise . '' 
Seener said Western forces , sticking to U.N. instructions not to invade , would seek to turn the war decisively against Gaddafi by aiding the nearly defeated rebels . 
They would supply them with communication equipment , anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems and also send special forces to train their troops . 
`` And they will use the no-fly zone to offer the opposition intelligence on the regime 's movements and force concentrations , '' he said , painting a picture of a decisive intervention on the hitherto losing side in Libya 's civil war . 
Seener said that as well as the Rafale , a multi-purpose strike aircraft , France could use the Super Etendard , a carrier-borne strike fighter supported by VC-10 and C-135 FR refueling tankers and AWACS reconnaissance aircraft . 
He said France would have about 30 carrier-based aircraft available , while the United State had indicated it would only use land-based aircraft . 
These may come from Italy . 
French aircraft could also fly out of land bases in mainland France and Corsica and from Italy , 500-1 ,400 km from Tripoli . 
Britain , meanwhile would employ Tornado GR4s , Typhoons and air-to-air refueling and surveillance aircraft , while Canada is sending six CF-18 Hornets . 
Saudi Arabia , which has Tornados , F-15s and Typhoons , and other Arabs states -- the UAE and Qatar -- would probably provide a token number of aircraft , he said . 
`` The first ground strikes will be carried out by Rafales , Mirage 2000Ds and Tornado GR4s , firing precision weapons -- laser-guided bombs , GPS guided -LRB- A2SM -RRB- and Scalp or Storm Shadow missiles , '' he said . 
`` The bombers will be escorted by fighters to protect them and go after any Libyan planes sent to intercept . '' 
Joshi said that because the rebels lacked the power to topple Gaddafi militarily the allies ' strategy would have to be based on first removing his ability to threaten Benghazi , then a combination of political and military pressure . 
`` The hope will be that there will either be a coup or disintegration of the regime from the top , '' he said . 
While analysts forecast that first strikes against Gaddafi could be launched in the next day or two -- possibly as early as Saturday , when Arab and Western leaders are scheduled to meet in Paris -- some analysts cautioned it could be too late to avoid a messy partition of the country . 
`` It looks like Gaddafi will stay in power in Tripoli for some time to come and a form of stalemate will emerge , bringing a partition between the east and west , '' said Henry Wilkinson of the Janusian Security Consultants . 
Joshi said it was hard to predict how long the campaign would last , but noted that the NATO operation in Kosovo in 1999 , which was forecast to take weeks , had dragged on for months . 
`` There 's no guarantee , '' he said . 
`` Gaddafi could pull back to Sirte and make clear he 's no longer threatening Benghazi and put the coalition in a position of having to decide whether to bomb him there , which could look like a provocative act . 
`` So it could result in stalemate that could go on for months . 
And the longer it goes on the more Arab public opinion will go against it , because you will see creeping civilian casualties , and the more you will see this coalition , which is a very artificial thing , slowly fracture . '' 
Analysts also pointed to the potential costs of a long drawn out campaign , at a time of economic crisis and austerity . 
While an initial air campaign could be launched with `` tens of aircraft , '' Joshi said , it was eventually likely to have to involve hundreds and cost in excess of $ 100 million a week .

2011-03-19,"March 19 , 2011 | By Jason Hanna , CNN The destroyer USS Stout launches a Tomahawk missile toward a target on Libya 's coast on Saturday . 
An international military coalition including France , the United States and Great Britain attacked Libyan air-defense and other military targets Saturday night in an operation that eventually will include enforcing a no-fly zone . 
Libyan rebels had called on international action to help them stave off assaults by Libyan government forces on their positions in Benghazi and other enclaves . 
The coalition 's intervention in Libya 's civil war comes two days after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force , including a no-fly zone , to `` protect civilians and civilian populated areas '' from government attack . 
Here is a look at how the situation got to this point , and what the major players are saying and doing . 
THE START OF THE CONFLICT Libya 's civil war began last month , following protests that coincided with a larger wave of demonstrations in North Africa and the Middle East against governments there . 
In Libya , protesters rallied against , among other things , high unemployment and a delay in a government housing project , and they eventually called for democracy and an end to Moammar Gadhafi 's almost 42-year-long rule . 
Clashes between protesters and security forces began in Benghazi -- Libya 's second-largest city -- on February 16 , and as violence spread to other cities , opposition forces claimed control of Benghazi and other parts of eastern Libya . 
In the ensuing days , the opposition and external governments accused the Libyan regime of atrocities and rights violations , including allegations of a military helicopter firing on a crowd in Benghazi , other military attacks against civilians , arbitrary detentions and summary executions . 
Gadhafi 's regime responded that it was attacking al Qaeda , not civilians . 
GADHAFI 'S FORCES GAIN GROUND AGAINST REBELS At the beginning of March , the Libyan military stepped up efforts to reclaim areas lost to rebels . 
Pro-Gadhafi forces marched eastward , hammering rebel positions in north-central Libya 's Ras Lanuf by the end of last week and moving on to al-Brega and Ajdabiya . 
By the end of this week , Gadhafi 's forces were poised to strike Benghazi . 
ARAB LEAGUE REQUESTS NO-FLY ZONE ; U.N. COMPLIES While the rebels pleaded for help , late last week , the Arab League voted to ask the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to `` protect the civilian population , '' league Secretary General Amre Moussa said . 
"
2011-03-19,"By the CNN Wire Staff France enforcing Libya no-fly zone NEW : Leaders say they will be at the side of Libyan citizens France fires on Libyan military vehicle International leaders warn Gadhafi to stop attacking his own people Sarkozy calls it the `` murderous madness '' of the Libyan regime Paris -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. , European and Arab leaders delivered a strong warning to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Saturday , saying he must stop attacking his own people or else face international military action . 
The warning , announced by French President Nicolas Sarkozy at the end of a last-minute meeting in Paris , came as Sarkozy revealed French fighter jets were already flying over rebel-held areas of Libya to protect the population . 
`` If there is not an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of the forces that have been attacking civilian populations in the last few weeks , our countries will have recourse to military means , '' Sarkozy said , adding that all participants at the meeting endorsed the warning . 
French planes fired on a Libyan military vehicle Saturday evening , according to the French Defense Ministry . 
Cameron : Libya intervention is necessary Libya forces advance on main rebel base France convenes summit on Libya crisis Gadhafi , however , `` has totally ignored this warning , '' Sarkozy said . 
Sarkozy called it the `` murderous madness '' of a regime that has `` forfeited all its legitimacy . '' 
At the same time he spoke , Sarkozy said the French air force is opposing any aggression by Gadhafi 's forces against the population of rebel-held Benghazi . 
`` As of now , our aircraft are preventing planes from attacking the town , '' Sarkozy said . 
`` Other French aircraft are ready to intervene against tanks . '' 
Sarkozy said enforcing the U.N. no-fly zone through military action is not in order to impose a specific outcome -- such as regime change -- but is instead `` in the name of the universal conscience that will not endorse such crimes . '' 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed that idea , saying the purpose of enforcing the U.N. resolution is `` to protect civilians from their own government . '' 
Sarkozy said Gadhafi still has a chance to `` avoid the worst '' if he complies `` immediately and unreservedly '' with the demands of the international community . 
`` The doors of diplomacy will open once again when the aggression stops , '' he said . 
Sarkozy 's comments came at the end of Saturday 's meeting , which included delegations from the United States , Canada , European Union and Britain , along with Iraq , Morocco , the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations . 
In a communique , leaders said they have a long-term commitment in the area . 
`` We assure the Libyan people of our determination to be at their side to help them realize their aspirations and build their future and institutions within a democratic framework , '' the statement said . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron , who was at the meeting in Paris , said participants decided to make Gadhafi face the consequences of his actions . 
`` Colonel Gadhafi has made this happen , '' Cameron told the BBC . 
`` He has lied to the international community . 
He has promised a cease-fire , he has broken that cease-fire , he continues to brutalize his own people , and so the time for action has come . 
It needs to be urgent . '' 
As they met , participants were `` aware of the news reports '' coming out of Libya that show Libyan government forces moving toward Benghazi , a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters . 
`` Time is pressing , '' Herman Van Rompuy , president of the European Council , told the meeting Saturday . 
`` Action is needed now to protect the population . '' 
Clinton said Gadhafi 's forces `` face unambiguous terms '' and that a cease-fire must be implemented immediately . 
`` That means all attacks against civilians must stop , '' she said after the Paris meeting . 
`` Troops must stop advancing on Benghazi and pull back from Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zawiya . 
Water , electricity , and gas supplies must be turned on to all areas . 
Humanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya . '' 
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , another participant at the meeting , proposed the use of the NATO base in Naples as a command center for allied action in Libya , a spokesman for the Italian leader said .

2011-03-19,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libya opposition : Civilian areas shelled Libya says it is not engaging advancing rebel forces Libya invites international observers to visit country Libyan troops must pull back from several cities , Obama says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A fighter jet was shot down and burst into flames Saturday in the area of Benghazi , Libya . 
Explosions could also be heard in the city , which has been a stronghold for rebels opposing Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
It was not immediately clear who the fighter jet belonged to . 
The development is significant , in part , because Benghazi has been considered the center of the opposition forces . 
The opposition has been pushed back from other cities that it used to have control of , and rebels have vowed to defend Benghazi to the death . 
A day earlier , the Libyan government said it was abiding by a cease-fire , but witnesses have said violence from pro-Gadhafi forces have continued . 
Libya late Friday called for international observers to come and verify the cease-fire . 
One day after the approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians , U.S. President Barack Obama warned Gadhafi to pull back from several besieged cities -- or face military consequences . 
But Obama insisted that American troops will not be deployed in Libya . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was flying to Paris for a Saturday meeting with European allies and Arab partners . 
At least 28 people died and hundreds were wounded as fighting raged in the cities of Misrata , Ajdabiya and Zintan on Friday , according to Khaled el-Sayeh , military spokesman for the opposition . 
still hopeful for airstrikes Libya 's deputy foreign minister called for observers from China , Malta , Turkey and Germany `` to come to Libya as soon as possible ... to make sure that there is a real cease-fire on the ground . '' 
Khaled Kaim also noted that the `` door is open for any other countries to send observers . '' 
Kaim said the media is distorting Libyan military actions and said the country has evidence of `` crimes against humanity conducted by the rebels . '' 
Government forces `` did not cause the deaths of any civilians , '' instead inflicting casualties on armed rebel militias , and will not assault Benghazi , Kaim said . 
Forces loyal to Gadhafi are honoring a cease-fire and are not fighting a militia group that is making advances in the eastern part of the country , according to Kaim . 
Rebel forces are advancing on the town of al-Migrun , south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , said Kaim . 
The French press agency AFP confirmed to CNN the movement by a militia group and said it recorded video . 
Witnesses in the western city of Misrata said earlier Friday that a pro-government assault is persisting and casualties are mounting as countries backing the council 's move , such as Britain and France , get their military resources into place to enforce the measure . 
`` What cease-fire ? '' 
asked a doctor in Misrata , who described hours of military poundings , casualties and dwindling resources to treat the wounded . 
`` We 're under the bombs . 
`` This morning , they are burning the city , '' the doctor said . 
`` There are deaths everywhere . '' 
`` Misrata is on fire , '' according to an opposition member , who said tanks and vehicles with heavy artillery shot their way into the city Thursday night and the assault continued Friday . 
He said Gadhafi 's regime announced a cease-fire to buy time for itself . 
`` Please help us . '' 
Outside Ajdabiya in eastern Libya , CNN 's Arwa Damon said she heard explosions , listened to fighters ' accounts of heavy casualties and saw ambulances . 
She said fighters , who do n't trust Gadhafi , believe that the declaration is a trick . 
`` Everybody around us is on very high alert , still expecting the worst , '' Damon said . 
El-Sayeh said 26 people died in Misrata , 83 were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded . 
In Ajdabiya , two died , three were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded . 
There was no immediate casualty count for Zintan , el-Sayeh said . 
CNN could n't independently confirm the witness accounts , and it is impossible to tell whether word of the cease-fire declaration trickled down to pro-government forces . 
Frustration and anger in Benghazi Libyan rebel : We 've seen heavy gunfire No-fly zone a slippery slope to more ? 
In remarks televised around the globe , Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa said in Tripoli that the country decided on `` an immediate cease-fire and the stoppage of all military operations . '' 
He noted that the country , since it is a member of the United Nations , is `` obliged to accept the Security Council resolution that permits the use of force to protect the civilian population . '' 
Obama said Friday that `` left unchecked , we have every reason to believe Gadhafi -LRB- will -RRB- commit atrocities against his own people '' and the surrounding region could be destabilized . 
Power and water must be restored to several cities , he added . 
`` These terms are not negotiable , '' Obama said . 
If Gadhafi does n't comply , the U.N. resolution will be imposed through military action , the president said . 
The U.N. resolution , while not authorizing such a move , does not preclude the United States from arming rebels , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Friday . 
Ambassador Susan Rice told CNN 's `` Situation Room '' that the `` U.S. is ready to act '' and that Gadhafi `` should be under no illusions that if he does n't act immediately he will face swift and sure consequences , including military action . '' 
When asked whether the United States was planning to provide weapons to the opposition , Rice replied , `` We are focused immediately on protection of civilians , on ensuring that the march to Benghazi does not continue and that those who are most vulnerable have the rights and protections that they deserve . '' 
Koussasaid that Libya plans to protect civilians and provide them with humanitarian assistance and that it is obliged to protect all foreigners and their assets . 
He said the Libya government was disappointed in the imposition of a no-fly zone , arguing that it will hurt the civilian population . 
He also said the use of military power would violate the country 's sovereignty and go against the U.N. charter , but he acknowledged that some countries may yet intervene . 
`` There are signs this indeed might take place , '' Koussa said . 
Bernard Valero , a French Foreign Ministry spokesman , said the cease-fire announcement `` does not change the threat on the ground . '' 
`` Gadhafi is privy to folkloric declarations , and we must remain extremely vigilant with regards to these declarations , '' he said . 
Clinton , who called the situation `` fluid and dynamic , '' said the United States wants actions , not words . 
`` We will continue to work with our partners in the international community to press Gadhafi to leave and to support the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people , '' she said . 
The Libyan government `` must immediately cease all hostilities against the civilian population , '' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday in Madrid . 
Earlier Friday , talk emerged in Europe of speedy military action against Gadhafi 's regime . 
In an interview with RTL radio , French government spokesman Francois Baroin said France plans to participate in `` swift '' efforts . 
President Nicolas Sarkozy will convene a summit Saturday to look at the crisis . 
Invited are members of the Arab League , the president of the European Council and representatives of states that support the implementation of the U.N. resolution . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron said the United Kingdom has started preparations to deploy aircraft , and `` in the coming hours '' they will move to air bases where they will be positioned for any `` necessary action . '' 
Spain will offer NATO the use of two military bases and provide air and naval forces for use in operations involving Libya , Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon said Friday in Madrid , a Defense Ministry spokesman said . 
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Canada is sending CF-18 fighter jets to join a Canadian warship on standby off the coast of Libya . 
The Pentagon , meanwhile , announced Friday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates will travel to Russia this weekend as the United States and other nations deliberate action against Libya . 
`` There is no consideration being given to delaying this trip , '' spokesman Geoff Morrell said at the Pentagon . 
He said Gates maintains constant communications links with Washington wherever he goes and can `` carry out his responsibilities no matter where he is in the world . '' 
Asked whether the cease-fire declaration complicates a U.N.-sanctioned intervention , Michael Rubin , a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute , said , `` It is going to make it tougher without a doubt . '' 
`` One should credit Obama for getting the international community behind him , but it came at the price of momentum . 
The Libyans understand European weakness and know how to play off of it , '' Rubin said . 
Rubin said migration concerns come into play , with Europeans worried that more violence will generate more refugees . 
`` They look at change in North Africa almost exclusively through the lens of migration , '' he said . 
The council voted 10-0 with five abstentions Thursday night to authorize `` states to take all necessary measures to protect civilians . '' 
It also imposed a no-fly zone , banning all flights in Libyan airspace , with exceptions that involve humanitarian aid and evacuation of foreign nationals . 
The United States and its NATO partners have severalcontingencies in place to act quickly , according to an administration official familiar with planning . 
They include airstrikes and cruise missile attacks designed to cripple Libyan air defenses and punish the military units that are leading Gadhafi 's push on opposition strongholds in the east , the official said . 
The opposition , with devoted but largely untrained and under-equipped units , has suffered military setbacks this week . 
But their hopes were buoyed by the U.N. vote , particularly in rebel-held Benghazi , where an assault by pro-Gadhafi forces has been expected . 
The resolution singles out the city . 
It says U.N. member states can `` take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force . 
`` The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya '' is a formal name for the nation .

2011-03-19,"Explosions , gunfire heard overnight in Tripoli Gadhafi supporters rally in Tripoli Gadhafi vows to counter `` naked aggression '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Explosions and anti-aircraft fire thundered in the skies above Tripoli early Sunday , but it was not clear whether they resulted from another round of cruise missile attacks by allies determined to stop Moammar Gadhafi 's offensive against Libyan opposition forces . 
CNN 's Nic Robertson witnessed the development a few hours after nearly 1,000 people gathered at Gadhafi 's palace in the capital . 
The crowd chanted , waved flags and shot off fireworks in support of the government . 
A defiant Gadhafi said Libya will fight back against undeserved `` naked aggression . '' 
His military claimed nearly 50 people , including , women , children and clerics , were killed in Saturday evening 's attacks . 
There was no independent confirmation of that statement . 
American , French and British military forces , convinced that Gadhafi was not adhering to a United Nations-mandated cease-fire , hammered Libyan military positions with missiles and fighter jets in the first phase of an operation that will include enforcement of a no-fly zone . 
Gadhafi responds to air strikes Gallery : Civil war in Libya An eyewitness in Tripoli reported seeing signs of gunfire rising Sunday morning from the direction of nearby Mitiga Airport . 
The anti-Gadhafi activist said she heard `` continuous gunshots '' and at least two loud explosions . 
It was not clear if the airport was also being used as a military installation . 
The eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said she did not hear the sound of flying aircraft . 
More than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired from American and British ships and submarines hit about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets in western portions of the country , U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing . 
The U.S. will conduct a damage assessment of the sites , which include SA-5 missiles and communications facilities . 
A senior U.S. military official , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the cruise missiles , which fly close to the ground or sea at about 550 miles per hour , landed near Misrata and Tripoli . 
The salvo , in an operation dubbed `` Odyssey Dawn , '' was meant `` to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people , '' said Gortney . 
U.S. Navy photos showed flashes of light and smoke funnels as missiles soared from a destroyer into the night sky . 
Earlier , French fighter jets deployed over Libya fired at a military vehicle Saturday , the first strike against Gadhafi 's military forces , which earlier attacked the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
Prime Minister David Cameron said late Saturday that British forces also are in action over Libya . 
`` What we are doing is necessary , it is legal and it is right , '' he said . 
`` I believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people . '' 
British Defense Secretary Liam Fox said the Royal Air Force deployed Tornado GR4 fast jets , which flew 3,000 miles from the United Kingdom and back , `` making this the longest-range bombing mission conducted by the RAF since the -LRB- 1982 -RRB- Falklands conflict . '' 
While there were no U.S. warplanes flying over Libya late Saturday , the coalition was softening Libyan positions before enforcing a no-fly zone , Gortney said . 
The Libyan military , in a statement broadcast on state TV , said , `` An enemy attacked the state on March 19th with rockets ... Those enemies killed 48 martyrs -- mostly women , children , and religious clerics . 
They left more than 150 injured . 
The majority of these attacks were on public areas , hospitals and schools . 
They frightened the children and women near those areas that were subject to this aggression . '' 
Libya forces advance on main rebel base Gadhafi , speaking early Sunday on Libyan state TV , said the U.N. charter provides for Libya 's right to defend itself in a `` war zone . '' 
Weapons depots will be opened , he said . 
`` All you people of the Islamic nations and Africa , and Latin America and Asia , stand with the Libyan people in its fight against this aggression , '' Gadhafi said . 
Air attacks on several locations in Tripoli and Misrata have caused `` real harm '' to civilians , a Libyan government spokesman said . 
An eyewitness in Misrata said Gadhafi 's forces are targeting fuel and power stations in an effort to make citizens believe the damage is being done by coalition forces . 
The eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said people celebrated allied airstrikes on loyalist positions in the city . 
CNN could not verify the account . 
Shortly after the first missile attacks , U.S. President Barack Obama informed the American people of the efforts by a `` broad coalition . '' 
`` The use of force is not our first choice , '' the president said from Brasilia , Brazil . 
`` It is not a choice I make lightly . 
But we can not stand idly by when a tyrant tells his own people that there will be no mercy . '' 
Obama is planning for the U.S. portion of the military action in Libya to only last for a few days , according to a senior administration official , who was not authorized to speak about sensitive military matters . 
`` After that we 'll take more of a supporting role , '' the senior official said . 
Obama authorized U.S. military force from Brazil on what happened to be the eighth anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq . 
Coalition partners say Gadhafi has failed to adhere to a United Nations resolution that imposed the no-fly zone and ordered him to stop attacks on civilians . 
`` He 's clearly been on the offensive , '' the senior U.S. military official said of Gadhafi . 
`` He said that he was going to do a cease-fire and he continued to move his forces into Benghazi . '' 
Earlier Saturday , Gadhafi issued defiant messages to international powers . 
`` I have all the Libyan people with me and I 'm prepared to die . 
And they are prepared to die for me . 
Men , women and even children , '' Gadhafi said in a letter addressed to Obama and read to reporters by a government spokesman in Tripoli . 
Obama , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gortney used the term `` unique capabilities '' to describe the U.S. part of the effort . 
Officials have said American military forces are meant to augment Arab , European and other Western troops . 
In the next few days , U.S. military officials expect to hand over control to a coalition commander . 
Canada and Italy also are part of the coalition . 
`` Our air force will oppose any aggression by Colonel Gadhafi against the population of Benghazi , '' said French President Nicolas Sarkozy , speaking after a top-level meeting in Paris over the Libyan crisis . 
The international meeting -- which included Western and Arab partners -- focused on how to take on a Libyan government bent on destroying the fledgling opposition movement under the U.N. resolution authorizing force to protect civilians against the Gadhafi government . 
Rebel forces in Benghazi used a captured army tank as a victory symbol , CNN 's Arwa Damon reported . 
Earlier Saturday , incoming artillery rounds landed inside Benghazi , and pro-Gadhafi tanks rolled into the town firing rounds , witnesses said . 
A flaming fighter jet plummeted from the sky , nose-diving to the ground . 
Khaled el-Sayeh , the opposition military spokesman , said the plane was an old MiG-23 that belonged to the rebels . 
As night fell over Benghazi on Saturday , the city became quiet and calm . 
While plumes of smoke could be spotted , the pro-Gadhafi tanks seen earlier were not in sight . 
El-Sayeh told CNN that `` tens '' had been killed in Benghazi on Saturday . 
He said Gadhafi forces had withdrawn from the city and that they were positioned 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- outside Benghazi . 
CNN could not independently verify those details . 
Gadhafi -- in a separate letter addressed to Sarkozy , Cameron and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- called the U.N. moves `` invalid '' because the resolution does not permit intervention in the internal affairs of other countries . 
Violence has raged in Libya following protests calling for democracy and freedom and demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year-long rule . 
It 's a conflict spurred by anti-government protest and resulting regime violence against civilians -- which the U.N. resolution cites as `` outrageous '' and Sarkozy calls `` murderous madness . ''

S. Navy photo\/Handout By Maria Golovnina and Michael Georgy TRIPOLI | Sat Mar 19 , 2011 7:34 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Western forces hit targets along the Libyan coast on Saturday , using strikes from air and sea to force Muammar Gaddafi 's troops to cease fire and end attacks on civilians . 
French planes fired the first shots in what is the biggest international military intervention in the Arab world since the 2003 invasion of Iraq , destroying tanks and armored vehicles in the region of the rebels ' eastern stronghold , Benghazi . 
Hours later , U.S. and British warships and submarines launched 110 Tomahawk missiles against air defenses around the capital Tripoli and the western city of Misrata , which has been besieged by Gaddafi 's forces , U.S. military officials said . 
They said U.S. forces and planes were working with Britain , France , Canada and Italy in operation `` Odyssey Dawn '' . 
Gaddafi called it `` colonial , crusader '' aggression . 
`` It is now necessary to open the stores and arm all the masses with all types of weapons to defend the independence , unity and honor of Libya , '' he said in an audio message broadcast on state television hours after the strikes began . 
State television said the `` crusader enemy '' hit civilian areas of Tripoli and fuel storage tanks that supplied Misrata . 
Residents in Misrata said air strikes had targeted a military airbase where Gaddafi loyalists were based . 
Several Tripoli residents said they heard an explosion near the eastern Tajoura district . 
`` I heard an explosion . 
I saw a flash , it was a very strong explosion , '' said one . 
In Benghazi , where earlier on Saturday rebels said they had beaten back an advance by Gaddafi 's troops , residents welcomed the military intervention but were also apprehensive . 
`` We think this will end Gaddafi 's rule . 
Libyans will never forget France 's stand with them . 
If it were n't for them , then Benghazi would have been overrun tonight , '' said Iyad Ali , 37 . 
`` We salute , France , Britain , the United States and the Arab countries for standing with Libya . 
But we think Gaddafi will take out his anger on civilians . 
So the West has to hit him hard , '' said Khalid al-Ghurfaly , a civil servant , 38 . 
Earlier on Saturday , leaders meeting in Paris announced the start of military intervention after Gaddafi 's troops pushed into the outskirts of Benghazi in spite of a U.N. resolution passed on Thursday calling for an end to attacks on civilians . 
`` Those taking part agreed to put in place all necessary means , especially military , to enforce the decisions of the United Nations Security Council , '' French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after the meeting of Western and Arab leaders . 
`` Colonel Gaddafi has made this happen , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters after the meeting . 
`` We can not allow the slaughter of civilians to continue . '' 
Some analysts have questioned the strategy for the military intervention , fearing western forces might be sucked into a long civil war despite a U.S. insistence -- repeated on Saturday -- that it has no plans to send ground troops into Libya . 
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper suggested that outside powers hoped their intervention would be enough to turn the tide against Gaddafi and allow Libyans to force him out . 
`` It is our belief that if Mr. Gaddafi loses the capacity to enforce his will through vastly superior armed forces , he simply will not be able to sustain his grip on the country . '' 
A U.S. military slide showed some 25 coalition ships , including three U.S. submarines armed with Tomahawk missiles , are stationed in the Mediterranean . 
The Libyan government has blamed rebels , who it says belong to al Qaeda , for breaking a ceasefire it announced on Friday . 
In Tripoli , several thousand people gathered at the Bab al-Aziziyah palace , Gaddafi 's compound that was bombed by U.S. warplanes in 1986 , to show their support . 
`` There are 5,000 tribesmen that are preparing to come here to fight with our leader . 
They better not try to attack our country , '' said farmer Mahmoud el-Mansouri . 
`` We will open up Libya 's deserts and allow Africans to flood to Europe to blow themselves up as suicide bombers . '' 
U.S. SAYS NOT LEADING INTERVENTION France and Britain have taken a lead role in pushing for international intervention in Libya and the United States -- after embarking on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- has been at pains to stress it is supporting , not leading , the operation . 
In announcing the missile strikes , which came eight years to the day after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq , Obama said the effort was intended to protect the Libyan people . 
`` Today I authorized the armed forces of the United States to begin a limited action in Libya in support of an international effort to protect Libyan civilians , '' Obama told reporters in Brasilia , where he had begun a five-day tour of Latin America . 
He said U.S. troops were acting in support of allies , who would lead the enforcement of a no-fly zone to stop Gaddafi 's attacks on rebels . 
`` As I said yesterday , we will not , I repeat , we will not deploy any U.S. troops on the ground , '' Obama said . 
But despite Washington 's determination to stress the limits of its role , Vice Admiral Bill Gortney , director of the U.S. military 's Joint Staff , said the missile strikes were only the first phase of a multiphase action . 
Many analysts do not think Western powers would be satisfied with a de facto partition which left the rebels in control in the east and Gaddafi running a rump state in the west . 
One participant at the Paris meeting said that Clinton and others had stressed Libya should not be split in two . 
And Obama on Friday specifically called on Gaddafi 's forces to pull back from the western cities of Zawiyah and Misrata as well from the east . 
But security analysts have questioned what western powers will do if Gaddafi digs in . 
`` It 's going to be far less straightforward if Gaddafi starts to move troops into the cities which is what he has been trying to do for the past 24 hours , '' said Marko Papic at the STRATFOR global intelligence group . 
`` Once he does that it becomes a little bit more of an urban combat environment and at that point it 's going to be difficult to use air power from 15,000 feet to neutralize that . '' 
Earlier on Saturday hundreds of cars full of refugees fled Benghazi toward the Egyptian border after the city came under a bombardment overnight . 
One family of 13 women from a grandmother to small children , rested at a roadside hotel . 
`` I 'm here because when the bombing started last night my children were vomiting from fear , '' said one of them , a doctor . 
`` All I want to do is get my family to a safe place and then get back to Benghazi to help . 
My husband is still there . '' 
Those who remained set up make-shift barricades with furniture , benches , road signs and even a barbecue in one case at intervals along main streets . 
Each barricade was manned by half a dozen rebels , but only about half of those were armed . 
In the besieged western city of Misrata , residents said government forces shelled the rebel town again early on Saturday , while water supplies had been cut off for a third day . 
`` I am telling you , we are scared and we are alone '' , a Misrata resident , called Saadoun , told Reuters by telephone .

For once , Obama acted the way we all hoped he would act . 
With reason , sane , and decidedly , but in way to prevent war or destruction with war action as much as possible . 
It will obviously be in Gaddafi 's interest not to contravene the no-fly order because he stands to loose his fleet and anti-aircraft defenses . 
Ironically , that he entire struggle of the tow opposing sides has to be stopped now and that it will need diplomacy to find a way that includes all sides ' necessities , results in the negotiations which Venezuelan president Chavez suggested .

Ten years from now , based on history , we will be asking -- again -- how long this expensive fight will last . 
Meanwhile , the first 110 American cruise missiles , probably worth a couple of hundred million dollars , have been launched as just the first phase of the attack to end the Libyan civil war , under the guise of protecting what many people are probably calling our side , even though it is essentiall y a war between tribes whose civilian population s are aligned along tribal lines rather than being democratic freedom fighters as the West likes to call them . 
However , one can hope this civil war will end sooner than appears likely .

2011-03-20,"Republican senator says military mission should oust Gadhafi U.S. to hand over leadership of mission in coming days Coalition forces took out most of Libya 's air defense systems , Mullen says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S.-led military mission in Libya has effectively imposed a no-fly zone and blasted some of Moammar Gadhafi 's ground forces outside the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said Sunday . 
The coalition forces , including U.S. , British and French aircraft , have taken out most of Libya 's air defense systems and some airfields , Mullen said in interviews on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program and other networks . 
In addition , Libyan ground forces in the vicinity of Benghazi were hit in an effort to prevent attacks on lesser-armed rebel fighters and civilians , said Mullen , who called the start of the mission a success . 
`` I would say the no-fly zone is effectively in place , '' Mullen told CNN , adding that the strategy now is to cut off logistical support for Gadhafi 's forces that are `` pretty spread out '' from Tripoli to Benghazi . 
Mullen also said Gadhafi 's forces had shown little ability to take on the coalition firepower so far , and he made clear that the scope of the mission was limited , involving creation of the no-fly zone , stopping attacks on civilians and allowing humanitarian operations to proceed . 
He acknowledged on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that the military mission could be completed with Gadhafi still in power . 
Fighter jets hit Libyan army convoy Action taken to stop Gadhafi Obama : No ground troops in Libya `` He 's a thug , he 's a cagey guy , he 's a survivor . 
We know that , '' Mullen said of Gadhafi on the CBS program `` Face the Nation , '' noting that the Libyan leader has access to large quantities of mustard gas that concern the United States . 
`` It 's something he could do a lot of damage with , '' Mullen said , adding that coalition forces were closely monitoring the situation and , so far , `` have n't seen him move in that direction . '' 
U.S. President Barack Obama had been under mounting pressure from Republican critics and some Democrats to take steps against Gadhafi . 
On Sunday 's talk shows , all U.S. politicians interviewed welcomed the new military mission , but some worried it was too late or too limited to do the necessary job of taking out Gadhafi . 
`` Isolate , strangle and replace this man -- that should be our goal , '' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told `` FOX News Sunday . '' 
In particular , Graham took issue with Obama 's insistence on getting a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the mission as well as Arab League endorsement as a strategy to prevent accusations of a U.S. vendetta against the Islamic world . 
`` I think the president ` caveated ' this way too much , it 's almost like it 's a nuisance , '' Graham said . 
`` This is a great opportunity to replace a tyrannical dictator who is not a legitimate leader , who is an international crook . 
And we should seize the moment and talk about replacing him , not talking about how limited we will be . '' 
However , Mullen and Democrats said gaining international consensus for the mission was crucial , and Mullen made clear that the U.S. role would be limited , telling NBC that `` we 're not going to put any boots on the ground . 
This is n't about occupation in any shape or form . '' 
Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island told reporters that the best outcome `` would be for Gadhafi and his family to recognize that they are illegitimate rulers of the country and to depart the scene , allowing the United Nations , politically , to organize a popular referendum or some democratic means to establish a new government . '' 
`` If Gadhafi chooses not to go , then , I think , there will be a longer period of conflict , '' Reed said . 
`` But I just sense that given this incredible unified opposition to him , particularly the Arab League , that the signal has to be clear that his days are numbered . '' 
For now , Mullen told CNN , `` we would like to see him withdraw his forces across the country back into garrison '' and stop attacking his people . 
When told that Gadhafi was claiming women and children had been killed in the coalition air strikes , Mullen said on CNN that the targets were selected carefully , adding : `` I 've seen no reports of significant civilian casualties . '' 
On other networks , he said he was unaware of any civilian casualties so far . 
As part of the no-fly zone , coalition combat aircraft will be patrolling over Benghazi at all times , Mullen told CNN . 
Coalition forces also are looking to jam communications of Gadhafi 's forces in what Mullen called the `` first phase of a multifaceted '' operation . 
`` While we 're leading it now , we 're looking to hand off that leadership in the next few days , '' Mullen said on NBC . 
On the same show , Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , the chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said Britain , France and Arab nations would assume control of the mission . 
Mullen said he expected Arab countries that supported the mission to begin contributing military help . 
On Sunday , the French Defense Ministry announced that Qatar has offered to contribute four fighter planes to the coalition effort . 
House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , issued a statement Sunday calling for Obama to provide more explanation on the military mission . 
`` Before any further military commitments are made , the administration must do a better job of communicating to the American people and to Congress about our mission in Libya and how it will be achieved , '' Boehner 's statement said . 
To Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona , Obama waited too long to take action in Libya . 
`` We need now to support him and the efforts that our military are going to make , '' McCain told CNN in an interview taped Friday and broadcast Sunday . 
`` And I regret that it did n't -- we did n't act much more quickly , and we could have . '' 
McCain , the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said if the United States had acted a few weeks ago , a no-fly zone `` would probably have been enough '' to prevent the situation in the African country from deteriorating . 
Even so , he said , time is now against Gadhafi . 
`` If he -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- does n't succeed in a relatively short period of time , he 'll be driven back and , over time , I believe , defeated , '' McCain said . 
`` I have great confidence in our capabilities that the most mightiest nation in the world is now matched up against a third-rate or fourth-rate power . '' 
Asked if the United States waited too long , Mullen answered that it was impossible to say what might have changed if there had been earlier U.S. action . 
He emphasized the importance of gaining international consensus and assistance for the military mission launched almost exactly on the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , saying : `` This was n't something the United States ginned up . ''

2011-03-20,"2 men charged in death of Chicago teen who performed in inauguration event . 
It was a stark , raw tweet from Ben Wedeman with a big impact on our newsroom Saturday morning . 
One of our first and most-trusted sources of information on the conflict in Libya had become a victim of the very civil war he in some ways had helped to spark . 
In the first few days of the conflict back in February , `` Mo '' as we called him had become an inspiration , friend and `` go-to '' source as well as a regular witness on CNN 's shows . 
Of course , you would n't know that from watching . 
We blurred his face and gave him code-names like `` Benghazi Protester '' in order to protect him and his young family . 
It was a struggle to keep him from blurting out his name and even phone number on air , sometimes , as Mohammed said that he wanted freedom for Libya , or to be martyred trying to achieve it . 
`` I am not afraid to die , I am afraid to lose the battle , '' the young , western-educated software engineer would tell us when we asked him to keep his identity secret . 
Libya before the fighting started was one of those very few `` black holes '' on the world 's map for us : like North Korea or Syria , it was a country where the regimes iron grip on information was so strong and the secret police so brutal and pervasive that the risk of contacting people was simply not justified for putting peoples lives at risk by staying in regular communication . 
When that all began to crumble beginning on February 17th and Libyans in the country 's east began to rise up , we had to develop webs of witnesses from scrap . 
But one quickly became our most savvy source : a 27-year-old technology expert and former internet provider in Benghazi . 
Mohammed and other supporters had set up a kind of protest command center in the city 's courthouse after ejecting Ghadhafi 's forces in the first days of fighting . 
That 's where we first contacted him on February 18th - a guy who looked more Silicon Valley in a hooded sweatshirt and big headphones than a partisan in a Libyan war zone . 
Amazingly , Mohammed had beaten the regimes firewalls and jerry-rigged a live signal from the building . 
The camera showed the few hundred protesters huddled outside against the walls due to the cold and whipping winds - worried that Gadhafi 's forces could swoop in at any moment . 
It was our first view of the protests there , and we were worried that all this would be traced back and used to target the band of students and young people defying the Gadhafi regime . 
At first Mo just wanted to get that picture to us , as he felt that it provided a thin blanket of security . 
He thought Ghadhafi might hold back if he knew that ordering the army or his feared African mercenaries to slaughter the protesters would be seen on live television around the globe . 
Mohammed pushed the technical know-how limits of our engineers and desk editors such as Yousuf Basil , Jack Maddox , Ben Brumfield and myself as he came up with elaborate ways to get more and more cameras going around the courthouse . 
But it was n't until we started interviewing him on air that we realized how special he was . 
Mohammed poignantly told us about how the army had shot into the crowds , then using armored vehicles to roll over protesters after they had run out of ammunition , and how the demonstrators would not give up . 
After the first two days he told us with his live stream and webcasts he had become some sort of leader . 
`` People have been calling my mobile non-stop . 
I woke up today with 125 missed calls . 
People have been calling and checking on me to see if I am safe . 
One person called from Serbia just to say they are thinking of me and my struggle . '' 
Chillingly , the newly married man with his first baby just a month from being born told us he believed the government knew who he was and there would be a price to be paid for his boldness . 
`` I would love to wake up tomorrow and people not be dead . 
But I know 200 people will be dead , '' he told one of our desk editors , Mitra Mobasherat . 
`` Libyans lives to Gaddafi are very cheap . '' 
Our correspondents in the field eventually caught up with Mohammed as CNN teams like Ben Wedeman and Mary Rogers led the push to get into the rebel territory , with Arwa Damon featuring him in one gripping package . 
Later , as the rebel lines advanced toward Tripoli , we were in contact with him less often , but he expanded his presence and contact with the rest of the world . 
Along with his supporters he developed social media sites like Feb17 . 
info , set up an independent internet TV signal `` Libya al-Hurrah '' and conducted interviews with dozens of broadcasters . 
And as the conflict surged back toward Benghazi in recent days he began to go out into the field to interview people about the dangers and loss they were suffering from the ongoing struggle . 
That 's what he was doing Friday when he was fatally shot . 
Reports are still sketchy , but his wife and supporters say he was killed by a headshot from a sniper while going out to videotape rocket attacks on one neighborhood where he heard several children had been killed . 
He phoned in one last report that morning to al-Hurrah , with the sounds of heavy machine gun fire rattling and artillery exploding around him . 
Then , nothing else until Ben 's tweet , and the following announcement he had been killed after the fighting . 
info was one final favorite quote of Mohammed Nabbous : `` A Candle loses nothing by lighting another Candle . ''

2011-03-20,"From Elise Labott , CNN Senior State Department Producer Initially , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was skeptical of the U.S. joining a military coalition . 
Arab League statement `` changed the landscape '' Secretary of state pressed UAE for support Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama 's decision to undertake military action in Libya to enforce a no-fly zone was the product of an administration debate with unlikely bedfellows . 
Initially , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was skeptical of the U.S. joining a military coalition . 
But senior U.S. officials said advances last weekend made by forces loyal to Gadhafi in retaking rebel strongholds in the east , which opened up the possibility of thousands more being killed , convinced her action was necessary . 
Additionally , a statement by the Arab League calling for the United Nations to enforce a no-fly zone , Clinton told reporters Saturday , `` changed the diplomatic landscape . '' 
As Britain and France pushed for a quick U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing a no-fly zone , officials said Clinton teamed up with Susan Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , in creating the conditions for a resolution with the broadest possible authority and the largest international support . 
Clinton made the case that U.S. support for a no-fly zone was conditioned on Arab participation and leadership . 
In Paris , Clinton met with her counterparts in town for a meeting of the Group of 8 foreign ministers and with Abdullah bin Zayed , the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates . 
Even as she criticized the UAE for its recent decision to send forces to quell a rebellion in Bahrain , Clinton pressed him to send planes to Libya . 
As Clinton traveled to Cairo and Tunisia seeking Arab buy-in for the resolution , officials said Rice built support in New York for the resolution . 
Samantha Power , an adviser to Obama on the National Security Council and a human rights activist , was also urging the president to intervene . 
Clinton 's alliance with Rice and Power in pushing for intervention put her at odds with Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who had publicly argued against a no-fly zone . 
Sources said Vice President Joe Biden was also more cautious , arguing for the smallest possible U.S. involvement in any military action . 
A senior administration official said that `` like the president , the vice president wanted any action taken with a broad international coalition . '' 
The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military planning , said when the vice president `` saw that was achievable , he supported the policy to seek the military intervention . '' 
After meeting with Amr Moussa , secretary general of the Arab League , in Cairo Tuesday night , officials said Clinton called Obama , telling him the Arabs were willing to take part in the no-fly zone . 
That participation , officials said , was critical for the administration , which was concerned about the perception of invading a third Arab country . 
`` In order for us to go along , it was important for the Arabs to have some skin in the game , '' one senior official said .

A total of 159 Tomahawks have been fired by the United States and the United Kingdom since an international coalition started Operation Odyssey Dawn on Saturday . 
Cmdr. Monica Rousselow , a spokeswoman for the task force , also said one of the three U.S. submarines that participated at the beginning of the operation has since departed the area . 
She declined to say which submarine . 
-LRB- 8:59 p.m. Monday ET , 2:59 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- In a rare public spat , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev criticized his political mentor , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , for Putin 's comments over the use of force against Libya . 
Putin on Monday said the U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing a no-fly zone over Libya was `` obviously incomplete and flawed . '' 
He added that it `` resembles a medieval appeal for a crusade in which somebody calls upon somebody to go to a certain place and liberate it . '' 
A few hours later Medvedev weighed in , scolding Putin 's comments , without using the prime minister 's name . 
`` It is absolutely inexcusable to use expressions that , in effect , lead to a clash of civilizations - such as ` crusades , ' and so on . 
That is unacceptable , '' Medvedev said . 
-LRB- 8:10 p.m. Monday ET , 2:10 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- CNN correspondent Nic Robertson has rejected a Fox News report that he and other journalists were used as human shields by the Libyan government to prevent a missile attack on Gadhafi 's compound . 
Libyan government officials brought CNN and other news crews to the compound to view a building that was damaged late Sunday in a coalition air strike . 
The Fox story , posted on the outlet 's website Monday , says the journalists ' presence forced a British aircraft to call off firing seven missiles at the area that already had been hit . 
Robertson , who was part of the CNN crew cited in the Fox story , called the rival network 's report `` outrageous and hypocritical . '' 
Robertson said a Fox staffer was among the journalists on the trip - which was not mentioned in the Fox report - and that the journalists in the group were hurried through their trip by their minders . 
`` If they wanted to use us as human shields ... they would have kept us there longer , '' Robertson said . 
`` That 's not what happened . ''

`` We 're not coordinating with the rebels . 
Are we going to leave them surrounded , and with the mercy of Gadhafi ? 
I 've never seen anything so confused in my life , '' Norton told CNN . 
On the right , lawmakers are demanding the president better explain the U.S. mission in Libya to Congress and the American people , CNN 's Dana Bash reports . 
`` The president should come home and call the Congress back into session and to make his case .

Still , Obama noted : `` I also have stated that it is U.S. policy that Gadhafi needs to go . '' 
Obama said he 's still hopeful that other `` tools '' the administration has used , such as freezing billions in Libyan assets , will eventually help the Libyan people push Gadhafi out .

In an interview set to air Monday on CNN 's `` John King , USA , '' Lugar , the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said the operation has not been clearly defined . 
`` I do not understand the mission because as far as I can tell in the United States there is no mission and there are no guidelines for success , '' Lugar , R-Indiana , told CNN 's John King . 
`` That may well be true with our allies although conceivably they may have other missions in mind and simply try to get Security Council clearance to proceed . ''

Rep. Dennis Kucinich , the seven-term liberal Democrat from Ohio who has twice run for the White House , says Obama committed an `` impeachable offense '' in deciding to authorize U.S. airstrikes over Libya Saturday without the consent of Congress . 
`` President Obama moved forward without Congress approving . 
He did n't have Congressional authorization , he has gone against the Constitution , and that 's got to be said , '' Kucinich told the web site Raw Story on Monday .

`` We anticipate this transition to take place in a matter of days , not weeks , '' Obama said . 
-LRB- 2:58 p.m. Monday ET , 8:58 p.m. Monday in Libya -RRB- U.S. President Barack Obama , addressing the situation in Libya during a trip to Chile , said that `` it is U.S. policy '' that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi `` has to go . '' 
Obama said the core principle of the military mission is that the international community `` ca n't stand by with empty words '' in the face of an imminent humanitarian catastrophe such as a leader using military force against his own people .

Spokesman Khawla Mattar said Ban was `` fine '' and `` it was not a serious incident . '' 
`` They were not chanting anti-UN slogans .

`` There is no information of killed civilians recorded by the French command , '' French government spokesman Francois Baroin said on the French TV channel Canal + Monday . 
Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi 's regime claimed that dozens of people - mostly women , children and clerics - have been killed in the international airstrikes that started Saturday . 
`` We must be cautious of communication campaigns and propaganda . 
... This is a military operation and a communications campaign battle , '' Baroin said . 
`` We have to trust what the international community is communicating . '' 
-LRB- 2:14 a.m. Monday ET , 8:14 a.m. Monday in Libya -RRB- U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said it would be `` unwise '' to set specific goals about targeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi directly during attacks . 
`` I think that it 's important that we operate within the mandate of the U.N. Security Council resolution , '' Gates told reporters Sunday while on a plane to Russia . 
`` If we start adding additional objectives , then I think we create a problem in that respect . 
I also think that it is unwise to set as specific goals , things that you may or may not be able to achieve . '' 
The Security Council resolution , which passed Thursday , allows member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country ... while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory , '' according to the United Nations . 
-LRB- 12:34 a.m. Monday ET , 6:34 a.m. Monday in Libya -RRB- A coalition military official has confirmed that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's compound was targeted by airstrikes Sunday night .

Earlier , Western journalists , including CNN 's Nic Robertson , were brought inside the compound to survey the destruction . 
-LRB- 10:51 p.m. Sunday ET , 4:51 a.m. Monday in Libya -RRB- An announced list of the countries participating in the military coalition : The United States , Belgium , Britain , Canada , Denmark , France , Italy , Norway , Qatar and Spain . 
U.S. officials have said they plan to hand over operational control of the military mission in coming days . 
WE need to remember it is not the UN 's job to get Ghaddafi out , they do n't have any authority to do this it is the job of the UN to keep him from killing his own people . 
I know everyone is up in arms about us being in conflict with another arab country but this was a unanimous vote to help keep the civilians of Libya safe from their evil leader . 
And if this ever happens in your country , where ever you are from , I hope the UN steps in to help you too . 
Because I know that the US and its allies will , because it 's their job . 
Civil wars happen all the time and does n't usually need interventions from other countries until unarmed civilians are getting set up to be wiped out from the govt . 
IF UN WANTS TO FREE LIBYAN PEOPLE FROM THE ATROCITIES AND TYRANNICAL RULE OF COL. GADHAFI , STRIKING ALLIANCE SHOULD DEVICE SUCH A PLAN THAT EITHER ONLY GADHAFI IS CAPTURED OR DIRECTLY ATTACHED . 
IT SOUNDS INHUMAN BUT TO MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE , CIVILIAN 'S DEATHS AND SHORTEN THE WAR PERIOD , THIS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION IN SIGHT . 
BUT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN SUCH A TACTICAL WAT THAT IT SHOULD SEEM TO BE A PART OF WAR AND NOT PERSONAL ATTACH . 
AND THEREAFTER UN SHOULD CONDUCT FREE AND FARE DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF INDIA ALSO AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND HAND OVER THE REIGNS OF POWER TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND ALSO TAKE BACK THE MILITARY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF LIBYAN PEOPLE AS WELL AS TO AVOID ANY MISCONCEPTION OR MISINTERPRETATION BEHIND THE ATTACH BY OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES .

High horse Congressmen criticizing Obama 's decision to participate in the `` no fly zone '' over Libya . 
If he were a Republican , the Republican congressmen would n't be so critical . 
If he were n't so decisive as a commander in chief , the democrat congressmen would n't be complaining either ! 
Sorry folks , but we have one commander in chief and he has been very clear about his intentions all along . 
At least he is n't unilaterally taking on Libya -LRB- as our former president would have done -RRB- , but is acting on a United Nations resolution . 
I say he 's doing it right . 
So step back out of the lime light congressmen , and let the man do his job ! 
You can whine later about not being president yourself ! 
Im ALL for the U.S. in Libya even if it means ground forces , we should be helping people who are fighting for their Freedoms and preventing mass slaughters ! 
As for the ones in congress trying to ride on the popularity of fears of War and such , they are an embarrassment and hope they are voted out !! If Yeman needs helps so be it , I for one think we need to do something about Somalia , Clinton was right going in there but this time we should wipe it off the map !! This attack on Libya was planned out well and it shows how Smart our President is , I like that ! 
As for Iraq and Afghanastan all were very poorly planning which prolonged our objective . 
When you send in ground forces , you do not go in with a limited amount . 
If we would have flooded Iraq with ground foreces and Tanks it would have been over fast , same goes for Afghanastan . 
We want a Free World and a better world for our children , then we need to do what we can to rid it of terrorist and dictators who are a world threat . 
Libya 's Leader was nothing but a Terrorist . 
Then we have Korea whose leader is so unstable he could be the one to start a Nuclear War . 
We have to take these kind of leaders out , hiding under a rock and playing nice and flapping our lips will not take away the Problem !! One thing President Bush was right about , he said once Freedoms in the Middle East is establishest and leaders like Sadam is taken out , Freedom will spread , well , look whats happening now , there fighting for their Freedome , whats wrong with backing that ?? Your news cover is wrong . 
The plane shot down is a F-15E model . 
I have confirmed this by the photo description that it is infect this plane . 
I have studied the plane and have looked on several news sights such as BBC . 
Please review the statement made on CNN that the plane was a F-16 . 
Obama is hiding while caddafi lives up to his promise searching house to house to kill domonstrators in masarata . 
When you look at the countries involved in the Lybian war and you compare it in the 18th century with Napolean it is north surprising . 
The Western world like a olt of uglyness The Western World is constantly talking about terrorist attack . 
Who was responsible for bombing Martin Luther 's house in the United States , for sure it was not the Lybian leader nor Saddam .

2011-03-20,"CNN Student News - 3\/21\/11 Download PDF maps related to today 's show : THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . 
CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Military action is underway in the skies over Libya , and the U.S. is one of several countries involved . 
It 's our first story in the week 's first edition of CNN Student News . 
AZUZ : It 's called `` Operation Odyssey Dawn , '' and the goal is to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . 
The United Nations Security Council voted for that no-fly zone late last week . 
The coalition responsible for enforcing it is made up of forces from the U.S. , Great Britain and France , among others . 
After the Security Council 's vote , Libya 's government declared a cease-fire in its fighting with rebel forces . 
And it invited representatives from other nations to come to Libya to make sure the cease-fire was real . 
Coalition forces were convinced that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was not following the rules of the cease-fire . 
On Saturday , the coalition attacked . 
You can hear the sounds of gunfire in the capital city of Tripoli . 
A U.S. commander said missiles landed near the capital and around other cities as part of these attacks . 
The fighting between Colonel Gadhafi 's forces and rebels raged on in other cities , like Benghazi . 
Here , you can see a fighter jet that was shot down over Benghazi on Saturday . 
Admiral Michael Mullen , the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , said on Sunday that coalition forces had taken out most of Libya 's air defense systems . 
But Admiral Mullen also said the U.S. role in `` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' would be limited , saying `` we 're not going to put any boots on the ground . '' 
He 's harshly criticized the other countries getting involved with the civil war in Libya . 
He called the coalition forces `` terrorists '' and promised a `` long-drawn war . '' 
But Sunday , a spokesman for the Libyan military called for another cease-fire . 
U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Today , we are both also delivering assistance and support to the Japanese people at their greatest hour of need . 
The ties that bind our nations to Japan are strong . 
In the United States , we forged an alliance of more than sixty years . 
The people of Japan are some of our closest friends , and we will pray with them , and stand with them , and rebuild with them until this crisis has passed . 
AZUZ : We 're starting to see some new effects of the nuclear crisis in Japan that resulted from a tsunami triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake . 
Yesterday , the government health ministry banned the sale of spinach from the area near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . 
Officials made that decision based on radiation levels that were over the government limit . 
There were already bans on the sale of raw milk and restrictions on produce from the area surrounding the nuclear plant . 
Workers inside that power plant were starting to see some signs of progress over the weekend in their efforts to cool down these nuclear reactors . 
But officials say `` even in the best scenario , there will be a lot of bumps ahead . '' 
One they came across Sunday was the possibility that they might need to release radioactive gas into the air . 
They would do that in order to release some of the pressure that 's building up inside one of the reactors . 
The tsunami knocked out the plant 's cooling systems , and getting those back online is crucial . 
Allan Chernoff has a household comparison that helps explain why . 
ALLAN CHERNOFF , CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT , NEW YORK : To get a sense of the challenge confronting the Japanese at the Daiichi nuclear plant , consider this situation in a kitchen : a pot with no water on top of a high flame . 
Obviously , this dangerous situation could cause a fire in here . 
Well , stay with me . 
Those spent nuclear rods can generate tremendous heat , up to 2,100 degrees . 
Enough to melt them , burn them and send radioactive material into the atmosphere . 
They have to be kept under water , just like spaghetti when we 're cooking . 
Now , those rods are normally kept under 30 feet of water , but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , in at least one of the pools in Japan , the rods are exposed ; there 's virtually no water or no water at all . 
So , how do we resolve this situation ? 
Well , if we do n't take the pot off the flame , we add water . 
And that is exactly what the Japanese are trying to do right now ; any way they can , even dumping it from helicopters . 
They are trying desperately to get water into that pool to avoid a nuclear disaster . 
Allan Chernoff , CNN , New York . 
AZUZ : There was some good news on Sunday when rescue workers found an 80-year-old woman and her 16-year-old grandson . 
They 'd been trapped in their home for nine days . 
The news gave hope to other people whose loved ones are still missing . 
But as Gary Tuchman explains , the search efforts are not easy . 
GARY TUCHMAN , CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Kesennuma , Japan . 
The scene behind me here is one of chaos , confusion ; it is surreal . 
If you see the video we took , you wo n't believe it . 
At least , we did n't when we saw it in person . 
So much debris , so much rubble . 
It is like a canyon . 
When we went down there , it 's like climbing a mountain . 
Cars , boats , houses : pushed out of different neighborhoods , pushed out of different areas and blocking fire officials , military officials . 
They 're looking for survivors , the possibility of survivors , or trying to find bodies . 
We met a woman today who told us her father was at the second floor of his house , made the decision to stay in the second floor when the tsunami siren sounded . 
Well , anyway , at this point , they ca n't get to the house . 
It appears the house is still there , but there 's so much rubble surrounding the house , there 's no way to check if this man survived . 
It 's just an absolutely incredible scene . 
It 's hard to imagine what the people here in northeastern Japan are going through . 
The death toll is rising rapidly . 
We know it will continue to rise . 
We ourselves , just myself and my crew , found a body in the back of a car . 
This is how they 're finding bodies , the officials . 
There 's so much rubble down there they ca n't get to . 
It 's very likely that it will be weeks or months before they come anywhere close to knowing what this death toll is . 
And the aftershocks continue . 
Last night , while we were sleeping , we felt at least six or seven sizable aftershocks , and that only increases the anxiety that people feel here in northeastern Japan . 
This is Gary Tuchman , CNN , in Japan .

AZUZ : Haiti : a nation still struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake that hit it more than a year ago . 
It 's also trying to resolve a presidential election from last November . 
None of the candidates got enough votes for an outright victory . 
Yesterday , Haitians headed to the polls to vote in a runoff election . 
One candidate is a former law professor and first lady . 
The other is a Haitian entertainer . 
There were some problems early on at a couple polling locations : missing ballot boxes , and not enough ink to mark who had voted . 
But officials said those issues were resolved by later in the morning . 
The final results of the runoff are scheduled to be released in mid-April .

2011-03-20,"TRIPOLI | Sun Mar 20 , 2011 7:55 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Western powers pressed ahead on Sunday with a campaign of air attacks in Libya , promising more strikes despite criticism by the Arab League . 
U.S. military officials said Saturday 's strikes had halted an advance by Muammar Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern rebel stronghold Benghazi and hit his air defenses , allowing western powers to send in planes to impose a no-fly zone . 
But the day-old U.N.-mandated military intervention to force Gaddafi 's troops to end attacks on civilians hit a diplomatic setback when the Arab League chief questioned the bombardment . 
`` What is happening in Libya differs from the aim of imposing a no-fly zone , and what we want is the protection of civilians and not the bombardment of more civilians , '' Egypt 's state news agency quoted Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa as saying . 
Gaddafi himself said the air strikes amounted to terrorism and vowed to fight to the death , although at 9 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EDT -RRB- on Sunday an armed forces spokesman said the army was ordering all troops to cease fire immediately . 
The United States and Britain , who along with France , Italy and Canada have joined operation `` Odyssey Dawn , '' dismissed the ceasefire announcement , arguing that Gaddafi 's government had promised and then broken a ceasefire on Friday . 
In central Benghazi , sporadic explosions and heavy firing could be heard in the streets late in the evening . 
A Reuters witness said the firing lasted about 40 minutes . 
Residents had said they feared some of Gaddafi 's troops could try to force their way into the city , where they would be surrounded by civilians and protected from attacks from the air . 
Outside Benghazi , the advance by Gaddafi 's troops was stopped in its tracks , with smoldering , shattered tanks and troop carriers littering the main road . 
The charred bodies of at least 14 government soldiers lay scattered in the desert . 
However , government tanks did move into Misrata , the last rebel-held city in western Libya , seeking the shelter of built-up areas after a base used by Gaddafi 's forces outside was hit by Western air strikes , residents said . 
Abdelbasset , a spokesman for the rebels in Misrata , told Reuters : `` There is fighting between the rebels and Gaddafi 's forces . 
Their tanks are in the center of Misrata ... There are so many casualties we can not count them . '' 
A Libyan government health official said 64 people had been killed in the Western bombardment overnight from Saturday to Sunday , but it was impossible to verify the report . 
The Arab League 's Moussa called for an emergency meeting of the group of 22 states to discuss Libya . 
He requested a report into the bombardment , which he said had `` led to the deaths and injuries of many Libyan civilians . '' 
Arab backing for a no-fly zone provided crucial underpinning for the passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution last week that paved the way for Western action to stop Gaddafi killing civilians as he fights an uprising against his rule . 
The intervention is the biggest against an Arab country since the 2003 invasion of Iraq . 
Withdrawal of Arab support would make it much harder to pursue what some defense analysts say could in any case be a difficult , open-ended campaign with an uncertain outcome . 
Britain and the United States rebuffed Moussa 's comments . 
A senior U.S. official said a U.N. resolution endorsed by Arab states covered `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians , `` which we made very clear includes , but goes beyond , a no-fly zone . '' 
The safe enforcement of the no-fly zone required the targeting of Libya 's air defense capabilities , a British Foreign Ministry spokesman said . 
A spokesman for the rebel movement criticized Moussa 's comments , telling Al Jazeera that more than 8,000 Libyans aligned with the rebel movement had been killed . 
`` Today , when the secretary-general spoke , I was surprised , '' Abdel Hafiz Ghoga said . 
`` What is the mechanism that stops the extermination of the people in Libya , what is the mechanism , Mr Secretary-General ? 
If the protection of civilians is not a humanitarian obligation , what is the mechanism that you propose to us ? '' 
The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , said the no-fly zone was now in place . 
But he told CBS television the endgame of military action was `` very uncertain '' and acknowledged it could end in a stalemate with Gaddafi . 
Mullen said he had seen no reports of civilian casualties from the Western strikes . 
But Russia said there had been such casualties and called on Britain , France and the United States to halt the `` non-selective use of force . '' 
Libyan state television showed footage from an unidentified hospital of what it called victims of the `` colonial enemy . '' 
Ten bodies were wrapped up in white and blue bed sheets , and several people were wounded , one of them badly , the television said . 
The Libyan government has denied breaking a ceasefire that it announced on Friday , blaming rebels who it says are members of al Qaeda . 
The armed forces spokesman announced a new ceasefire on Sunday , saying that `` the Libyan armed forces ... have issued a command to all military units to safeguard an immediate ceasefire from 9 p.m. -LRB- 1900 GMT -RRB- this evening . '' 
Both before and after he spoke , heavy anti-aircraft gunfire boomed above central Tripoli . 
A senior military official said the United States expected to conduct more strikes on Libya . 
`` This is an ongoing military operation . 
I fully expect more strikes , '' he said . 
Britain said it was taking part in a second night of coordinated strikes and had once more launched Tomahawk cruise missiles from a submarine in the Mediterranean . 
Italy said it also had planes in the air . 
The United States , after embarking on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , has been reluctant to take the lead in the military operation , keen to leave this to France and Britain while also assembling a large coalition to support it . 
French planes fired the first shots of the intervention on Saturday , destroying tanks and armored vehicles near Benghazi . 
France sent an aircraft carrier toward Libya and its planes were over the country again on Sunday , defense officials said . 
Britain said its planes had targeted Libya 's air defenses , mainly around the capital Tripoli . 
U.S. and British warships and submarines launched 110 Tomahawk missiles on Saturday night and Sunday morning against air defenses around Tripoli and Misrata , U.S. officials said . 
Aircraft from other countries , including Qatar , were also moving toward Libya to participate in the operation , Mullen said .

And the goal is to do what ? 
Change the government -- the traditional purpose of WAR . 
The excuse `` to protect civilians '' is a novel one . 
I 'll give the imperial powers credit for that . 
My guess is civilians will get killed and a civil war prolonged . 
But why are Europe and the US so anxious to overturn Gadhafi after more than 40 years ? 
And were they behind the rebellion to begin with ? 
That was the case in Afghanistan in 1978 , when Carter armed and financed the rebellion that led to Russian intervention and a million deaths . 
I notice that when Israeli aircraft and missiles are used against civilians in Lebanon or Gaza , I do n't see the West threatening anything at all -- no embargo , nothing to prevent Israel from flying and bombing , and surely no attack on tanks or armored vehicles used to kill civilians . 
More than 20,000 civilians in many such attacks going back to 1978 . 
The definition of a bully is `` one who uses strength or power to intimidate or harm others . '' 
Looks like the West , Gadhafi , and Israel have a lot in common . 
As in every other tragedy and including this one , those who have had their homes and families destroyed do not care about geopolitical opinions . 
Anonymous , what on earth are you talking about ? 
This is a secular rebellion against a secular government ! 
Not everything in the Middle East is about religion , you fearmonger . 
What they cheered is irrelevant ; the article did n't say , so why are you assuming that it was `` Allah Akbar '' -LRB- No different than a Christian saying `` Thank God ! '' 
, for your information -RRB- ? 
I 'm sick of these Muslim-Haters commenting on news articles , spreading their irrational paranoia to others like the disease it is . 
Bush is n't president anymore . 
The politics of fear are over ! 
Get over it ; al Qaida has \* NOTHING \* to do with the popular rebellion in Libya , so just drop it , hatemonger ! 
As for whether a war is good or bad , the issue is that this was already a war well before the West got involved . 
It was just a monstrously unfair war , with the side of the despot being armed with sophisticate weapons of war that the rebelling patriots just could n't stand against . 
The point of establishing the no-fly zone is so that the people of Libya can fight this issue out for themselves , without one side simply wiping out the other summarily . 
The forces of Gadhafi were already destroying the homes of innocent civilians , and the Western Coalition is only attacking military targets , exclusively . 
War is a horrible thing when it happens , but it is part of human nature , and at times when a people are dealing with a fascist despot that will not let go of power through peaceful\/diplomatic means , then war is what is left . 
I hate war more than most people , but people have to think ; if England came up with a powerful weapon that was wiping out hundreds of American Rebel Troops during the US War of Independence and they could do nothing to stand against it , would n't you have wanted Spain or some other big global power at the time to step in and stop that mega-weapon from being used , so that the war did n't turn into a genocide ?

2011-03-21,"Gen. Wesley Clark : No-fly zone is established , some military objectives achieved He says the more difficult questions are the diplomatic ones Clark asks : Will Libya be split by the civil war ? 
Clark : Will Moammar Gadhafi be held to account for violence against civilians Editor 's note : CNN Contributor Wesley Clark , a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations , is a retired general and former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . 
Little Rock , Arkansas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The coalition is concluding its second day of air operations . 
The no-fly zone is established . 
A column of Libyan military vehicles , driving on a road toward Benghazi , has been attacked and destroyed . 
This is what much of the world had been crying out for . 
Yet the major questions have always been less about the military feasibility of the operation and more about its political goals ands how to achieve them . 
Although several world leaders have called for Col. Moammar Gadhafi to give up power in Libya , the authorizing U.N. Security Council resolution did not call for this . 
No-fly zone a slippery slope to more ? 
-- Assuming the opposition forces are safe in Benghazi , then what must be done to protect civilians in those towns previously held by the opposition but have now been retaken by Gadhafi 's forces ? 
Presumably some U.N. presence must enter these areas and work to identify and protect civilians . 
This will likely be resisted by Gadhafi and could spur further conflict . 
-- Will the U.N. and the coalition be satisfied with a political stalemate on the ground , in which the eastern portion of the country achieves de facto and de jure independence ? 
The cease-fire called for in the resolution would seem to rule out any renewed offensive activity by the opposition . 
So unless there is some means to apply additional leverage , there may be two Libyas : one a vengeful dictatorship , the other a fledgling democracy needing long-term international protection . 
-- Will Gadhafi be held legally accountable for the excessive violence already exercised against innocent civilians ? 
This will require an investigation on the ground in Tripoli and other cities now under Gadhafi 's control . 
He is not likely to accept this . 
Meanwhile , Gadhafi is doing his best to characterize the action as one of `` Crusaders attacking Muslims , '' and claiming excessive collateral damages , including civilian casualties , from the coalition 's initial air strikes . 
One of the basic rules of intervention is to get it over with quickly . 
From the military standpoint , this has been done . 
But how these initial military actions will relate to the stated -- and unstated -- goals of the operation remains the major challenge for the coalition . 
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wesley Clark .

2011-03-21,"Libya and Iraq : What 's different Peter Bergen : Some compare military action in Libya to Iraq War He says there are major differences , including Arab League 's vote vs. Gadhafi Bergen says the Iraq War was strongly opposed by Arab nations Gadhafi is widely reviled in the Arab world , Bergen says Editor 's note : Peter Bergen is the director of the national security studies program at the New America Foundation in Washington ; a fellow at New York University 's Center on Law and Security ; and CNN 's national security analyst . 
He is the author of the new book , '' The Longest War : The Enduring Conflict between America and Al-Qaeda . '' 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A critique of the U.S. involvement in the military intervention in Libya that will no doubt be common in coming days is that the Obama administration is making a large error by embarking on a war with a third Muslim country , as if reversing Moammar Gadhafi 's momentum against the rebels will be a rerun of the debacle of the war against Saddam Hussein . 
A further element of this view is that -- whatever the outcome of the Libyan intervention -- the United States ' standing in the Islamic world will once again be severely damaged by an attack on a Muslim nation . 
There are , of course , some real similarities between Hussein and Gadhafi -- both ruthless and erratic dictators of oil-rich regimes who fought bloody wars with their neighbors , brutalized their own populations , sought weapons of mass destruction , and sired some equally unattractive sons and heirs . 
The dj vu quality of the Libyan situation may help account for recent polls taken before the intervention which found that while Americans were either split or slightly in favor of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya , most were opposed to stronger U.S. military action . 
The military intervention that President Obama authorized against Libya on Saturday ... is a quite different operation than the 2003 invasion of Iraq . 
But the military intervention that President Obama authorized against Libya on Saturday -- eight years to the day after President George W. Bush announced the commencement of `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' -- is a quite different operation than the 2003 invasion of Iraq . 
Beyond the obvious difference that Obama has not authorized the use of U.S. ground forces in Libya , there are several other differences to consider : First , the Obama administration was handed a gift by the Arab League , which in its more than six-decade history has garnered a well-earned reputation as a feckless talking shop , but unusually took a stand one week ago by endorsing a no-fly zone over Libya . 
That endorsement put the Arab League way out in front of the Obama administration , which was then dithering about whether to do anything of substance to help the rebels fighting Gadhafi . 
The unexpected action by the Arab League gave the administration the impetus and diplomatic cover to then go to the United Nations Security Council to secure a broad resolution endorsing not only a no-fly zone , but also allowing member states to `` take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians in Libya . 
This U.N. resolution is reminiscent of the one that President George H.W. Bush secured in November 1990 , which gave Iraq six weeks to withdraw from Kuwait following Hussein 's invasion of that country . 
The U.N. resolution in 1990 similarly empowered states to use `` all necessary means '' to force Iraq out of Kuwait if Hussein ignored the deadline . 
The similarities do not end there . 
The coalition that massed to drive Hussein out of Kuwait involved significant forces from major Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan . 
So too the Libyan no-fly zone will be enforced by Qatar , along with western powers such as France and the U.K. . 
This is all quite in contrast to George W. Bush 's ineffectual attempts to gather international support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . 
There was no U.N. resolution explicitly authorizing the use of military force against Hussein , and no Muslim countries participated in the American invasion and occupation of Iraq . 
Indeed , before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq , the Turkish parliament voted against allowing American troops passage across Turkey to invade northern Iraq , which put a wrench in U.S. military planning . 
Underlining the fact that the Iraq War was widely viewed as illegitimate by Muslim countries , the same year that Turkey voted against allowing American soldiers to use its soil to attack Iraq , Turkish soldiers were also leading the International Security Assistance Force helping to keep the peace in post-Taliban Afghanistan , a military operation that was also authorized by the United Nations and was not seen as illegitimate by much of the Muslim world . 
The Bush administration 's largely unilateral decision to go to war in Iraq -LRB- the U.K. and a few other nations provided troops -RRB- undermined America 's standing in Islamic countries . 
A poll taken a few months after the 2003 invasion found that Indonesians , Jordanians , Turks , and Moroccans all expressed more `` confidence '' that Osama bin Laden would `` do the right thing '' than that Bush would . 
According to a poll four years later , America 's favorability rating stood at 9 % in Turkey -LRB- down from 52 % before September 11 , 2001 -RRB- and 29 % in Indonesia -LRB- down from 75 % before September 11 -RRB- . 
Finally , another key difference between the Iraq war and the Libyan operation is that the casus belli for Iraq was based on highly classified intelligence accessible to few people -- later proved to be wrong -- that Saddam Hussein continued to maintain a weapons of mass destruction program . 
By contrast , the Libyan intervention was caused by the real time evidence provided by the world 's leading media organizations -- including , of course , Al Jazeera -- that Gadhafi is massacring his own people . 
The high level of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world that was generated by the Iraq War is unlikely to be replicated by U.S. military action against Libya , because Gadhafi is widely reviled in the Arab world . 
His antics on the world stage have earned him the enmity of even his fellow autocrats -- who will not be welcoming him if he chooses to `` retire '' to Saudi Arabia as other murderous dictators of his ilk have in the past -LRB- think Idi Amin -RRB- . 
And the fact that both the Arab League and the United Nations have endorsed a military action against Gadhafi strongly suggests that the Libyan intervention will not generate a renewed wave of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world . 
Instead , it underlines a striking feature of the protests that have roiled the Middle East in the past several weeks : Strikingly absent from those protests has been the ritualized burning of American flags , something that hitherto was largely pro forma in that part of the world . 
That 's because Arabs have finally been able to express publicly that their biggest enemy is not the United States , but their own rulers . 
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen .

2011-03-21,"No-fly zone is being enforced but what is the endgame for Libya ? 
As coalition forces continue to attack Libya and impose a no-fly zone , Moammar Gadhafi 's regime is under the greatest pressure it has faced in its 42-year reign . 
But questions are being asked as to what will emerge from the bombardment . 
Will Gadhafi survive and if so what will his next move be ? 
What happens if he is toppled or even killed and who would run the country ? 
Can Libya ever enjoy peace and prosperity or is it set to be ravaged by a long and bloody civil war ? 
CNN spoke to some experts to hear what they think the endgame could be . 
What follows are some of their thoughts . 
Fawaz Gerges , professor of Middle Eastern Politics and International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science , said he expected the conflict to drag on . 
`` Libya 's political landscape is uncertain but I think that Gadhafi will fight on and on and this could be very prolonged . 
`` It could also see Libya become extremely divided with maybe Gadhafi continuing to rule one half of the country and the other half being ruled separately . 
`` This would likely create a prolonged civil war . 
I think Gadhafi will hang on -- he has very little choice anyway as there is nowhere for him to go , he has been backed into a corner by the coalition . 
We must remember that there were no-fly zones imposed on Iraq in 1991 and 1993 and still Saddam Hussein remained in power . 
`` I think the result of military action will be a very fractious Libya . 
Military action could also turn public opinion within Libya once they begin to see casualties from air strikes . 
This could strengthen Gadhafi rather than weaken him . 
`` Even if we were to see Gadhafi killed , this would create a political vacuum which could see a long civil war which the West would have to take sides on . 
`` We do n't know how divided Libya is ; we do n't know the strength of feeling for regime change . 
There is also a sense of increasing anxiety in the Arab League . 
`` I think Gadhafi will hold on for a long time . 
We also have to consider the wider implications for the whole of the Middle East . 
This could cause further instability throughout the Middle East and not just Libya . '' 
Libya could have great future ... Marco Vicenzino , chief strategy adviser at the Afghanistan World Foundation , said the future for Libya could be bright if its wealth was fairly distributed . 
`` What happens next very much depends on whether Gadhafi survives or how long he fights to survive and that could be a long time .

2011-03-21,"N.Y. Times journalists arrive in Tunisia after being freed in Libya Stephen Farrell , from left , Tyler Hicks , Ambassador Levent Sahin Kaya , Lynsey Addario , and Anthony Shadid pose on Monday . 
Four New York Times journalists who were reported captured by pro-government forces in Libya last week have been released and have arrived safely in Tunisia , Executive Editor Bill Keller said Monday in an e-mail obtained by CNN . 
`` We 're particularly indebted to the Government of Turkey , which intervened on our behalf to oversee the release of our journalists and bring them to Tunisia , '' Keller said in the e-mail , which was sent to New York Times staff . 
`` We were also assisted throughout the week by diplomats from the United States and United Kingdom . '' 
Earlier Monday , Turkish Ambassador to Libya Levent Sahin Kaya said the four journalists had arrived at the Turkish Embassy in Tripoli . 
The newspaper identified the journalists as Anthony Shadid , its bureau chief in Beirut , Lebanon , and a two-time Pulitzer winner for foreign reporting ; Stephen Farrell , a reporter and videographer who was kidnapped by the Taliban and rescued by British commandos in 2009 ; Tyler Hicks , a staffer who is based in Istanbul and has served as an embedded journalist in Afghanistan ; and photographer Lynsey Addario , who has covered the Middle East and Africa . 
In a statement Monday , the newspaper said : `` We are grateful that our journalists have been released , and we are working to reunite them with their families . 
We have been told they are in good health and are in the process of confirming that . 
We thank the Turkish , British , and U.S. governments for their assistance in the release . 
We also appreciate the efforts of those in the Libyan government who helped secure the release this morning . '' 
The four journalists entered the rebel-controlled eastern region of Libya via the Egyptian border without visas to cover the civil war in the country , the Times said . 
They had been missing since Tuesday , according to the Times , but Keller said in his e-mail that the four `` were allowed to speak to their families by phone Thursday night '' and that the government had informed the newpaper Thursday afternoon that they would be freed . 
`` Because of the volatile situation in Libya , we 've kept our enthusiasm and comments in check until they were out of the country , '' Keller wrote , `` but now feels like a moment for celebration . 
And before long we 'll all know the details of their experience . ''

2011-03-21,"19 U.S. warplanes were used in airstrikes More than 110 Tomahawk Cruise missiles were launched Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nineteen U.S. warplanes , including Marine Corps Harrier jets , Air Force B-2 stealth bombers and F-15 and F-16 fighter jets , conducted strike operations against Libya Sunday morning , according to Lt. Cmdr. James Stockman of U.S. Africa Command . 
It is the next phase in Operation Odyssey Dawn , which began about 3 p.m. ET Saturday with the launch of more than 110 Tomahawk Cruise missiles from U.S. and British warships and subs . 
The U.S. Navy launched four Harrier `` jump jets '' from the USS Kearsarge , an amphibious assault ship now in the Mediterranean Sea . 
The Harriers `` conducted strikes against Gadhafi 's ground forces and air defenses , joining an international effort to halt an offensive against the Libyan populace , '' said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Danny Hernandez . 
The U.S. Navy also flew EA-18 Growlers , which are special versions of the F\/A 18 fighter designed to jam enemy electronic signals , such as targeting radar from enemy air defense batteries , Hernandez said . 
Italian jets return from Libya Obama : No ground troops in Libya Fighter jets hit Libyan army convoy All American warplanes returned safely from their missions , according to U.S. Africa Command . 
On Sunday , Maj. Gen. John Lorimer , spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense , said British maritime assets including a submarine and two warships are in theater , backing the Tornado GR4s which returned to the Royal Air Force 's Lyneham station Sunday morning . 
` We 're really setting the conditions for the implementation of the no-fly zone , '' said Lorimer . 
`` In order to do that we need to attack targets which are the integrated air defense system , which will include radars and command and control centers . 
We 've got to deal with those first before being able to implement the no-fly zone as laid out by the UNSCR , '' he said . 
Lorimer added that a multi-purpose Typhoon aircraft is ready to be deployed . 
`` Protecting the innocent and conducting combined operations are what we are designed to do , '' said Col. Mark J. Desens , commanding officer of 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit , the Marines operating off the Kearsarge . 
`` Our forces are doing both as part of the U.S. commitment to protect Libyan citizens . '' 
Italy -- Libya 's former colonial power -- announced that as of midnight Sunday , four Tornado warplanes and four F-16s will be made available .

2011-03-21,"The opposition claims the government is displaying those killed earlier U.S. officials reach out to the Arab League `` We are not going after Gadhafi , '' an American admiral says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Airstrikes Sunday in the heart of Moammar Gadhafi 's Tripoli compound had a military objective but also no doubt brought a message of allied resolve to the Libyan leader 's doorstep . 
A coalition military official confirmed to CNN that the compound was targeted because it contains capabilities to exercise command and control over Libyan forces . 
The coalition 's goal is to degrade Gadhafi 's military capabilities . 
The official , who was not identified because of the sensitivity of the information , insisted that neither Gadhafi nor his residence was the intended target . 
The leader 's whereabouts were not known . 
Earlier , Western journalists , including CNN 's Nic Robertson , were brought inside by Libyan officials to survey the destruction . 
Gallery : Civil war in Libya A four-story building was heavily damaged , possibly by cruise missiles , Robertson reported . 
Robertson said early Monday that two circular holes in the building may be telltale signs of such missiles , although that could not be immediately confirmed . 
The building is only 100 yards or so from a statue of a golden fist crushing a model plane emblazoned with `` USA '' -- a monument to the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya , in which one U.S. plane was downed . 
Special guests who visit Gadhafi at a nearby large tent are usually housed in the building , reported Robertson , who held a chunk of metal with a label indicating military usage . 
Video footage showed collapsed columns , pieces of weaponry and chunks of concrete . 
There were no reported casualties . 
U.S. officials said they are not targeting the leader , who has defied international calls to stop attacking opposition forces . 
`` We are not going after Gadhafi , '' U.S. Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at a Pentagon press briefing . 
`` Regime forces are more pressed and less free to maneuver . '' 
Asked about reports of smoke rising from the area of Gadhafi 's palace , Gortney said , `` We are not targeting his residence . '' 
The United States , detailing significant damage to Gadhafi 's air defenses and a military convoy , also fought a public relations campaign Sunday , insisting that two days of coalition bombing were n't going beyond mandates in the United Nations Security Council resolution . 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned against widening the current allied operations to include a direct attack on Gadhafi , who earlier Sunday labeled the coalition `` terrorists . '' 
Anything that goes beyond enforcement of the no-fly zone and prevention of new military attacks on rebels risks disrupting the `` very diverse coalition '' that agreed to the attacks , said Gates , adding there was unanimous agreement in the top echelons of the Obama administration to push forward with military action in Libya . 
U.S. officials said they plan to hand over operational control of the military mission in coming days . 
The coalition has nine other announced partners : Belgium , Britain , Canada , Denmark , France , Italy , Norway , Qatar and Spain . 
Gates said the operation is off to `` a strong and successful start . '' 
He made the comments while traveling to Russia , which said earlier Sunday that innocent civilians were being killed and urged more caution . 
The Foreign Ministry in Moscow cited reports that `` nonmilitary '' targets were being bombed , including a cardiac center . 
A look at coalition 's military hardware Coalition air strike : The first hours `` We have no indication of any civilian casualties , '' Gortney said . 
A member of the Libyan opposition told CNN that the Gadhafi government collected bodies of people killed in fighting in the past week and displayed them over the weekend , trying to show they were killed by coalition airstrikes . 
The claim by Ahmed Gebreel , who cited eyewitnesses and medical officials , could not be verified by CNN . 
The Libyan military on Sunday called an immediate cease-fire after allied forces pounded one of its convoys near Benghazi and , according to U.S. officials , significantly degraded the regime 's air defenses . 
National Security Adviser Tom Donilon scoffed at the report of the cease-fire , saying , `` It is n't true , or it was immediately violated . '' 
Meanwhile , President Barack Obama and his national security team worked behind the scenes to shore up support within the Arab world for the military mission in Libya , according to senior administration officials . 
The senior officials described the Obama team 's phone calls as making clear to the Arab League that bombing Gadhafi 's air defenses falls within the Security Council resolution 's scope of imposing a no-fly zone and taking `` all necessary measures '' to stop the dictator from attacking civilians in his own country . 
`` We do n't believe this goes beyond the resolution , '' said one senior administration official . 
The lobbying came after Arab League officials complained earlier Sunday that the bombing by the U.S. military and other allies inside Libya exceeded the scope of merely instituting a no-fly zone . 
Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa told reporters before an emergency meeting Sunday that what is happening in Libya is different from what was intended by imposing a no-fly zone , according to Egypt 's state-run Ahram newspaper . 
`` What we want is the protection of civilians and not the shelling of more civilians , '' Moussa said , adding that `` military operations may not be needed in order to protect the civilians . '' 
But Arab League chief of staff Hisham Youssef said Moussa 's comments did not signify a shift by the organization . 
`` The Arab League position has not changed . 
We fully support the implementation of a no-fly zone , '' Youssef said . 
`` Our ultimate aim is to end the bloodshed and achieve the aspirations of the Libyan people . '' 
On TV news shows in the United States , politicians debated the military campaign 's possible endgame . 
`` This is a very limited operation that is geared to save lives , and it was specifically targeted on a humanitarian basis , '' Senator John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' 
Senator Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that this is the `` best chance to get rid of Gadhafi in my life . '' 
`` If we do n't get rid of him , we will pay a heavy price down the road , '' Graham said . 
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told CNN that Gadhafi forces have shown little ability to counter coalition firepower . 
Allied aircraft struck a Misrata area airport that has both civilian and military uses , Gortney said . 
Three B-2 bombers struck only military positions at the airfield , he said . 
There was violence across the country Sunday , with Gadhafi apparently shelling rebels in the west , while allied airstrikes destroyed one of Gadhafi 's convoys in the east . 
As of Sunday night local time , the United States and British military had fired a total of 124 Tomahawk missiles at Libya 's air defense sites , Gortney said . 
Gadhafi had said the strikes were a confrontation between the Libyan people and `` the new Nazis '' and promised `` a long-drawn war . '' 
`` You have proven to the world that you are not civilized , that you are terrorists -- animals attacking a safe nation that did nothing against you , '' Gadhafi had said in an earlier televised speech . 
At the same time Gadhafi spoke , his regime was shelling Misrata using tanks , artillery and cannons , a witness said . 
`` They are destroying the city , '' said the witness , who is not being identified for safety reasons . 
He said rebels were fighting back . 
Sounds of heavy gunfire could be heard during a telephone conversation with the man . 
CNN 's Arwa Damon saw outside Benghazi the remains of a convoy of at least 70 military vehicles destroyed by multiple airstrikes Sunday , leaving at least five charred bodies , plus twisted tanks and smashed trucks as far as she could see . 
Rebels with Damon told her it was a convoy of Libyan troops loyal to Gadhafi coming to attack Benghazi . 
Residents of the city , which was reported to be calm late Sunday , believe they can now take the offensive against loyalist troops .

2011-03-21,"Credit : Reuters\/Parbul TV via Reuters TV LONDON | Mon Mar 21 , 2011 10:54 pm GMT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Prime Minister David Cameron tried to reassure a war-weary public on Monday that Britain 's military involvement in Libya will not drag it into another Iraq-style conflict . 
After a six-hour debate , parliament voted overwhelmingly to support Cameron 's decision to send British planes and ships to help enforce a no-fly zone to stop attacks on civilians by the forces of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
The vote was 557-13 , although some lawmakers voiced fears of getting dragged deeper into the Libyan conflict and others questioned why Britain had chosen to intervene in Libya but not in other crisis-hit countries . 
Hanging heavy over the debate was the shadow of Iraq , where 179 British soldiers were killed in a long-running conflict after former Prime Minister Tony Blair backed then U.S. President George W. Bush 's decision to invade in March 2003 . 
`` This is different to Iraq . 
This is not going into a country , knocking over its government and then owning and being responsible for everything that happens subsequently , '' Cameron said . 
`` This is about protecting people and giving the Libyan people a chance to shape their own destiny , '' he said . 
Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Libya operation would be funded from a Treasury reserve and not from the defense budget , which faces a real-terms cut of 8 percent over the next four years as part of efforts to curb a big budget deficit . 
In a debate almost exactly eight years ago , the British parliament gave Blair a green light to wage war on Iraq despite a massive revolt within his own party . 
The 10-month-old Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government has stressed that the Libya situation is very different from the Iraq war , which clouded Blair 's premiership . 
Unlike the Iraq invasion , the Libya no-fly zone has been authorised by the United Nations and the U.N. Security Council resolution expressly bars occupation . 
Labor leader Ed Miliband supported Cameron , saying : `` We have seen with our own eyes what the Libyan regime is capable of . 
We 've seen guns being turned on unarmed demonstrators . '' 
But some MPs , particularly left-wing Labor members , voiced doubts about what Britain was getting into . 
`` I 'm far from convinced that the public are behind this , '' Labor legislator Jeremy Corbyn said . 
`` They are very concerned about where it leads to because they 've been through the miserable experience of Iraq and they have deep concerns additionally about Afghanistan , '' he said . 
Britain has 10,000 troops fighting Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan . 
`` We should n't be in there , we 've got enough on our plate in Afghanistan , '' said Neil Wozencroft , a 35-year-old pipe fitter , told Reuters when asked about the Libya campaign . 
`` It 's a civil war and we should n't get involved , plus there are other atrocities in the world -- the Congo and Zimbabwe . 
We ca n't be the world 's peacekeepers . '' 
Conservative MP Edward Leigh called for a rethink of last year 's British defense review which he said had been a `` disaster . '' 
The review has paved the way for sharp cuts in armed forces ' equipment and personnel . 
Cameron said there was no action without risk . 
`` But ... we have to weigh the risks of inaction ... the consequences for Europe of a failed pariah state on its southern border . 
All of these , in my view , are simply too great to ignore , '' he said . 
"
2011-03-21,"TRIPOLI | Mon Mar 21 , 2011 11:00 pm GMT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Attacks on Libya are likely to slow in the coming days , a U.S. general said on Monday , as Western powers consolidate a no-fly zone that some say is unlikely to bring an early end to the country 's civil war . 
Rebels who began a revolt against Muammar Gaddafi a month ago have so far done little to capitalize on a two-day bombardment that halted an advance by government forces on their Benghazi stronghold and targeted Libya 's air defences . 
But Washington , wary of being sucked into another war after long campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan , has ruled out specific action to overthrow Gaddafi , though France said on Monday it hoped the Libyan government would collapse from within . 
`` My sense is that -- that unless something unusual or unexpected happens , we may see a decline in the frequency of attacks , '' General Carter Ham , who is leading U.S. forces in the Libyan operation , told reporters in Washington . 
He added , however , that `` we possess the capability to bring overwhelming combat power to bear , as we have done in the initial stages of this , where it 's been required . '' 
Libyan state television reported that several sites in the capital Tripoli had been subject to new attacks by what it called the `` crusader enemy '' on Monday . 
Reuters reporters heard two big explosions followed by anti-aircraft fire in Tripoli on Monday evening . 
The United States has run into some criticism for the intensity of the firepower used on Libya , which included more than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired on Saturday to take out Libya 's air defences and allow Western planes to patrol the skies . 
Although a U.N. resolution authorised `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians , Arab League chief Amr Moussa has questioned the methods used , while Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin compared the air campaign to `` medieval crusades . '' 
President Barack Obama said the United States , which has been joined by Britain , France , Canada and Italy among others in the air campaign , planned to transfer the lead military role shortly . 
Britain and France led calls for the intervention . 
`` We anticipate this transition to take place in a matter of days and not in a matter of weeks , '' Obama told a news conference during a visit to Chile . 
Libyan rebels have welcomed the air strikes and at the frontline along the coast from Benghazi have cheered warplanes as they roar overhead . 
Rebel headquarters also say they are coordinating with the Western powers launching air strikes . 
But there was little sign at the vanguard of battle in east Libya that this communication extended to forward rebel units . 
Western powers say they are not providing close air support to rebels or seeking to destroy Gaddafi 's army , but rather only protecting civilians , as their U.N. mandate allows , leaving disorganised rebel fighters struggling to make headway . 
`` If we do n't get more help from the West , Gaddafi 's forces will eat us alive , '' rebel fighter Nouh Musmari told Reuters . 
Leaders of the rebel movement in Benghazi have admitted their forces need more training . 
In the past , they also complained their over-enthusiastic fighters were too quick to race ahead , only to be driven back by Gaddafi 's army . 
Gaddafi 's forces have also tried to push into cities where they would be less vulnerable to attack from the air , while in the capital Tripoli people have rallied to support their leader . 
Security analysts say they are unclear what will happen if the Libyan leader digs in , especially since Western powers have made clear they would be unwilling to see Libya partitioned between a rebel-held east and Gaddafi-controlled west . 
`` Libya will not be a cakewalk , '' said Glen Howard , president of the Jamestown Foundation think tank . 
He added that the conflict 's current phase was reminiscent of the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 , which failed to meet expectations it would bring down Slobodan Milosevic within days . 
`` There is still a real risk of a protracted stalemate , with neither side wanting to negotiate . 
So the endgame remains very unclear , '' said Jeremy Binnie , a senior analyst with IHS Jane 's . 
In an appearance on Libyan television on Sunday , Gaddafi promised his enemies a `` long war . '' 
Officials in Tripoli said earlier that one missile in the second wave of attacks , which they said was intended to kill Gaddafi , had destroyed a building in his fortified compound , heavily bombed in 1986 by the Reagan administration . 
`` It was a barbaric bombing , '' said government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim , showing pieces of shrapnel that he said came from the missile . 
`` This contradicts American and Western -LRB- statements -RRB- ... that it is not their target to attack this place . '' 
A Libyan government spokesman also said that foreign attacks had killed many people by bombing ports and Sirte airport . 
`` You saw that place -LRB- Sirte airport -RRB- , '' Mussa Ibrahim told a news conference . 
`` It 's a civilian airport . 
It was bombarded and many people were killed . 
Harbours were also bombarded . '' 
British Prime Minister David Cameron said there were no plans to target Gaddafi . 
`` The U.N. resolution is limited in its scope , it explicitly does not provide legal authority for action to bring about Gaddafi 's removal from power by military means , '' Cameron told parliament . 
`` We will help fulfil the U.N. Security Council -LRB- resolution -RRB- , it is for the Libyan people to determine their government and their destiny , but our view is clear , there is no decent future for Libya with Colonel Gaddafi remaining in power . '' 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said he hoped Libyans themselves would topple Gaddafi : `` When will the regime collapse ? 
It is quite possible that , given the weakness of the regime , it will break up from within . '' 
Gaddafi 's government announced a cease-fire on Sunday but this was dismissed by the United States and Britain , who said an earlier cease-fire pledge had been broken . 
The government accused the rebels of breaking the cease-fire . 
In Misrata , the only major rebel-held city in the west , residents said they had again come under attack on Monday . 
`` The people of Misrata went into the streets and to the -LRB- city -RRB- center , unarmed , in an attempt to stop Gaddafi 's forces entering the city , '' a resident told Reuters by telephone . 
`` When they gathered in the center the Gaddafi forces started shooting at them with artillery and guns . 
They committed a massacre . 
The hospital told us at least nine people were killed , '' said the resident , who gave his name as Saadoun . 
The report could not be independently verified because Libyan authorities prevented reporters from reaching Misrata . 
Residents said water supplies had been cut off and government troops had encircled the city .

2011-03-21,"LONDON | Mon Mar 21 , 2011 8:58 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Only one in three Britons agree with the decision to take military action in Libya , a poll published on Monday showed . 
The ComRes\/ITN poll found that 43 percent disagreed with the action and 22 percent were unsure . 
Just under half of those surveyed felt military action was an unnecessary risk for Britain to take . 
Haunted by the experience of the recent Iraq war and continued losses in Afghanistan , Britons told Reuters they were wary of getting dragged into another lengthy foreign conflict at a time of belt-tightening at home . 
`` We should n't be in there , we 've got enough on our plate in Afghanistan , '' said Neil Wozencroft , a 35-year-old pipe fitter . 
`` It 's a civil war and we should n't get involved , plus there are other atrocities in the world -- the Congo and Mugabe in Zimbabwe . 
We ca n't be the world 's peacekeepers . '' 
Both Britain and France -- who led efforts on a no-fly zone in Libya -- are having to introduce austerity measures to tackle large budget deficits , while at the same time people are having to cope with rising food and fuel prices . 
`` Is it really worth it ? 
I ask myself , '' said widow Roymonde Urien in Paris , concerned the air strikes might lead to a flood of immigrants from Libya . 
All those Londoners quizzed by Reuters agreed they would like to see Gaddafi removed , but not through bombing . 
Despite doubts about the action itself , most praised Prime Minister David Cameron . 
`` He grasped the situation , '' Phil Davis , a 43-year-old civil engineer , said . 
`` He saw it was an issue and reacted to it . '' 
After a six-hour debate , the British parliament voted overwhelmingly on Monday to support Cameron 's decision to send British planes and ships to help enforce a no-fly zone to stop attacks on civilians by Gaddafi 's forces .

2011-03-21,"Analysis : Recent history points to host of Libya war risks LONDON | Mon Mar 21 , 2011 10:22 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Foreign powers attacking Libya may hope air and missile strikes alone will topple Muammar Gaddafi and perhaps usher in democracy -- but recent history suggests they could be in for a long and complex engagement . 
Air strikes aimed at halting ethnic violence had only limited effect in achieving their goals in Bosnia and Kosovo until backed with the threat of effective ground action or at least the deployment of well-armed peacekeepers . 
In Afghanistan , an air campaign and special forces support was enough to oust the Taliban from power after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks -- but that war is far from over a decade on with thousands of NATO troops battling an ongoing insurgency . 
In Iraq , more than a decade of sanctions , a no-fly zone and repeated bouts of air strikes that followed the end of the 1991 war helped Kurdish regions remain largely free from Saddam Hussein but otherwise allowed him to remain in power . 
A change in western policy and overwhelming military force swiftly ended his rule in 2003 , but that proved the beginning of a bloody civil war and protracted U.S.-led military intervention is only just drawing to a close . 
The speed with which Britain , the United States and France have found themselves effectively at war in Libya at a time when much attention was focused on Japan 's earthquake has meant there was little of the public debate that preceded the 2003 Iraq war . 
`` There 's obviously the issue of timing -- that leaving things any longer would have allowed Gaddafi to produce a bloodbath , '' said Anthony Skinner , associate director of political risk consultancy Maplecroft . 
`` But it 's still far from a foregone conclusion that this will work . 
Gaddafi obviously has a vested interest in dragging things out in the hope that he will survive . 
In the long run , stopping him might require the deployment of ground troops and there seems very little appetite for that and resources are very thin . '' 
The United Nations resolution that ushered in action to protect civilians specifically ruled out a foreign occupation but endorsed `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . 
Perhaps deliberately , that leaves many options including limited ground intervention in support of rebels already recognized by France as the legitimate government of Libya . 
The question , analysts say , is how much political will is really there -- and what they want to achieve with it . 
`` The long-term goal , unspoken but well understood , is regime change , '' wrote George Friedman , head of political risk consultancy Stratfor . 
`` It should be remembered that in Iraq and Afghanistan ... regime change was merely the opening act . 
It is possible that the coalition partners have n't decided on the strategy yet , or may not be in agreement . '' 
France and Britain have both occasionally intervened in African civil wars in the past decade -- such as in Sierra Leone in 2001 -- but on the side of governments . 
Backing rebels against a strong central authority is a different matter -- likely requiring more outside intervention should Gaddafi 's rule crumble or collapse . 
`` Once it looks possible to force a political process , the international community will need to back a diplomatic engagement , '' said senior policy fellow Daniel Korski at the European Council on Foreign Relations , a veteran of reconstruction efforts in Iraq , Afghanistan and the former Yugoslavia and strong supporter of intervention in Libya . 
He said the European Union and NATO might have to be involved perhaps with the Arab League or African Union in what he called a `` light-touch monitoring mission . '' 
With French jets targeting Libyan armored vehicles on the outskirts of Benghazi on Saturday , military action has already gone well beyond the `` no-fly zone '' initially suggested by Britain and France and endorsed by the Arab League . 
Even with air strikes , most experts believe the rebels will need outside help to improve their currently near-nonexistent command and control capabilities . 
The bottom line , some strategists say , is that there are some things only ground forces can do . 
Once Gaddafi 's forces are mixed amongst civilian areas , there may be little air strikes can achieve without considerable `` collateral damage . '' 
`` Air power has its limitations , '' said Henry Wilkinson , lead analyst at security consultancy Janusian . 
`` It will not inflict a decisive blow , nor prevent attacks on civilians in all cases . 
Only ground forces can take territory , provide local security and impose their political will upon an enemy . '' 
Analysts point to many unknowns . 
Will intervention in Libya give new confidence to protesters in other autocratic Middle Eastern states including oil producers -- and how might the West respond ? 
Could civilian casualties turn local , regional and domestic Western opinion against the campaign and play into the hands of Islamist militants ? 
`` The early days will go extremely well but will not define whether or not the war is successful , '' wrote Stratfor 's Friedman . 
`` The test will come if a war designed to stop human suffering begins to inflict human suffering . 
That is when the difficult political decisions have to be made . ''

"
2011-03-21,"Western powers launched a second wave of air strikes on Libya on Monday after halting the advance of Muammar Gaddafi 's forces on Benghazi and targeting air defenses to let their planes patrol the skies . 
The U.N.-mandated intervention to protect civilians drew criticism from Arab League chief Amr Moussa , who questioned the need for a heavy bombardment , which he said had killed many civilians . 
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the U.N. resolution resembled `` medieval calls for crusades . '' 
But the United States , carrying out the air strikes in a coalition with Britain , France , Italy and Canada among others , said the campaign was working . 
The intervention is the biggest against an Arab country since the 2003 invasion of Iraq . 
Do you support the U.N.-mandated intervention in Libya ? 
Yes I support the air strikes No I do not support the air strikes Have the Western forces been prudent in their air strikes or shown disregard for civilian casualties ? 
Civilian casualties are an unfortunate and unavoidable side effect of the Western airstrikes Western forces have shown disregard for civilian deaths where does it end ? 
In Yeme , Syria , Bahrein , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , UAE , Nigeria , Ivory Coast , Thailand , Venezuela ? 
This is a slippery slope caused by Anderson Cooper and Fouad Ajami `` greased '' by oil . 
Do we never learn ? 
How many wars will it take till we know , that too many people have died ? 
The majority of them at the hands of U.S. weaponry . 
here we go wading in again blinkered , what is the end game if mr. gaddafi do n't play ball with the west ? 
another occupation of another muslim country ? 
more overstretched british forces poured into another conflict ? 
why ar n't the arab nations taking the lead and dealing with the problem surely the political implications for western involvement is obvious . 
It is no business of the west . 
I from Canada do not support our military action in Libya . 
There are better ways and it saddens me to see Canada jump on the US bandwagon . 
This military action does not benefit the world as a whole , and I hope that Canadians as well as the rest of the world can see this . 
The end does not justify the means . 
At the end of the day , this is a civil war , and 2 % of the world s oil production is simply not worth it ladies and gentlemen of the United Nations . 
It is extremely unfortunate that the innocent citizens of Libya are the victims of Muammar Gaddafi s crazy antics , but ultimately this is their war , and it should remain as such . 
The United States and its allies should seek to help those on their own sidewalks prior to lending it s resources to other nations . 
We too vote strongly for an end to all violence and world peace , but we do not have a magic wand to do so immediately , and as history has proven over and over again , before any major reform or change , war precedes . 
So the rebels are now jumping for joy . 
There is an old saying that says people who jump for joy should beware of the ground moving beneath their feet . 
It 's a bit too soon to know how this will play out . 
One thing for certain is that there will be winners and more losers . 
The last formal declaration of war was 70 years ago ... `` Only the dead have seen the end of war '' . 
-LRB- Plato -RRB- War , will never end . 
From one side or the other , there will be someone who star killing for money or power . 
Even if you pick a side or not , the effects of war will affect your way of living . 
So now the Arab League -- whatever the h3ll that is -- has done a 180 and jumps on us for attacking Qaddafi 's air control system . 
This is exactly why we should never get involved with this stupidity . 
For heaven 's sake Americans -- wake up ! 
And Obama was gonna get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan ? 
-- yeah , right ! 
The Arab league , the African Union , China , Russia -- a paltry few other nations are against this . 
Would it have passed a vote in the General assembly , not a pedophile 's chance in Hell . 
Thank goodness for the Security Council and those who wo n't use their veto . 
Hear that Mssrs Putin and JinTou ? 
You used poor phrasing in the second question and you will note that you had the lowest participation in that question . 
Your question : `` Have the Western forces been prudent in their air strikes or shown disregard for civilian casualties ? '' 
should have had the following choices : \* Western forces have demonstrated care in avoiding civilian casualties during the airstrikes Western forces have shown disregard for civilian deaths Why should Western power take notice of this small African nation in turmoil ? 
It is because of oil , not because of democrazy . 
In any conflict , Western people are always the aggressors . 
History is the witness to this . 
You know the truth is that it does n't end . 
Of course it does n't end as long as there are ruthless dictators like Gaddafi on the planet , and people who are willing to stand and fight . 
For those of you who think we can just sit here and watch the stock market in the safety of our own nation , wake up . 
We do n't control the world anymore , and the only reason we ever came close to doing it was that the rest of the world was bombed back into the middle ages after WW II . 
Now we are learning that unless we have that kind of a head start , we ca n't compete . 
If we do n't start standing for Democracy again instead of big money , we will be a has-been in a very short time . 
The big money is moving quickly to Asia , so now is the time to get back to our principles instead of our financial interests . 
This exercise by the US , UK , and France has nothing to do with Gaddafi . 
We do n't know exactly the reasons but it is not about a `` ruthless dictator . '' 
If that were the case , we would have been bombing most of Africa and the middle east . 
Use your brains , people . 
All of the arab nations even Saudi Arabia will be burning under the bombs of the US . 
This is it boys the final battle between Muslims and Christians . 
It 's the crusades all over again just like George W. Bush said when he invaded Iraq . 
Man your weapons the fight is going to Iran soon . 
We should have used those resources to bomb Iran 's nuclear facilities and their mullahs . 
They are the real threat to us . 
Libya was of no particular importance to us and was not a threat . 
The rebels want us to do the heavy lifting so they can take over , but they will hate us as much as Qadaffi does . 
I must say , today 's comments here are some of the dumbest I 've seen in a long time ... If there had n't been airstrikes , Gaddafi was about to slaughter thousands , and then the chant would 've been `` Oh , the USA can go into countries that benefit them , but they let this slaughter happen , just like in Rwanda ! '' 
Now that the US has followed the request of the Arab League , African Org . 
, to stop a slaughter in a very limited engagement and the same accusations pop up . 
One ca n't have it both ways ; accuse the international community of `` allowing '' slaughter to happen in Rwanda , then criticizing us for trying to stop it this time . 
And how about we wait for data on the ground to tell us whether US forces killed civilians and not take the King of Liars , Gaddafi 's word for it ? 
Russia and China 's playing both sides of the fence is getting EXTREMELY tiring at this point . 
I agree the USA should back away now that we 've dropped the air defenses , but I wanted to post here lamenting the extremely poor quality of the comments here today . 
Bomb Gaddafi 's airforces and ammo dumps . 
Any military columns that appear from Gaddafi 's side . 
Let the rebels fight their way to freedom . 
They are doing the heavy lifting -LRB- fighting and dying -RRB- . 
Our Air Forces and Navys are flying jets and pressing buttons . 
This is the kind of war we should have brought to Iraq in 1991 . 
We should have been protecting the citizens in the north and south when they tried to rebel against Hussein . 
We should have protected them . 
It would have been easier and cheaper than invading the country for a ground war the second time ' round . 
Instead the Republican President and his men told us stories about WMD . 
What the Republicans are doing now as a party to run inteference on Obama amounts to hypocrisy . 
I 'm sure if Obama did nothing then the Republicans would have roasted him for that too . 
The Republicans have been completely counter-productive for the past 6-8 years . 
They supported the people who took down our economy . 
Turned a blind eye . 
Spent our wealth on two unnecessary unproductive ground wars . 
Now they 've done everything they could to undermine our current president when our country needs all our leaders to make productive suggestions and carefully steer our country out of this economic quagmire . 
I supported them in previous elections but NEVER again . 
I 'll vote 3rd or 4th party if necessary . 
I 'll always vote against them . 
If the West had n't gone in there would have been a brutal slaughter and the maniac would have still been in charge -LRB- recharged too -RRB- . 
He would have cracked down that much harder on his own people . 
All he had to do was step down . 
During all these protests in every case the gov ' ts have started shooting first . 
They have started killing their own peoples , their own neighbors . 
Let 's help the Middle East leave the 6th century behind and join the 21st century . 
Our gov ' t also needs to quit funding these kinds of dictators -- see Yemen and Egypt for examples . 
While I do support the NATO action , I would rather see Quadaffi step down , with a Diplomatic soloution . 
the Libyan civilians must be protected from both air and land . 
Perhaps UN blue helmets can be sent in to protect civilians from Quadaffi 's ground assault that cont . 
If the Arab League of Nations , France , and the UK feel it is necessary to attack Libya then we should let them do so . 
Quadaffi must be stopped . 
However , who says the U.S. should have to lead or be involved ? 
We are already fighting two wars and we can not afford a third . 
These other countries have missiles and bombs , why the hell do n't they take care of it ? 
These countries appear to have no conviction . 
They want us to lead so they will have someone to blame if it does n't pan out the way they want it to . 
We should have submitted our approval at the UN and then been done with it . 
We , the United States , can not police the world . 
For once I 'd like to see the Arab League of Nations take care of their own ! 
They have the means to get rid of Quadaffi . 
Now they are criticizing us as usual . 
Why do n't they just admit that they support the governing methods of Quadaffi and reveal their true colors . 
France and Britain need to step up if they really want to do something about this . 
We should support them , short of being involved . 
Gaddafi must be eliminated '' a la Saddam '' Gaddafi is a psychopath who abused Libya , had scores of innocent people in Libya , Europe , etc killed Gaddafi abused human rights for more than 41 years Like David Koresh or Rev Jones of Jonestown , he thinks he is a prophet ... . . 
he has always overestimated himself ... . . 
now he must go and let Libya live in peace and prosperity He dilapidated Libya 's resources for his own gratification . 
He is a murderous dictator and must go now Obama opted for the lesser of two evils . 
And now he is working to minimize US exposure to the financial and geopolitical blowback by pressing to have allies carry the load for a change . 
And yes , those nations that believe democracy and freedom are what is best for people around the world should stand up and help defend those who would fight for it , no matter where they exist . 
Yemen , Syria , Iran , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , anywhere . 
This is n't about religion Mr. Putin and others who prefer the status quo , it is about one less dictatorship or theocratic regime in the world capable of supressing human rights , democracy , and personal freedoms ... including the right to worship as you choose , and to speak your minds as you choose , absent violent repression . 
So where are all the people calling Obama a war criminal ? 
I guess it 's just criminal when a Republican is in office . 
Or I am to gather that finally people have woken up a bit to realize the world is better off without tyrants and that doing nothing really means supporting those tyrants actions ? 
The difference between what happened in Egypt versus what happened in Libya is that Libyan citizens took up arms against their government . 
The moment they did that , civil disobedience became a civil war . 
It seems to me that deciding to support a military action like this is a low cost opportunity to pick up GW Bush 's baton in trying to encourage democracy to be adopted in the area . 
There must be a strategic benefit or we would n't act . 
this war is not about the freedom of Libyans . 
It is all about controlling Libyan OIL . 
What about the democracy in Saudi Srabia -LRB- one of the most brutal regimes in the world -RRB- !! What about Bahrain ? 
They wont do anything to these countries coz they already have the control over their OIL . 
And what about the other half of Libyans who support Gaddafi ? 
Their opinion doesnt count ? 
Why doesnt the west bomb China then , poor Tibetans , under brutal Chinese rule for more than 50 years ? 
Coz Tibet doesnt have any OIL that the west can not exploit . 
Why no fly zone in Ivory Coast ... more people dead there than in Libya . 
Its so sad to see that western powers ignoring all these and expecting the people around the world believe their selfish reasoning . 
You really gotta love these polls . 
You got a majority supporting Obama 's cowardly air strikes , while at the same time , that same majority opposes sending in ground troops that can effectively end the whole situation immediately . 
Please I pray to my GOD that we do not let this golden chance to take out this insane madman now that we have been given the green light to go for it pass us by ? 
Recently Ireland changed its government , in peaceful election . 
The people voted to change a government that was damaging the interests of the people of Ireland . 
Until the people in countries across the world want to vote to change their governments , dictators like Gadaffi and his ilk steal away peoples freedom and there precious lives . 
Freedom has to be taken by you , or is taken from you . 
George W. Bush stated that the Iraq war was justified to free the Iraqi people and spread democracy . 
That was a full invasion . 
Now we have potentially the whole Arab world doing exactly that -LRB- take matters in their own hand -RRB- and we do n't even want to give them aircover and drop some bombs ?? Come on people , stop the hypocrisy . 
Have you seen anyone burning US flags ? 
I have n't and I think that is a good thing for once . 
So let 's give them a helping hand . 
They may thank us . 
Other than that , we should stop buying their oil . 
No oil , no money for their leaders\/dictators . 
The US Constitution demands that every US President obtain a Declaration of War from Congress unless the US is in imminent danger . 
-- - President Obama ignored Congress and went on a junket . 
-- - President Bush II was guilty of the same crimes and it 's a pity and an indictment of our society that he was n't impeached . 
-- - Just because we ` do n't like ' a foreign leader does not give our country the right or the moral imperitive to meddle offensively in their matters . 
-- - Having the UN front for our trespasses does n't make them right . 
We were supposed to be in and out of Korea , Vietnam , Iraq , and Afghanistan . 
None of these predictions came true . 
We ca n't afford to be the world 's policeman . 
It is interesting to read historical accounts of those actually subject to tyranny such as a Russian in a Stalin gulag and a Jew in Auschwitz both wished for the bombs to rain from the sky to release them from their hell on earth . 
They did not care if they were killed in the process but at least it would be an indication fellow humanity was willing to fight to save them . 
Alas the Berlin wall came down to late for most and the Allies were not able to prevent the worst of the genocide against other by the German Nazi not only against Jews . 
Are we now to condemn these victims of tyranny to a similar fate as we sit on the side lines pontificating on how nasty war is and gee why don t they just sit down nicely and work it out ? 
If we lived in pacifist fairy land great idea but we do not and never have . 
So for those on the streets now of Africa and the Middle East bravely facing death unarmed or with comparatively less fire power than their rivals as in Libya . 
Do we once again forsake them because it is none of our business given they are other or do we realize finally we are as responsible for them and their families happiness as we are for our own ? 
One day soon we may search vainly the sky and horizon for release from heavy chains or imminent destruction of all we love and cherish . 
100 cruise missiles shot over the first day or two alone at a reported $ 700,000 a piece -LRB- $ 70 million dollars for the first day alone -RRB- a downed fighter jet I would imagine is somewhere between $ 15 - $ 22 million dollars for a total of $ 92 million dollars and that 's just for a few different types of equipment during the first few days the tip of the ice berg that is n't counting all money it costs to move aircraft carriers , battle ships , fuel and everything else involved with this silliness . 
To get some rebel fighters who no one knows who they are who appear to be hardcore muslim radicals -LRB- some interviewed said they did n't like Gaddafi because he was n't muslim enough -RRB- and may even have ties to al queda into power ? 
What a waste of American money , time and resources . 
Not good times for anyone any where in the world mostly brought on by greed around the world but at no time can any of us avoid an opportunity to support a democratic development where dictatorships have forever kept the world on edge and caste a dark shadow on human hope . 
As weary tired and broke as we can be . . 
We have to help those who are even more weary and tired of living but not living at all . 
What the hell happened to North Korea ? 
In Libya , the opposition has guns . 
In North Korea , the people are getting raped but are too brainwashed to realize . 
Kim Jong-Il is literally starving his people while eating food from his 5-star chef ! 
So let me get this straight . 
Most of Europe , and a good many Americans -- especially Obama -- decried our move to take out Saddam , but this is OK ? 
Aside from the fact that Saddam owned - and used - chemical weapons , could 've taught Gaddafi a thing or two about killing his own people , Iraq is strategically positioned on the border of Iran and the Persian gulf . 
What in the world will taking out Gaddafi do for us ? 
And besides , do the Western leaders really believe they can `` sort of '' make war ? 
The world has been feminized . 
Our leaders do n't have balls anymore -- and I 'm talking about the men ! 
We have a thing which the artist Mel Chin has represented in full size and it has allegedly been dropped on civilians . 
It is known as a Daisy Cutter , a ten-thousand pound bomb . 
Its name is a clue : it detonates above ground and for acres there will stand nothing taller than a Daisy . 
We target and murder people often , and while I do not approve and I believe it is counterproductive , why is a mass murdering dictator given diplomatic immunity ? 
Just one at his last known address would either finish the problem , or demoralize the survivors . 
One Daisy Cutter , not scattered strikes on private soldiers , would stop MoMo G. , and only two more would stop his sons . 
If Saddam ever had and used chemical weapons , and at one time he did , he got them from US Taxpayers . 
We bought them and gave them to him to use against Iran and the Kurds . 
We stripped him of these weapons before the eight year idiot war was started by bush . 
bush lied , and we still have billions a week expense doing it . 
We fund most of the dictators in the world . 
Democracy will break out eventually , in spite of our efforts . 
Daisy Cut MoMo and let Libya try to get some democracy . 
Who is going to pay for the wars ? 
We are already under water for national budget and also big deficit . 
I see no reason to pick up another `` easy '' war . 
This will not benefit the cotry a a whole only the military industry . 
By the way , congress did n't authorize the launch of airstike . 
It is against constitution .

2011-03-22,"By Gloria Borger , CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger : On one level , it made sense for France , Britain to take the lead She says Obama was seeking to de-emphasize U.S. role in Libya mission President has said Gadhafi must go , but U.N. resolution did n't call for regime change She says Obama has been vague on what the exit strategy is for the military intervention Editor 's note : Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN , appearing regularly on CNN 's `` The Situation Room , '' `` AC360 , '' `` John King , USA '' and `` State of the Union . '' 
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The story of the Libyan intervention may pain some of the most ardent believers in the proposition that it is America 's role to take the lead , all of the time , everywhere . 
But when the French and the British began the first sorties into Libyan airspace , it made an awful lot of sense : It 's their neighborhood after all . 
And when the Arab League decided to support some kind of allied intervention , it seemed a powerful consensus was developing . 
Then came the United Nations resolution , and the deal was sealed . 
Some complained that President Barack Obama had dithered and that it was too late for an effective no-fly zone . 
Others applauded his insistence on not going it alone . 
Put me in that camp : Without a strategic reason for unilateral U.S. military action , this is clearly a humanitarian effort . 
And a worldwide one . 
So if the president has done the right thing , why does it feel as if something is wrong ? 
It 's hard to pinpoint exactly , but there 's an amorphous and unsettling nature to this action . 
On the one hand , there is one coalition goal that has been explicitly stated and affirmed : This is an effort to keep Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi from murdering his own people . 
Yet there 's another goal here -- an implicit one -- that suddenly no one can explain in any great detail : Gadhafi has to go . 
It 's something the president himself said two weeks ago . 
And on Monday , he labored to separate his own words -LRB- as in , the end of the Gadhafi regime is `` U.S. policy '' -RRB- from the wording of the U.N. resolution -LRB- the humanitarian protection of the Libyan people -RRB- . 
In other words : We know the ouster of Gadhafi is part of the preferred endgame . 
But we ca n't make it part of the official coalition plan because regime change is nowhere in it . 
What are U.S. expectations for Libya ? 
How Americans feel about Libya The president has stated the obvious : The military operation is there to prevent a bloodbath . 
But we know that the military , political and financial pressure is also there to remove Gadhafi . 
So we understand the ultimate goal , but the coalition ca n't spell it out . 
Nor can we do it , exactly -- at least not as a stated goal . 
-LRB- And the generals were out in force over the weekend explaining that indeed , Gadhafi could potentially remain in power . -RRB- 
So we 're left with the prospect that once the rebels are no longer in danger of being overwhelmed by Gadhafi 's forces , we will then proceed to the `` tightening the noose '' phase of the operation that will finally lead to Gadhafi 's departure . 
And then there 's this : How do we know when we have succeeded ? 
How can we judge a humanitarian crisis averted ? 
Sure , we can tell when the danger to innocent civilians has abated -LRB- because we have destroyed or dismantled Gadhafi 's air capability -RRB- . 
But if the core of that danger is a murderous thug who still reigns , can you only abate it by removing him ? 
That 's where the strategy gets a tad circular : How can you ensure the end of the killing unless you get rid of the hideous man ordering it ? 
Richard Haass , the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and who is no fan of this intervention , tells me that America 's problem is an administration that is focused more on process than policy . 
`` This was based too much on getting support and not enough on a sustainable plan , '' he says . 
`` I do n't think we thought it through . 
Simply getting a coalition does n't mean it 's a good idea . 
Getting the Arab League does n't make it a good idea . 
Multilateralism does n't make the end better . '' 
In fact , it probably makes the intervention even more difficult to manage . 
In theory , the Obama doctrine -- which is clearly attempting to change the storyline of American military intervention in the Arab world -- is a game-changer . 
In a way , Barack Obama is still behaving as he did as the editor of the Harvard Law Review , hanging back until a center of gravity is established . 
But in the specific case of Libya , the caution can be confusing : Try as we might , there 's no way to keep American participation in any military action in the backseat , no matter who flies the first planes . 
There 's no way to ensure that any multilateral coalition works . 
And , most important : Is there a way to leave if Gadhafi stays ? 
And if we win -LRB- whatever that means -RRB- , who 's left ? 
Who are the Libyan rebels , if they are anything cohesive at all ? 
And what if the civil war flares up after we tamp it down ? 
Is that our problem ? 
Or some other country 's problem ? 
Clearly , the ambiguity is exactly what Obama was trying to avoid . 
Or if he does , he has n't told us about it .

2011-03-22,"CNN Student News - 3\/23\/11 Download PDF maps related to today 's show : THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . 
CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Not every rescue worker in Japan is human . 
We 've got a report coming up about rescue dogs and how they carry out their unique work . 
I 'm Carl Azuz . 
CNN Student News starts right now ! 
AZUZ : Things are getting more tense in the nearby country of Yemen . 
Protesters there have been calling for the president , Ali Abdullah Saleh , to step down . 
President Saleh made an offer to the people who are against him . 
He said he would step down , but at the beginning of next year . 
The opposition rejected that offer . 
That want Saleh out now . 
The protests have gotten violent at times , with government crackdowns leading to dozens of deaths . 
Because of that , some officials in President Saleh 's government are now supporting the opposition . 
And this was the scene at the Interior Ministry building in the Egyptian capital of Cairo on Tuesday . 
This fire broke out after a protest at the building earlier in the day . 
The protest was peaceful . 
People were calling for higher wages . 
They denied setting the fire , which was put out in less than an hour . 
BRIAN TODD , CNN CORRESPONDENT : With an energetic , hardwired bust , Atticus charges into the rubble , bouncing around a fallen roof . 
He 's focused on one thing : finding a living , breathing human amid the sprawling wreckage of the tsunami . 
It might seem an unfair request of a German shepherd , but Atticus and more than a dozen other dogs working with U.S. and British rescue teams here are more than equal to it . 
How important are these dogs to these operations ? 
ROB FURNISS , BRITISH CANINE SEARCH SPECIALIST : Very . 
There 's a lot of technical gear . 
Obviously , the listening devices , the cameras . 
There 's all that stuff , all that stuff for locating people . 
But at the end of the day , you ca n't beat a dog for hitting the scent of a human being . 
TODD : Like most canine specialists , Rob Furnace has a tight bond with his Border Collie Byron . 
TODD : The dogs are so highly trained , they 're able to block out the scent of a deceased person and pick up only on someone who 's alive . 
Their success rate is impressive . 
These teams pulled more than a dozen survivors safely from the rubble in Haiti , in no small part due to teammates like this German shepherd named Wracker . 
But keeping them sharp involves some creativity . 
The team just had to do a drill with Wracker because they have n't found anyone alive in a few days . 
They 've just had one of their own team members hide in this place , out of sight , just out of any sensory perception for Wracker . 
Sent Wracker in there to see if they could find that team member . 
That 's how they keep the dogs sharp if they have n't found anyone in a few days . 
You stare in amazement as they run full speed , jump , land and bounce off objects that are so jagged and uneven that most people could n't even attempt it . 
But they 're not invincible . 
Did he give you any kind of a signal or did you just see the blood ? 
TODD : Tomo , a German shepherd , snagged something in his paw . 
A little field surgery and he 's back in the game . 
Later on , Wracker needs more work to stitch up a wound . 
Never during either incident do we hear one whimper from either dog . 
TODD : Traveling , sleeping , eating and playing with their handlers is part of the routine . 
Their communication is so instinctive that they sometimes understand each other just by making eye contact . 
We did n't witness them finding survivors in Japan , but the dogs serve another purpose for those who 've lost everything . 
ELIZABETH KREITLER , FAIRFAX CANINE SEARCH SPECIALIST : Having the dog and seeing the times that the people in Haiti or something would enjoy a little solace from the dog , that 's also part of their job and helpful to everybody , to teammates and myself alike . 
TODD : All of these dogs actually live with their handlers , who are heavily involved in their training . 
That helps solidify the bond between them and helps them get through these long deployments a long way from home . 
Brian Todd , CNN , Unosumai , Japan . 
TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Golebiewski 's social studies classes at Northridge Middle School in Middlebury , Indiana ! 
The word `` vernal '' refers to what season ? 
You know what to do ! 
Is it : A -RRB- Winter , B -RRB- Spring , C -RRB- Summer or D -RRB- Fall ? 
You 've got three seconds -- GO ! 
Vernal comes from the Latin word for spring . 
That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! 
AZUZ : The vernal equinox occurs when day and night are equal lengths , and this happened Sunday night . 
That event marks the official start of spring . 
But depending on where you live , it does not mean you should start packing up your snow gear just yet . 
A winter storm brought snow and rain to California on Monday , leaving thousands of homes without power and closed some schools and roads . 
Every road into California 's Yosemite National Park was closed after storms dumped three-and-a-half feet of snow throughout the park . 
And in New Jersey , on the East Coast , some people spent the first full day of spring clearing sidewalks instead of hitting golf balls . 
AZUZ : As you might expect , the weather 's a little warmer down in Miami , Florida . 
Officials there are hoping some new outdoor facilities will let Floridians do more than just have fun in the sun . 
They want people to work out -- outside ! 
Men 's Health Magazine recently named Miami as America 's fattest city . 
Now , that is a reputation that city officials want to shed , so they 're installing these outdoor gyms in order to encourage people to get out and get in shape . 
If you ca n't afford a memership ? 
These outdoor facilities are totally free . 
And as you can see , some fitness fanatics are already putting them to good use . 
AZUZ : But what we 're curious about is this : Do you think it 'll work ? 
Some of the people in that video , you could tell it was n't their first time at a gym . 
But do you think these outdoor facilities would encourage folks who would n't normally work out to hit the equipment if it 's outside ? 
Head to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com and weigh in with your thoughts . 
AZUZ : An undefeated senior season . 
Anthony Robles is definitely an impressive athlete . 
He 's also an inspiration . 
Robles was born without a right leg . 
He 's never let that hold him back . 
He adapted his wrestling style , building the strength and size of his upper body into more than other wrestlers in his weight class . 
That style helped him win a national title recently . 
Robles says everyone faces some kind of adversity . 
The key is to stay focused . 
ANTHONY ROBLES , NCAA WRESTLING CHAMPION : Everybody has their own obstacles in their life , whether it be physical , mental , the outside world . 
Whatever it is , everybody experiences their own obstacles , and it 's about just looking beyond that , and really just focusing on your goals and going after them . 
AZUZ : Good insight . 
Before we go today , there 's a shuttle mission we 're talking to you about that 's never going to get off the ground . 
But it 's not supposed to . 
About 2,000 employees at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center got together to form this human shuttle in the parking lot . 
It 's a tribute to the space program , which is going away . 
Probably cost a lot less than an actual shuttle . 
It took about an hour . 
We sped the thing up so you could see how it all came together . 
It 's impressive that they found a spot to pull this off . 
AZUZ : But if there 's anything NASA 's good at , it 's finding space . 
We hope that you 'll find space for CNN Student News tomorrow , when we return . 
We will look forward to launching into more commercial-free headlines then .

2011-03-22,"By the CNN Wire Staff The images , taken in February and March , appear to show the destruction of a mosque in Zawiya , Libya . 
The source says they were taken a month apart The mosque served as a rebel command center Pro-Gadhafi forces retook Zawiya earlier this month -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Satellite images of a Libyan city , provided to CNN by an intelligence source , appear to show evidence that pro-Gadhafi forces razed a mosque that recently served as a rebel command center . 
The two images of an area of Zawiya , west of Tripoli , were taken February 20 and March 20 , according to the source , who provided them on condition of anonymity . 
In the first picture , a mosque can clearly be seen just south of Zawiya 's Martyrs ' Square , but in the later picture , the mosque is gone . 
The images , the source said , were released as part of the international effort to build pressure on Gadhafi and to illustrate what coalition members say are crimes against his own people . 
Pro- Gadhafi forces retook Zawiya this month after defeating rebel forces there . 
What are U.S. expectations for Libya ? 
CNN could not verify the authenticity of the images , nor when they were taken . 
The images were provided to CNN at a time when there is some wavering of support from within the Arab League for the coalition military effort . 
The image of a mosque that may have been destroyed by Gadhafi loyalists may provoke angst in the Arab and Muslim world . 
A CNN team that was in Zawiya both before and after government forces retook the city confirmed the mosque served as a makeshift clinic as well as a rallying point and command center for the resistance . 
The mosque was badly damaged during fighting to retake the city , the CNN team reported .

And what if the civil war flares up after we tamp it down ? 
Is that our problem ? 
Or some other country 's problem ? 
Clearly , the ambiguity is exactly what Obama was trying to avoid . 
Gadhafi is a brutal dictator , an international outlaw , and a sponsor of terrorism with gallons of American and other blood on his hands . 
Thus , to the question , is it in America 's vital interests to see Gadhafi go , the answer can only be `` yes . '' 
What could very well be worse than taking out Gadhafi now would be a surviving , embittered and emboldened Gadhafi dictator having survived and prevailed over another U.S. attack -- a hero-dictator willing to link up with other terrorist organizations or states set on attacking the United States and the West . 
The rest of the world is watching how we follow through with Libya . 
Leaving Gadhafi in power , yet again , will send precisely the wrong message to others in his league -- be they terrorist dictators in Iran or elsewhere . 
There is no question -- Col. Moammar Gadhafi is committing atrocious acts of violence against his own people . 
President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should be commended for working with the United Nations and our allies to shape a strong international response . 
With that said , I am very concerned that the president committed America 's military to operations in the region without true consultation with the Congress . 
Call this what they will , we are waging war -- while still engaged on two other fronts -- which will likely require substantial resources over a long period of time . 
Assuming the opposition forces are safe in Benghazi , then what must be done to protect civilians in those towns previously held by the opposition but have now been retaken by Gadhafi 's forces ? 
Presumably some U.N. presence must enter these areas and work to identify and protect civilians . 
This will likely be resisted by Gadhafi and could spur further conflict . 
Will the U.N. and the coalition be satisfied with a political stalemate on the ground , in which the eastern portion of the country achieves de facto and de jure independence ? 
The cease-fire called for in the resolution would seem to rule out any renewed offensive activity by the opposition . 
So unless there is some means to apply additional leverage , there may be two Libyas : one a vengeful dictatorship , the other a fledgling democracy needing long-term international protection . 
The head-snapping change in policy toward Libya has everyone guessing where the Mideast is heading , whether the U.S. has a good handle , and most of all , what President Obama is trying to achieve ... Will we be caught in increasing contradictions between our policy in Libya -LRB- crack down on an enemy government that kills demonstrators -RRB- vs. Bahrain and Yemen -LRB- go easy on a friendly government that kills demonstrators -RRB- ... The big question mark is the president himself . 
Rebounding from his electoral defeats last November , he seemed to be asserting a much firmer grasp on power , but in recent weeks , he appears to outsiders as someone who has slipped back into a haze of caution . 
The Economist this week is even questioning his political courage . 
As he sends U.S. troops into harm 's way , many in Washington are now waiting to see which Obama now emerges . 
Much rides on the outcome . 
The military intervention that President Obama authorized against Libya on Saturday -- eight years to the day after President George W. Bush announced the commencement of `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' -- is a quite different operation from the 2003 invasion of Iraq . 
Beyond the obvious difference that Obama has not authorized the use of U.S. ground forces in Libya , there are other differences to consider : First , the Obama administration was handed a gift by the Arab League , which in its more than six-decade history has garnered a well-earned reputation as a feckless talking shop , but unusually took a stand one week ago by endorsing a no-fly zone over Libya . 
The unexpected action by the Arab League gave the administration the impetus and diplomatic cover to then go to the United Nations Security Council to secure a broad resolution endorsing not only a no-fly zone , but also allowing member states to `` take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians in Libya . 
This is in contrast to George W. Bush 's ineffectual attempts to gather international support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . 
There was no U.N. resolution explicitly authorizing the use of military force against Hussein , and no Muslim countries participated in the American invasion and occupation of Iraq .

2011-03-22,"BEIJING\/NEW DELHI | Tue Mar 22 , 2011 9:11 am EDT BEIJING\/NEW DELHI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - China said on Tuesday that Western air strikes on Libya risked a `` humanitarian disaster , '' adding to the chorus of criticism from big emerging powers over the U.N.-authorized campaign . 
China , with Russia , India , Brazil and other developing countries have condemned the U.S.-led air strikes on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as risky and unwarranted overreaching by the West . 
The shared opposition to the Libya campaign could become a point of diplomatic convergence among the `` BRICS '' bloc of major emerging economies -- Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa -- which hold a summit in south China next month . 
But it is unlikely to evolve into united action by this disparate group of countries , with their own mutual rivalries , said Shi Yinhong , a professor of international security at Renmin University in Beijing . 
`` Undoubtedly , many developing countries see a dangerous precedent in the Western attacks and intervention -LRB- in Libya -RRB- in what is fundamentally a civil war , '' said Shi . 
`` But Russia , China and the others will be afraid of a serious break with the United States or offending the Arab countries , so they wo n't push their opposition far , '' he said . 
`` I think the idea that the BRIC countries would act as a coalition on this is outlandish . 
They are too deeply meshed with the West to risk a split , '' Shi added . 
Western powers began the strikes against Libya over the weekend in a U.N.-sanctioned campaign to target air defenses , enforce a no-fly zone and protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . 
India , China and Russia -- which , along with Brazil , abstained from last week 's U.N. Security Council resolution -- have a history of opposing intervention in sovereign states . 
They opposed the U.S.-led campaign over Kosovo in the 1990s , when the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was bombed , and also opposed the U.S. led invasion of Iraq . 
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , compared the campaign in Libya to the Iraq invasion , saying it `` resembles medieval calls for crusades . 
Brazil 's criticisms have been relatively muted . 
On Monday , it called for a ceasefire in Libya and regretted the loss of life there . 
Of the BRICS , only South Africa supported the U.N. Resolution . 
China has been among the loudest in voicing opposition . 
`` We have noted the reports about civilian casualties from the military action against Libya by the countries concerned , and we express our deep concern about this , '' the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a news conference in Beijing . 
`` The original intent of the -LRB- U.N. -RRB- Security Council resolution was to protect the security of the Libya 's people . 
We oppose the wanton use of armed force causing even more civilian casualties and an even bigger humanitarian disaster . '' 
She added that French President Nicolas Sarkozy , a strong proponent of the most vocal proponents of the no-fly zone over Libya , will visit China at the end of March to attend a seminar on global monetary reform . 
`` What is happening in a country , within their internal affairs , no external powers should interfere in it , '' Pranab Mukherjee , India 's finance minister and leader of the lower house of parliament , told lawmakers in New Delhi on Tuesday . 
`` Nobody , not a couple of countries , can take that decision to change a particular regime , '' Mukherjee said . 
The emerging powers could maintain their more united front over Libya in the coming weeks ahead of the BRICS summit in China , said Srinath Raghavan , a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi . 
`` If there is a serious ceasefire proposal or negotiated settlement , then the BRICS could well jump in diplomatically . 
They may want to then shape a global consensus if the West 's policies get in trouble , '' Raghavan said .

2011-03-22,"Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo at the presidential palace in Yamoussoukro , February 18 , 2010 . 
ABUJA | Tue Mar 22 , 2011 10:35 am EDT ABUJA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Nigeria 's foreign minister has accused the international community of double standards by imposing a no-fly zone to protect civilians in Libya while doing little to end abuses in crisis-torn Ivory Coast . 
Nigeria is the linchpin of West African bloc ECOWAS , which has threatened the use of force in Ivory Coast to push incumbent Laurent Gbagbo from power after he refused to accept defeat in an election the United Nations said rival Alassane Ouattara won . 
Around 400 Ivorians have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes since the disputed poll . 
Thousands of youth supporters of Gbagbo answered a call to join the army this week , adding fuel to fear that the violent power struggle risks sending the country back to civil war . 
Western powers , led by the U.S. , have in recent days launched air strikes and enforced a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians as the country 's leader Muammar Gaddafi fights a civil war against rebels trying to oust him from power . 
Speaking at the commissioning of a new foreign ministry building in the capital Abuja , Nigerian Foreign Minister Odein Ajumogobia said the contradictions were `` impossible to ignore '' . 
`` The contradictions between principle and national interest ... have enabled the international community to impose a no-fly zone over Libya ostensibly to protect innocent civilians from slaughter , but to watch seemingly helplessly -LRB- in Ivory Coast -RRB- as ... men , women and children are slaughtered in equally , even if less egregious violence , '' he said . 
The United States and the European Union have imposed travel bans and other sanctions on Gbagbo and his inner circle but West African nations will need to take a lead if there is to be any attempt to remove him by force , diplomats say . 
Ajumogobia said last month that any military intervention in Ivory Coast would need to be U.N.-led and was more likely to involve an aerial and naval blockade than deploying troops to its cities . 
African states have been at odds over the use of force since the crisis began . 
Nigeria and Sierra Leone see Gbagbo 's defiance as a risk to regional peace and efforts to nurture democracy . 
Other countries have publicly criticised the way in which the United Nations , African Union , ECOWAS and other Western nations quickly recognized Ouattara as victor . 
ECOWAS leaders are due to meet in Nigeria 's capital Abuja this week to discuss their next move in the Ivorian crisis . 
There have already been several mediation efforts .

Amid negotiations among allies about who will control the operation , Obama told a news conference with El Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes that `` I have absolutely no doubt '' that an agreement will be found soon . 
Obama spoke earlier in the day with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron and the White House said they agreed NATO should play an important role in enforcing the Libyan no-fly zone . 
Obama , facing questions at home about the Libyan mission , duration and cost , said the allies should be able to announce soon that they have achieved the objective of creating the no-fly zone . 
Pressed to outline the U.S. national security interests in Libya , Obama said the United States moved to support a U.N. Security Council resolution on Libya and avert a potential bloodbath after Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi warned he would show no mercy to people in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
Unless Gaddafi permits political reforms and `` unless he is willing to step down , '' the Libyan leader will present a potential threat to his people , said Obama . 
`` We will continue to support the efforts to protect the Libyan people . 
But we will not be in the lead , '' he said . 
Obama also said he believed the costs of the U.S. involvement in Libya will be factored into the Defense Department 's budget and will not present an added burden to Americans . 
`` At the end of the day , the American people are going to feel satisfied that lives were saved and people were helped , '' he said .

NEW : Officials invite journalists to tour damaged house , but ca n't find it Tripoli suburb of Tajura is struck , a government official says Coalition effort is not `` a land invasion , '' according to U.S. official Hospital patients and doctors paralyzed by fear Tune in to `` AC360 '' for the latest on the airstrikes in Libya . 
Watch `` AC360 '' at 10 p.m. ET Wednesday on CNN . 
Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The coalition air effort to halt the Libyan government 's attacks on civilians continued into Thursday for a sixth day , with an airstrike in the Tripoli suburb of Tajura , a government official said . 
On Wednesday night , the government reported that military and civilian locations in the neighborhood of Al-Jfara and in the Tagora district of the capital had been struck by `` crusading colonial '' bombardment . 
In response , Joint Task Force Operation Odyssey Dawn Lt. Cmdr. Jim Hoeft said in an e-mail to CNN , `` It is not likely that civilians were a part of any airstrike today . '' 
He said coalition forces `` have been using all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Libya from the violence and killing inflicted upon them by Colonel Gadhafi . '' 
An opposition activist in Tripoli accused state media of lying about civilian victims of the coalition airstrikes . 
For example , she said , she was accompanying a cousin to a hospital for medical care when she saw a TV producer asking some people to close their eyes and play dead and others to pretend they were wounded . 
Some of the `` wounded , '' she said , were soldiers in civilian garb . 
Rebels help rescue U.S. serviceman People appeared apprehensive , anxious . 
Opponents of Gadhafi were afraid to speak publicly . 
In Ajdabiya , parts of the city fell to opposition forces even though Gadhafi 's men , who had been pounding the area with artillery and heavy tank bombardments , retained control of the northern and western gates , opposition fighters and witnesses told CNN . 
A hospital staffer and opposition fighters said nine people were killed Wednesday in fighting near the northern gate . 
So far , the coalition has crippled the Libyan air force , and established a no-fly zone that spans Libya from east to west along its coastline , said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Gerard Hueber . 
Hueber , the chief of staff for U.S. operations said Wednesday that coalition planes had flown 175 sorties over Libya -- 113 of them by U.S. planes . 
But the coalition had no indication that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was complying with a United Nations mandate to stop attacks against civilians . 
On Wednesday , troops loyal to Gadhafi terrorized residents of the besieged rebel-held city of Misrata . 
One witness said Gadhafi 's forces had attacked the city 's main hospital , where 400 people -- about half of them patients -- were located . 
The push began at 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. ET -RRB- , when `` heavy tanks for Gadhafi troops start attacking the hospital -- the bombs falling here 20 meters -LRB- 66 feet -RRB- around us , '' said one person inside the hospital . 
He said two deaths had occurred `` around the hospital . '' 
At one point , shelling occurred without respite for 40 minutes , he said . 
`` Now , fortunately , no more shelling , but the situation is so serious that all the teams here -- the doctors , the patients -- are paralyzed , scared . '' 
He called for international intervention to protect the civilians inside the institution . 
`` Nobody can work here , '' he said . 
Ambulances were not able to leave the hospital , which had lost its electricity and was using generator power , he said . 
Coalition jets are using smart bombs to target mechanized forces and mobile surface-to-air missile sites and impede supply lines for their `` beans and bullets , '' Hueber said . 
The targets include Libya 's premier 32nd Brigade , commanded by one of Gadhafi 's sons and fully engaged in the fighting . 
`` It 's an extremely complex and difficult environment , '' Hueber said about going after forces in populated areas . 
Gadhafi : ` We will be victorious ' Santorum : Mission confusion in Libya Obama hopes Libyan rebels will organize Inside bombed Libyan military base `` And our primary focus is to interdict those forces before they enter the city ... cut off their lines of communication and cut off their command and control , '' he said . 
`` There have been no reports of civilian casualties . 
Our mission here is to protect the civilian populace and we choose our targets and plan our actions with that as our top priority . '' 
Wednesday night 's outbreak of violence broke a respite that began earlier in the day with the coalition attacks -- the first calm in a week , Misrata residents reported . 
`` We would like to express our gratitude to the international community since there were airstrikes this morning , '' said Mohammed , an opposition spokesman in the city who would identify himself only by his first name . 
Gadhafi 's forces had been stationed on the outskirts of the city , where they were providing support and supplies to loyalists fighting rebels in Misrata proper . 
Earlier in the day , grocery stores and other shops opened in the city , which is located two hours east of Tripoli and has been inaccessible to journalists . 
One person inside the hospital told CNN that five more people were killed in the last 24 hours , raising the death toll to at least 95 in the last seven days . 
A man who died Wednesday morning was shot by a sniper , the person said . 
Gen. Abdul Fatah Younis , a former interior minister who quit to lead opposition forces , said rebels have requested weapons from several nations to help the embattled city . 
`` Misrata is destroyed and they need weapons , '' Younis told CNN . 
`` We try to send them weapons , but of course they were all light weapons . 
There were no heavy weapons . '' 
Asked about the situation in Misrata , Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes said , `` We 're concerned about it , but I think you 're actually seeing some indications that the effort of the coalition is ... focused on Misrata and is having an effect there . '' 
The rapid advance of Libyan forces had been halted , particularly their move toward the nation 's second-largest city , Benghazi , Rhodes told reporters aboard Air Force One . 
Libya 's elite forces are drawn from tribes loyal to Gadhafi . 
Though they comprise no more than 10,000 men , those forces are on the offense , Hueber said . 
`` Those forces are fully-engaged in this conflict , that are attacking those civilian populations , '' he added . 
Though the rebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago , the Gadhafi forces have the upper edge , a U.S. official said . 
They remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively , the official said . 
Rhodes predicted the transition of command and control to another entity would be effected in `` a matter of days . '' 
NATO will likely play a key role in the command and control , he said , adding that he would not describe the conflict as `` an open-ended war , a land invasion in Libya . '' 
The international airstrikes against Libyan military positions began over the weekend after Gadhafi defied a United Nations-mandated cease-fire in attacks against civilians . 
The strikes are intended to help establish a no-fly zone . 
Sweden announced Wednesday it has frozen more than $ 1.53 billion in Libyan assets in response to EU sanctions imposed on the northern African country . 
France launched the air campaign in Libya and Britain and the United States followed . 
Germany is not participating in the military action , though it agrees with the United Nations resolution in principle , and moved Wednesday to ensure that its ships were far removed from the Libyan campaign . 
A German navy spokesman said Wednesday that all German ships previously under NATO command in the Mediterranean Sea were reassigned to operate under national command and are returning to previously scheduled port stops in Europe to await further instructions . 
German crew members of NATO fighter jets were also under German command . 
Britain has announced an international meeting for next Tuesday to assess the situation in Libya . 
The war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
The Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action . 
However , a Johns Hopkins University professor said the coalition can achieve only so much through aerial strikes . 
`` We have to understand the limits of what air power can do , '' Fouad Ajami told CNN 's `` AC360 . '' 
`` This is a recipe for a stalemate , '' he said . 
Criticism and questions persist about the international campaign , with no clear answer on who will take over command of the mission and what the exit strategy will be . 
U.S. President Barack Obama said the timetable for a transition of military leadership will be coming in days , not weeks . 
NATO said Wednesday it will decide shortly what its role in the operation will be . 
A spokesman added the alliance is well prepared . 
`` This is the bread and butter of NATO , '' an official said . 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has voiced his opposition to NATO taking political leadership over the Libya campaign . 
He suggested that a commission composed of foreign ministers from the participating states play that role . 
Ajami , however , said the Arab world would welcome NATO involvement . 
`` They know that the calamity is unfolding in Libya , and they know that no help is going to come other than from the West and from the United States . '' 
British Prime Minister David Cameron said Wednesday that Kuwait and Jordan have agreed to provide logistical support to the Libyan effort . 
Jordanian government spokesman Taher Edwan told CNN that Jordan 's role will be limited to a humanitarian one . 
`` Jordan did not and will not have any military participation in Libya , neither in planes or on the ground at all in Libya , '' he said . 
Qatar has already contributed planes to mission . 
The United Arab Emirates said Tuesday it will participate -- but only in providing humanitarian assistance . 
Toward that end , the country has sent a ship and two planes with basic relief supplies , the country 's news agency said .

2011-03-23,"By the CNN Wire Staff President gives an exclusive interview to CNN 's Spanish-language network Gadhafi could `` hunker down '' in the face of a no-fly zone , Obama concedes The president cites the humanitarian goals of the military mission San Salvador , El Salvador -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday expressed hope that Libya 's opposition movement , given new protection by a U.S.-led military mission , can organize itself to revive broad enthusiasm for political change and oust Moammar Gadhafi from power . 
In a 13-minute interview with CNN 's Spanish-language network , Obama said the immediate goal of the U.N.-sanctioned military mission that began Saturday was to prevent an onslaught of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi by Gadhafi 's military . 
`` Because the international community rallied , his troops have now pulled back from Benghazi , '' Obama said . 
Now the United States and its coalition partners , including NATO allies and Arab states , are establishing a no-fly zone over Libya , with U.S. forces taking out Gadhafi 's air defense systems , Obama said . 
He conceded that Gadhafi could `` hunker down and wait it out even in the face of a no-fly zone , even though his forces have been degraded . '' 
Obama hopes Libyan rebels will organize Obama on Libya : We have saved lives Gadhafi ` not backing down one-inch ' Critics : U.S. ca n't afford Libya mission `` Our hope is that the first thing that happens once we clear this space is that the rebels start discussing how they 're able to organize themselves , how they articulate their aspirations for the Libyan people , '' Obama said . 
`` Potentially what we may see is all the enthusiasm that the Libyan people had for a change in government that was occurring a few weeks ago , '' but was brutally repressed by Gadhafi , can now resurface , the president said . 
In particular , Obama said he hoped that the Libyan people decide it was time for a change that ends up sweeping Gadhafi from power . 
The president acknowledged the irony of being a Nobel Peace Prize winner who ordered the U.S. military into action on the eight anniversary of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq , but said the goal in this case was humanitarian . 
`` I 'm accustomed to this contradiction of being both a commander-in-chief but also somebody who aspires to peace , '' Obama said , adding the Libya mission was to protect the Libyan people from Gadhafi 's military . 
`` We 're not invading a country ; we are not acting alone , '' he said . 
`` We are acting under a mandate issued by the U.N. Security Council . '' 
The American people will see no contradiction between someone who believes in peace and `` who wants to make sure people are n't butchered because of a dictator who wants to cling to power , `` Obama added . 
Speaking in El Salvador on the final leg of a three-nation Latin American trip that included stops in Brazil and Chile , Obama also cited what he called a new relationship between the United States and the region to the south . 
He noted that an area once known for dictatorships and coups now featured democratic governments that were less focused on political ideology and more focused on results in helping their people . 
`` That 's the kind of partner we want , '' Obama said , describing the relationship as a `` two-way street '' based on mutual respect , interests and trust , rather than the old model of underdeveloped nations approaching the United States with `` hat in hand . '' 
Asked about immigration reform back home , Obama said he would again make the push for a comprehensive bill . 
`` I 'm going to need some help , '' he said . 
`` I can get the majority of Democrats to support it . 
I need some help from Republicans . '' 
With last year 's census results showing a growing Hispanic population in the United States , Obama said Republicans will have a hard time winning future elections if they focus on anti-immigration sentiment . 
"
2011-03-23,"Defense Secretary Robert Gates - who is refreshingly open and honest - said : `` We have n't done something like this , kind of on the fly before . '' 
He was talking about the coalition attacks on Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in Libya , why the United States was still in control , why tensions are rising among members of the coalition , why there 's no plan for any group or nation to take the lead . 
The allies , you see , are n't getting along so well . 
In fact , there are reports today that the coalition is falling apart . 
France yesterday suggested a committee be formed - outside of NATO - to oversee the military operations . 
It would be a political steering committee and would include members of the Arab League . 
See if a committee is running the war , no one has to take responsibility if things go to hell and everyone can take credit if they go well . 
The French were early backers of the no-fly zone and were the first nation to launch airstrikes against Libya on Saturday . 
The Italians have accused the French of not originally backing a NATO-run operation to be in a better position for oil contracts when a new government is established in Libya . 
It 's not just the French causing problems Russia 's defense minister yesterday called for a cease-fire in Libya . 
Germany today pulled its naval ships out of NATO operations in the Mediterranean over a disagreement over the Libyan campaign 's direction . 
It 's not pretty . 
Foreign ministers from Western coalition partners will meet in London Tuesday along with members of the Arab League and the African Union to see what can be done . 
Here s my question to you : France wants a committee to run the war in Libya . 
Is that a good idea ? 
Interested to know which ones made it on air ? 
Yes , I think it is a good idea . 
Handing command over to Allied forces shows solidarity . 
Let the allies figure this one out for a a change . 
Hopefully they will decide to drop a missile on Gadhafi himself so this thing will come to a swift end . 
You 've got to be kidding . 
A camel is a horse designed by a committee . 
This won t come out as good . 
We 've done our part . 
We should tell the coalition they have 48 hrs to take over and then we 're gone , whether they have something in place or not . 
This is the first conflict in recent memory where no one has a plan , everyone is passing the buck , no one knows the players and no one knows the end-game . 
All we know for certain is that we have wasted a vast amount of expensive cruise missiles . 
The replacement costs are extraordinarily high and this approach depletes our stockpile . 
Where is the sense in this approach ? 
I 'm all for propping up democracies , supporting freedom and liberty , but where is the plan ? 
Jack , how many people have to die before the coalition gets rid of the problem in Libya , whether accidentally or purposely ? 
Gadhafi must go , hopefully sooner than later . 
Maje in Vancouver , British Columbia : It 's a great idea if you want to see the Odyssey Dawn crew out-daffy Gadhafi ! 
I can see it all now : Inspector Clouseau draws up the battle plans and Mr. Bean leads Larry , Moe and Curly in the charge . 
And the wacky Libyan colonel dies laughing . 
I worked with an American subsidiary of a French company for fifteen years , and this is so typical , not just of the French , but of the Europeans in general . 
This is a bad , bad , bad idea . 
Define the objective , put an American in charge , and Get ' r done . 
As long as we get to move out and let others have control , with little to no involvement , sounds good to me ... committee away ! 
Fantastic idea as long as they do n't use assets\/resources from the United States . 
Its amazing how many good ideas come to light when another country -LRB- s -RRB- is footing the bill . 
The United Nations is a good example as all of their projects are either partially or fully funded by the west . 
Jack : Leadership by committee is not a good idea . 
Its lead , follow , or get the hell out of the way . 
The military lives and works by a chain of command or commanders to accomplish a common purpose mission . 
The idea of leadership by committee reminds me of the United States Senate where there are alot of ideas , but little is accomplished . 
The military needs one action commander not a committee . 
March 23 , 2011 at 1:46 pm | If the committee is Obama style , a gathering of the best expertise from war departments and State Departments , yes that 's fine , but a la Obama there must be a Chairperson who synthesizes the committee 's determinations . 
March 23 , 2011 at 1:54 pm | I hope so americans are war sick . 
We cannt stop every bad guy . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:06 pm | I think we should just let France run it , and back out entirely now . 
We do n't need to get involved in another open-ended costly boondoggle , especially when we do n't know what kind of people we 'd be helping replace Khaddafi . 
They could be Islamic radicals for all we know . 
It 's very unlikely they 'll create a Western-style secular democracy , though . 
And since Republicans in Congress refuse to raise taxes , I 'd hate to have to explain to Grandma that they 're going to cut her Social Security check to pay for this . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:11 pm | Nothing of that magnitude can succeed without an intelligent Committee from all the countries issuing orders . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | Good for France , but bad for military action . 
I have a better idea , let the French take the lead and see whether they 've learned their lessons from Viet Nam and Algeria . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | If having a committee run the war in Libya means not putting a western label on the war then it 's a good idea . 
It is time for the United States to take a backseat . 
We have already bitten off more than we can chew by being involved in two wars . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | Yes , that way the US will not have to take all the blame for the action taken . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | Yes , I think it is a good idea . 
Handing command over to Allied forces shows soloidarity . 
Let the allies figure this one out for a a change . 
Hopefully they will decide to drop a missile on Gadafy himself so this thing will come to a swift end . 
Saving more lives , time and money . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:33 pm | It 's a great idea if you want to see the Odyssey Dawn crew out-daffy Ghadafi ! 
I can see it all now : Inspector Clouseau draws up the battle plans and Mr. Bean leads Larry , Moe and Curly in the charge . 
And the whacky Libyan colonel dies laughing . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | Committees do not make executive decisions . 
They debate and debate like the UN , then pass resolutions . 
This is a baaaad idea . 
Now you know why U.S. leadership is indispensable . 
Without it , the rest of the world is confused and lost . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | Oh great -- that is just what we need . 
We ca n't get things right when we run the war now we need a committee -- let France deal with it . 
Throughout history war conducted by a committee will almost always end in disaster ! 
One of the principles of war that has been taught since the days of Clausewitz is `` Unity of Command . '' 
Only ONE person is in charge of a military operation if you want a chance to be successful . 
March 23 , 2011 at 2:54 pm | What 's next , going to the U.N. to ask permission to raise taxes ?? Worldwide leadership has reached an all time low . 
Washington , Churchill , and Eisenhower must be rolling over in their graves . 
March 23 , 2011 at 3:02 pm | We do n't need a committe to run the war in libya . 
We need a committe to end the war in libya , iraq , afghanistan , and pakistan . 
Time to stop the bombings , killings , and assasinations of people in other countries we do n't like . 
The entire defense and supplemental war budget is borrowed money . 
Gaddafi blew up one plane , the u.s. has blow up thousands of planes , and buildings . 
The u.s. military killed a million people in iraq , nuked hundreds of thousands of japanese civilians with 2 nuclear bombs and yet we have the nerve to call gadaffi a mad man . 
The rebels in libya drew first blood so it is their mess to clean up not some french fry committee . 
March 23 , 2011 at 3:03 pm | John Moore - New Britain , PA It is well proven that a committee can not run anything . 
Just as there can only be one chef -LRB- french for chief -RRB- in the kitchen there has to be a visible leader for this Libyan campaign . 
March 23 , 2011 at 3:07 pm | Good idea as long it is not the U.S. leading , late France and the U.K. lead it is there OIL ! 
It does n't matter , a committe or take turns , it should be an easy mission that does not take a rocket scientist to figure a strategy to check Khadafy . 
Its seems like its only the people out for a political game thats trying to muddy the waters . 
March 23 , 2011 at 3:13 pm | Committee to do what ? 
The only thing that needs to be done is to Remove the tyrant from office Dead or Alive ! 
March 23 , 2011 at 3:19 pm | I can just imagine what a guy like General George Patton would think of an idea like that : A committee Jack , A COMMITTEE - Not on your life . 
If a committee had been running the war in Europe 67 years ago , Paris would still be in Nazi hands and the French would be speaking German . 
No wonder France has n't won a war in over a hundred years . 
Could France also have a commitee run a war in Ruwanda , Darfur , Congo , Uganda , Ethiopia , Somalia , Zimbabwe , Togo , Burundi , Liberia , Botswana , Colombia , Afghanistan , Palestine , after all they civilian massacres everyday ... , ah , maybe they dont have that much Oil to share with France , does really France care about Libyan civilians ? 
Mike from NYC March 23 , 2011 at 3:31 pm | Of course it 's a good idea . 
NATO has worked together for more than a half century . 
There are decent and capable people in every chair . 
Let the America Firsters go to work building a wall around the country and begin on the part that extends westward from Southern California to surround Hawaii . 
I 'll buy the scuba gear , but no air tanks . 
France wants a committee to run the war in Libya . 
Is that a good idea ? 
Sounds to me like France just expected the US to take the lead and they were sadly mistaken . 
So instead of taking the lead they pass it off on others . 
So typical , no one wants to take responsibility for anything these days . 
The only one who laid it out as it is was President Obama , . 
He told the world that this was not our `` war '' that we were only in a supporting role and would not take the lead . 
I believe we just let France run the entire war and bring all of our troops home . 
This entire issue is just another way to stimulate the economy and take peoples mind off of the real issues in America , jobs and education . 
March 23 , 2011 at 3:38 pm | Cliff Glass - Rego Park , New York What a novel concept . 
Allies equally sharing cost , risk , and responsibility for a global military action . 
Neocons , take cover , American exceptionalism is definitely under attack . 
March 23 , 2011 at 3:53 pm | If you want to see the results of committee rule look at the U.N. Security Council . 
If that does n't scare you check out the NATO Council of Ministers . 
Both are great examples of cowardice and ineptitude . 
If there is a concil running the show I hope we pull out completely . 
March 23 , 2011 at 3:56 pm | As long as we get to move out and let others have control , with little to no involvement , sounds good to me ... committee away ! 
March 23 , 2011 at 3:59 pm | Excuse my confusion , Jack , but are we , along with France et al , `` at war '' with Libya ? 
Did I miss the declaration of war on Libya by Congress and Obama ? 
If indeed we are in another Mid-East war , then we should not be debating who should `` run '' the war and quickly and completely crush the Libyan army and its commander in chief , Gadhafi without debate or hesitation . 
Either we are at war or we are not . 
To play politics with our troops , Libya 's people without total commitment is a crime in itself . 
Either commit to war and victory or get the hell out . 
Gadhafi and his army should have been history by now if we were committed to doing so . 
Are we indeed at war with Libya , Jack ? 
If you want an issue to be killed , all you have to do is assign it to a committee . 
They will kick it around until it changes shape so bad that you ca n't recognize the original issue . 
Most committees ca n't control themselve let along assignments\/issues assigned to them . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:04 pm | We have plenty of committees in this country and they ca n't get anything done efficiently . 
So yeah running a war in Libya by committee should be great . 
Can only imagine how messy this will be in a couple months . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | Joe Ft Walton Bch Fl It is a very good idea , if they all decide to take him down . 
Gaddafi got to go now , if not what have we accomplish . ? 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | Why not what a great idea work as a team something the USA lost long ago by the outsource idea that now seems to have been to optimistic to say the least . 
Any large project should work as a committee otherwise known as a team . 
I think the `` team '' should go for it . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:13 pm | Skarkosy wanted this thing to increase his political clout in an upcoming election . 
If he wants to cash in on the glory , he should do the heavy lifting . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Only if the committee does not include us let the rest of the world handle Libya . 
We have no real interest there but France does , so let them do the heavy lifting for once . 
I m tired of fighting everyone else s battles for them . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:26 pm | Dee in New Paris Ohio Do you mean that France wants the U.S. to commit to helping them run the war in Libya ? 
Or do you mean that FRANCE wants to commit to running the war but wants all the other nations that signed on o commit ? 
Anyway , what I want to know is , between France , the U.S. , and all the other U.N. nations who are willing to help get rid of Gadhafi , what 's the holdup ? 
How can it be that Libya has not already been conquered and the despot got rid of ? 
It does not give one a lot of confidence in the ability of the allies if between them they have not accomplished their goal . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | What doesFrance want ? 
A committe of Western coalisions , a committe of Arab c ountries , or a combination of those ? 
We are already talking about war . 
Where it is going to end is every ones guess . 
The only solution , of course , would be to catch the dictator , a sly and cruel fox , and cookoo to boot . 
The International court will be impatiently waiting to get its hands on the man . 
The U.N contract ONLY has issued the R2P -LRB- Resolution to Protect -RRB- Even that may prove extremely difficult to do without `` collateral damage '' . 
I have a feeling that the President has been co-erced in taking a military roll in this adventure . 
The U.S.A. should have stayed OUT of it , lest it will later be pilloried by the Arabs who found some fault in the countries engament . 
, something THEY should have wanting to tackle . 
Unfortunately they dislike each other more than anybody else . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:37 pm | What war or even what military action was ever successfully commanded by a committee ? 
What is needed is another Eisenhower . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:39 pm | A war run by committee ? 
If people think the `` plan '' is cockeyed now , give the `` committee '' a chance . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:53 pm | Well , since the only person from the United States who has demonstrated ANY leadership whatsoever during this war is President , Hillary Clinton , perhaps a `` committe '' is the solution to this whole mess ! 
I wonder , which community organizer suggested the creation of a committie ? 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:58 pm | This kind of stuff is the reason you have your ducks in a row before you act . 
But no , a committee is a terrible idea . 
You ever want to see how effective committees are , take a look at any government . 
March 23 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | Looks like we have a `` food fight '' going on in Europe . 
Forming a commitee-sounds like our Congress in action . 
Gadhafi is probably laughing inside his bunker . 
Meanwhile Russia and China are sounding `` high and mighty . '' 
If this is the `` new world order '' , I do n't think I want to be part of it . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:01 pm | Well , why not ! 
war is a business , kind of like congress is . 
Why not run it like one ? 
We can have committees , subcommittees , committee chairpersons , secretaries who secretly run things , vice-president of important stuff , keeper of the keys , bullet managers ... well , you get my drift ! 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Yes , it is a wonderful idea . 
The United States has proven its bravery , courage , and resolve time and time again . 
We have nothing left to prove . 
It makes since both financially and politically . 
Financially , it is time other countries help foot the bill when we are called on to stop a dictator from mass murdering his own people . 
Politically , it lets the world know we are not the only ones sick and tired of these murderous thugs committing genocide . 
We do n't need any more PR . 
As Ann Landers used to say , `` it is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and prove it . '' 
Absolutely !! Hold a meeting , form a committee , anything to make it look like someone is doing something to justify transferring money from the taxpayers into corporate coffers . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:13 pm | Fabulous idea . 
Let France do it for a change . 
Time for America to stay out of other countries that hate us anyway . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Yes , it is a wonderful idea . 
The United States has proven its bravery , courage , and resolve time and time again . 
We have nothing left to prove . 
It makes since both financially and politically .

As Ann Landers used to say , `` it is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and prove it . '' 
P.S. I also like Wolf 's idea of withholding Lybian funds to pay for our involvement in this fray . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Sure . 
France has such an outstanding record in military actions in the past couple of centuries . 
Let 's listen to them on matters military . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Rather than a `` committee '' how about a bureau ? 
We can call it the `` Bureau of Misplaced Priorities . '' 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | It is a great idea . 
This operation would n't have begun without France and the French have the most interest in Libya . 
US has little interest in being involved and it gives them an easy exit strategy to let others lead . 
If France wants to take the ball , let them have it . 
No one else does . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | of course its not !!! the military although it may defend democracy is not one itself . 
there are decisions which must be made immediately and you just cant do that with a fractured committee . 
peoples lives depend on quick action and ive never seen a committee that was able to do that . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I think it is a good Idea since the US does n't have it 's house in order , maybe some other country will do a better job . 
Maybe a country that is n't into debt `` clear up to it 's eyeballs '' would be a good choice for the leadership role . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Yes Jack By all means put the French in charge . 
They have a long history of surrenders and defeats . 
In no time at all The Colonel will be drinking French wine while his body guards shop in Paris . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I dont know if that would work . 
We seem to be close to pulling out and the French are becoming . . 
well , the French to be honest . 
Why would Russia even speak out about this ? 
They abstained from the vote when they could have voted against it . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | If France suggested it , I would be against it automatically . 
When did France ever do anything that smelled anything like success , since Napoleon 's time , as far as war efforts are concerned ? 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Yes . 
This committee is called the United Nations and I am grateful that America is now supporting the vision of a strong United Nations . 
Please stop over-analyzing this no-fly zone , the immediate purpose is to save Libyan citizens from being slaughtered by a dictator . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Sure Jack , a committee sounds like a wonderful idea . 
Let 's put a committee in charge where people can talk for days and no actual action be taken . 
There 's a reason why the military does n't use committees . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Remo , from beautiful downtown Pflugerville Texas Jack , you 've got to wacth the French , they 'll want to surrender to Libya next . 
Well that has been their history . 
We should n't have stuck our necks in there in the first place . 
And we are there in an illegal manner . 
For a president who `` boasts doing thing right '' , he sure as hell tends to do the opposite . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | How French ! 
No wonder they have n't won a war in forever . 
Someone has to be in charge -- whether in the newsroom or the battlefield . 
-LRB- I 'm a retired US Military officer who studied at the French Army Staff School in France and worked at our Embassy in Paris . 
I can assure you this is a ` political ' statement and did not originate from French Military officers . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Wow ! 
I worked with an American subsidiary of a French company for fifteen years , and this is so typical , not just of the French , but of the Europeans in general . 
This is a bad , bad , bad idea . 
Define the objective , put an American in charge , and Get ' r done . 
A Committee !!!!!!!! You 've got to be kidding . 
A camel is a horse designed by a committee . 
This won come out as good . 
We 've done our part . 
We should tell the coalition they have 48 hrs to take over and then we 're gone , whether they have somthing in place or not was n't it the Frech who we bailed out in WWI ? 
Was n't it the French who insisted on the war reparations that set up Hitler 's rise to power ? 
Was n't it the French -LRB- Le Grand Charles -RRB- who were angry that we prevented new war reparations after WWII ? 
Then there was Dien Bein Phou . 
Obama better read some history and take charge ! 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Absolutely . 
The question is , is the US going in as a bully oil mogul\/occupier or to help democratically minded people set up a democracy . 
It 's best if we sit equally at the table with everyone else and abide by the opinion of consensus . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | This sandbox is the result of a President who has ZERO military experience . 
Come on folks -- when are we going to start requiring prior military service for the Office of Presidency ? 
It 's just common sense . 
Then again , we have n't seen much of that in quite some time now from any party ... March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Let 's form a committee of intelligent military men and put Hillary Clinton in charge of all . 
She seems to be the only one in office that is where she 's supposed to be . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | It 's ok with me , Jack - as long as the US is not on the committee and we get the heck out of Libya and the other places we do n't belong . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | A committee o run this `` war '' in Libya would be a fantastic idea , as long as the United States does n't try and run it . 
Its about time that someone else step up to the challenge of trying to be World Peace Keeper ! 
But if they need the muscle the US wont be too far behind ! 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | CNN Jack Cafferty : France wants committee to run war in Libya . 
Jct : Under Khadafi , Libyans were burdened with no taxes , free health care , free education at home and abroad , lots to be rebelling against . 
I have no doubt the Committee will be able to `` raise '' them to the same standard of living as in the US . 
Har har har har har . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Here we go again . 
I remember we went into Vietnam to help the French and once we did that , they promptly backed out leaving the US holding the proverbial bag Remember , history does repeat itself . 
First the UAE is MIA , now the collation is fracturing apart . 
So do we enter war # 4 ??? A no fly zone will Not oust Qaddafi from power . 
Qaddafi s ground forces are superior to the poorly equipped freedom-fighters which means there will ultimately be boots on the ground and now the question would be whose boots ? 
Which country will ultimately send in ground troops ? 
I vote NO American ground Military ! 
Enough is enough !! March 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Jack , excluding every previous committee ever set up , how many have failed ? 
The very idea a bunch of French bureaucrats can win a war is absurd . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | If it 's a committee , how about calling it a `` C.R.I.M.E. '' - Committee Rationalizing Infiltrating Moammar 's Empire . 
First , why did we let the French pull our strings ? 
What have we ever learned from the French , accept how to lose ? 
NATO has to step forward and take the lead regardless of what others say . 
The Arab leagues that supported this U. N. resolution , needs to put up or shut up . 
They are just to worried about the backlash , but really do not want to defend the freedom that all humans seek . 
NATO has a chain of command , they need to use it , that is why we have NATO . 
People are dieing while the world including the U.S plays in politics . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Sounds like France has never read `` The Art of War '' by Sun Tzu . 
One leader at the top -LRB- with advisors , but one leader is the only effective way to approach conflict . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | French is in favor of running everything with commitees . 
Which is excellent way of screwing a war effort beswides anything else . 
Reminds me of a joke : What is a Camel ? 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Establishing a committee shows how disorganised this coalition forces are . 
A no-fly zone headed by a committe , will have no effect . 
Gadaffi stands a good chance of winning this battle because he has shown leadership , and those trying to remove him , lack a clear vision . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Regarding the recommendation for a committee to run the war . 
It should be a select group of Senators and Reps. My reason for suggesting this is that it would cost billions of dollars , take forever and six months , the war would be over by then which is okay since any plan these dolts come up with would n't work anyway March 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Look at how politicians are running our government and then try to convience me that committee members from different nations can run a war like campaign . 
Moammar Gadhafi would probably die of old age before a committee would come to a concensus on the campaing . 
You know how politicians work together . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | No a good idea . 
President `` George W. '' Sarkozy of France is having a problem with re-election next year . 
He is trying to prop up his approval rating in France by being a cowboy . 
Why should we engage in a civil war in Libya ? 
Unlike Sadam , Gadafy is a appeaser of the West . 
Should we pull him down and replace by an Islamic alternative government , an Islam Republic of Libya ? 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | It has been said that a horse is a camel built by committee . 
Suddenly the GOP wants answers about military actions ; funny they were n't so curious when furious George B. went to war because of his beliefs and false rumors . 
We need to finish the job and take Gadafhi out ! 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | No one to blame if things go wrong . 
No one is responsible if things go right . 
Sounds like a win -- win to me ! 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | No. . 
The U.N. has had more than a half century worth of experience dealing with these kind of problems . 
Will the committee handle the financing , logistics and take responsibility for civilian or other losses ? 
We have started a humanitarian effort to help the people in Libya as well as try to settle the unrest in the area to try and quell the speculators desire to raise oil prices . 
Which is in the U.S. 's and worlds best interest . 
This is a civil war in Libya . 
We have leveled the playing field and now it is up to the Libyans and their neighbors to fight for their Democracy and change ... March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | If the `` politicians would turn over the war to the warriors like Pres. Bush did in the first gulf war , this one would be over with by now . 
Politics do n't win wars , they just prolong them March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | It 's just another attempt by France to be politically safe at all costs . 
I ca n't remember the last time France had a `` good '' idea . 
It was France 's idea to warn Ghadafi when the U.S. tried to cut the head off of this snake more than 20 years ago . 
We should push France out of the equation altogether , since they have protected him in the past , and hand leadership to a country that has the least to gain from the whole situation , This would attempt to gain some form of political neutrality in the military decision making . 
Political and military decision making never go well together . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | No , this was France 's idea in the beginning . 
It was politicking all around . 
France just wants oil as usual and they will benefit from this the most this is why they convinced Hillary to convince obama to say yes to this crap . 
No one should ever trust the French when it comes to wars , did n't they abandon us in iraq when they realized people would die ? 
The French are only good at retreating . . 
punks the whole lot ! 
Also CNN stop telling Obama\/what to do and outlining his agenda for him he is a grown man he knows what he is about . 
He talked to congressional leaders and now the tan man is having selective amnesia about it . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | A committee is always a good idea because a smaller group can accomplish more by coming into agreement quicker . 
If we get all countries on board with a committee then tensions will ease because everyone will feel like they are part of the oversight of this endeavor . 
This is new , but if other countries contribute resources then its a good thing . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Absolutely a good idea . 
I love my country and respect the presidency , but this jerk and the last jerk attacked countries who did n't first attack us . 
We are supposed to believe in democracy , but it is not democratic to believe you can speak for other countries . 
Plus Obama needs to be more thoughtful of the American people whom he 's helping Bush bankrupt . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Nurse Lisa in Shelton CT Sure France -- compile a committee . 
Hoping the US will not be on the committee nor footing any part of the financial burden of their efforts . 
Was mad about last weeks magical announcement about Daffy 's involvement in terrorist activities of the past -- like we did n't have this intel for yrs . 
The public never gets the truth , just the bills . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Since everyone seems to think having Arab backing is needed , then I do n't see a better approach than the committee . 
If we had consulted with Congress before deploying the no-fly zone then we would not have needed the committee because the opposition forces would all be dead by now . 
There is a reason why the President is the Commander-in-Chief and not the Congress . 
So , France wants a committee to run the war in Libya . 
My only concern is that the US Congress might be involved in some way , shape or form . 
If that happens ... all is lost . 
If those bickering boneheads can be sidestepped ... hey , we just might see something work for a change . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Everything is a bad idea , Jack . 
There are no solutions . 
They need dictators to function . 
They know no other way . 
But , where was Speaker Boehner -LRB- or however you spell his name -RRB- when the U.S. basically unilaterally launched a full scale war and occupation to follow on a country that did n't have anything to with anything ? 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | That is not an excellent idea . 
We already have too many organizations . 
It will just lead to the already economic problems we face in this world today . 
We will see more bloodshed in this world . 
Why are we not making more organizations for world peace ? 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | Why does Committee almost rhyme with dither . 
Committe also means that US forces will be commanded by nations that do n't care to much for us-The French among the others in the EU . 
I usually support Obama , yet this time he is foolish in not wanting to appear imperialistic . 
The timid cringe and make deals ; those that `` CAN DO '' make the rules and lead their lessers . 
The US is the only democracy in the coalition . 
Only the US has a First Amendment . 
So we also `` KNOW HOW '' . 
fn : US troops were under the UN command in Somalia ; That turned out really good ! 
Jack , we should n't be there at all ! 
We keep removing dictaters from power and destablizing the region I only want their Oil . 
I do n't care about them at all . 
Jack From Nice , Ca . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | If the strategy is anything other than get in , destroy all Libyan air forces and military vehicles where civilians are being slaughtered , and get out , then the coalition should disband . 
For people to even think about who gets oil from Libya at a time like this is beyond disgusting . 
I hate high gas prices , but I also ca n't stand those who look to profit because of others ' suffering . 
Are they actually thinking , these women and children are being slaughtered , but hey , at least I can make a few million dollars by getting first dibs on their oil ? 
If so , then we need to come up with a vaccine to protect the world from such ignorance . 
Ghadafi could be killed at any time with special forces , so no military action is needed to unseat him . 
Ghadafi is over confident and seems to think that he is immortal . 
He is a perfect target . 
He will soon realize that he is a spec and that his legacy is worthless . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | A committee ???? What is this ? 
Maybe it 's a good idea . 
We could abstain from every motion put forward . 
What happens if we do n't have a quorum ? 
They say that it was a committee that created the camel when they were trying to create a horse . 
` nuff said March 23 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Committee ? 
Your kidding me more . 
I am surprised they have not surrendered to Libya yet ... Someone is always in charge of a committee . 
So who chairs the committee ? 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Absolutely a good idea . 
I love my country and respect the presidency , but this and the last president attacked countries who did n't attack us . 
We are supposed to believe in democracy , but it is not democratic to believe you can speak for other countries . 
Plus Obama needs to be more thoughtful of the American people whom he 's helping Bush bankrupt . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | When you say , `` It 's not just the French causing problems ... '' and then you state `` Russia 's defense minister yesterday called for a cease-fire in Libya , '' are you stating that steps towards peace only cause problems ? 
How is a cease-fire a bad thing ? 
Is this what a committee is needed to discuss , what is a peaceful move and a war-mongering move ? 
Also , with Germany not agreeing with the way Libya is being handled , how are they causing trouble by protecting their citizens and military by not involving them in a dispute that they have nothing to do with ? 
Did Libya do anything to Germany ? 
I have n't seen anything to hint this . 
Did Libya do anything to the U.S. ? 
I have n't heard anything to hint this either . 
Alliances only drag countries into conflicts in which they had nothing to do with originally . 
`` Peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations -- entangling alliances with none . '' 
~ Thomas Jefferson But why would we want peace , commerce , and honest friendship ? 
We would n't have any real reasons to go kill and flex our military muscle then , because that solves everything all the time . 
So , no , a committee to run the `` war '' in Libya is a bad idea , just like it was stated , '' ... if a committee is running the war , no one has to take responsibility if things go to hell and everyone can take credit if they go well . '' 
We should know this already by the countless committees in our own Congress and how no one jumps at the opportunity to take responsibility when things go wrong . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | Oh good . 
I 'll hold my breath waiting for that to work out well for everyone concerned . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | A committee has to have a leader and hopefully parties who desire to work together a for a common goal . 
THis bunch ca n't agree on anything for more than a day or two ? 
We did our part , now either go get Gadaffi without all the baloney from these other clowns or lets go home ? 
We have paid the bulk of this so far and Europe are the one 's who really need this mess cleaned up . 
Geez , is our leadership dumb otr what I think ignoring too many other of our own problems while trying to conceal our very serious financial issues to the rest of the world by appearing strong is laughable . 
Sounds like another money laundering scandal in the making . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | France and England wanted to get Gaddaffi and did a lot of tough talk b\/4 this started . 
Why do n't they put their troops in there for a clean up and bring this to a close ? 
We have done enough I think . 
France needs some kind of leadership or steering committee when it comes to military action , but not us . 
Usually they need someone to fight for them since their rifles have all been dropped a time or two . 
We have the green light now so use it , and let the US make Kadafi want to join the French Foriegn Legion . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | I have experienced `` decisions '' by committee . 
Listen to the upside , downside , likes , dislikes blah blah blah . 
At the end of the meeting , I make the call . 
Let the French discuss it into the ground . 
I say drop a 2000 pounder on Kadafi and lets , the USA , call it game over . 
Then we can debate that for years . 
Poop or get off the pot ! 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | Barbara Teixeira - Las Vegas , NV A Committee ? 
And next they will argue about who should be the chairman ! 
Are there no leaders in this world ? 
How about one leader who knows what the heck he -LRB- or she -RRB- is doing ? 
Maybe we should let Hillary run the show . 
If this is what is going on concerning this mess in Libya , then how about the US pulls out of the `` committee '' . 
We do n't need to have our fingerprints on everything . 
And especially not this mess . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | Yes , I think that a NATO-led committee should run the war in Libya and hopefully the U.S. stays out of the affair altogether . 
Let the U.N. assume the control and the expense of this operation . 
We already have enough to deal with in terms of military occupations and do not need to assume full responsibility by occupying a third arab country . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | Why not ? 
We have hearings on all manner of things . 
This is a compelling issue which should be discussed . 
We know too little about the Middle East and Islam : and apparently US government if we are to beleive that sad poll of earlier in the week . 
March 23 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . 
Now , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . 
Would you ride in a car that drives itself ? 
Is she the answer ?

2011-03-23,"By John P. Avlon , CNN Contributor John Avlon : Voices are being raised against Obama 's action against Libya He says many are coming from the left , not the right Some liberals are very unhappy with Obama 's continuation of some Bush policies , he says Avlon : Obama is making policy based on reality , not ideology Editor 's note : John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for The Daily Beast . 
He is the author of `` Wingnuts : How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America . '' 
New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's dj vu all over again . 
Congressman Dennis Kucinich is talking impeachment . 
Ralph Nader is grumbling that the president of the United States is a `` war criminal . '' 
Michael Moore is venting his spleen on the subject of U.S. hypocrisy . 
What 's different is that the president provoking the professional protest crowd this time is a Democrat . 
For all the overheated anger at President Obama from the far right , where people have called him a socialist and worse , the fact is that Obama is n't considered a ideological soul mate by the far left . 
One of the reasons : Libya is just the latest example of Obama embracing national security executive powers that have prompted some liberals to claim that he is leading George W. Bush 's third term . 
First , there was the decision to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan . 
Then came the realization that closing Guantanamo was easier said than done . 
There is the administration 's use of wiretaps and escalation of predator drone strikes . 
And now the airstrikes in Libya , engaged without extensively consulting Congress . 
War power policy in question An objective assessment of the Obama record on foreign policy shows that he has not been the soft liberal ideologue that conservatives want to run against . 
An excellent book by my Daily Beast colleague Stephen Carter , `` The Violence of Peace , '' analyzes Obama 's War Doctrine at length from a legal , but readable , perspective . 
Carter writes , `` On matters of national security , at least , the Oval Office evidently changes the outlook of its occupant far more than the occupant changes the outlook of the Oval Office . '' 
While Obama has changed the unilateral style of the Bush administration , he 's kept much of the substance . 
He has drawn down troops in Iraq , as promised . 
But on many other fronts , he has found that campaign rhetoric often does not square with the responsibilities of governing . 
Because many on the left define themselves in opposition to authority , they are historically quick to turn on presidents of their own party for being insufficiently liberal -- whether it is Truman 's and Kennedy 's Cold Warrior enthusiasm , LBJ 's escalation of the Vietnam War , Jimmy Carter 's budget cuts or Bill Clinton 's welfare reform . 
Kucinich has been joined by a small chorus of voices from the left in Congress in condemning the president . 
These include : Barbara Lee -LRB- who was the lone vote against the Afghanistan invasion after 9\/11 -RRB- ; Michael Capuano -LRB- last seen telling a union rally `` you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody '' -RRB- ; Maxine Waters -LRB- who repeatedly pulled a proto-Joe Wilson by calling President Bush a `` liar '' -RRB- and Sheila Jackson Lee -LRB- a House Foreign Affairs committee member who last year said `` Today we have two Vietnams , side by side , North and South '' -RRB- . 
This cast of characters is a fair representation of the far left in the minds of the right . 
And yet they are now among Obama 's fiercest critics . 
That should be a reality check that resonates with centrist and independent voters . 
But you 've got to give Obama 's critics on the left points for ideological consistency . 
They are apparently not swayed by simple partisanship . 
Some of their newfound allies on the right , however , will have a harder time making that case . 
For example , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , a potential Republican presidential candidate , took aim at the Libya intervention , calling it `` opportunistic amateurism without planning or professionalism . '' 
A few days earlier , as Alana Goodman pointed out in Commentary , he had been criticizing Obama 's inaction , saying , `` This is a moment to get rid of -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- . 
Get it over with . '' 
Libertarian , and longtime critic of the neo-cons , Ron Paul can at least claim consistency in his circulation of a congressional resolution `` expressing the sense of Congress that the President is required to obtain in advance specific statutory authorization for the use of United States Armed Forces in response to civil unrest in Libya . '' 
Among its supporters to date is Detroit Democrat John Conyers -- Ron Paul 's philosophic opposite on almost everything . 
The Beltway buzz was that committed partisans finally found something upon which they could agree . 
Obama can be criticized for delay in his decision to impose a no-fly zone . 
He can be criticized for communicating more with allies in advance of multilateral action than with members of Congress . 
He can be criticized for lack of military experience before entering office and insufficiently clear directives after . 
But the secret hiding in plain sight is that Barack Obama was never the simple `` anti-war candidate '' his leftist supporters hoped or his conservative opponents feared . 
While he opposed Iraq from the beginning , he supported escalation in Afghanistan , even proposing drone strikes into Pakistan during the campaign . 
The criticism of the professional left and the professional right is likely to heat up if the conflict drags on . 
Michael Moore 's tweeted sarcasm will set the tone for other liberal Obama critics on the netroots : `` We 've had a `` no-fly zone '' over Afghanistan for over 9 years . 
How 's that going ? 
But Moore 's suggestion that Obama return his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ignores the substance of what the president said in his acceptance speech : `` I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds , as it was in the Balkans , or in other places that have been scarred by war . 
Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later . 
That is why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace . '' 
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John P. Avlon .

2011-03-23,"Libyan civil war : An opening for al Qaeda and jihad ? 
March 23 , 2011 | By Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister , CNN Libyan youths walk past a burnt out building in this file picture in the eastern Libyan town of Derna on February 23 , 2011 . 
The town of Derna is not much to look at -- a heap of Soviet-style concrete buildings in a deprived and windswept corner of eastern Libya . 
But it has a rich history -- fought over and colonized since Roman times -- and a stunning location on the Mediterranean . 
It has also gained a reputation as a hotbed of jihadists . 
And that has diplomats and analysts asking whether the unrest in Libya might provide an opening for al Qaeda and fellow travelers , just a short hop from Europe . 
Derna even made it into U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by Wikileaks . 
A cable from 2008 describes it as a `` wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters '' for al Qaeda in Iraq . 
High youth unemployment , discrimination by the Gadhafi regime and the influence of veteran Libyan jihadists from Afghanistan all played a role in radicalizing a new generation . 
`` Other factors include a dearth of social outlets for young people , -LRB- and -RRB- local pride in Derna 's history as a locus of fierce opposition to occupation , '' the cable said . 
`` Most young men watched a mix of al-Jazeera news , religious sermons and western action films on English language satellite channels broadcast from the Gulf . 
The result was a heady mixture of violence , religious conservatism and hatred of U.S. policy in Iraq and Palestine . '' 
Today , Derna is very much in the opposition 's hands , and accounts from eastern Libya say Islamists and others are fighting side-by-side with one aim : removing Moammar Gadhafi . 
But what comes next ? 
Gadhafi has been quick to raise the specter of al Qaeda as the beneficiary of unrest in Libya , even claiming that it was drugging young Libyans into opposing his rule . 
The regime has also paraded a former member of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group who had allegedly been `` captured '' during fighting in Zawiyah . 
While the regime 's claims may seem outlandish , a former leader of Libyan jihadists tells CNN that al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya . 
`` If there is a power vacuum in Libya there will be an open market for al Qaeda , '' says Noman Benotman , a former commander in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and one-time ally of Osama bin Laden . 
The LIFG fought the Gadhafi regime in the 1990s , but formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime two years ago , and repudiated al Qaeda . 
Benotman is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation in London , a counter-terrorism think tank . 
"
2011-03-23,"By the CNN Wire Staff Gadhafi : ` We will be victorious ' Obama says U.S. will be able to hand over control of mission in days Gadhafi says he will emerge victorious Four children killed in Misrata fighting , doctor says A U.S. fighter jet crashed after a malfunction Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi crowed , `` I do not scare , '' the United States Tuesday got back two crew members whose F-15E fighter jet malfunctioned and said it will be able to hand over command of the coalition that has hammered loyalist military positions over four days . 
Meanwhile , fighting raged in Misrata , east of the capital , where a witness claimed Gadhafi has placed snipers on the tops of buildings . 
Also Tuesday , the commander of U.S. Naval forces in Europe and Africa said multinational air strikes would continue until Gadhafi complies with a United Nations mandate to stop attacking civilians . 
Americans `` are going to be satisfied that lives were saved '' by the U.S. military action , President Barack Obama said during a visit to El Salvador . 
He said the timetable for a transition of military leadership will be coming in days , rather than weeks . 
Gadhafi vowed Tuesday to emerge victorious in his battle with international forces seeking to impose a no-fly zone in his country and to halt his forces from attacking civilians . 
Santorum : Mission confusion in Libya Obama hopes Libyan rebels will organize Inside bombed Libyan military base Gadhafi sitting on billions in gold `` We will not give up , '' he said to a crowd of supporters , many of them waving green flags in a speech broadcast on state television . 
`` They will not terrorize us . 
We are making fun of their rockets . 
The Libyans are laughing at these rockets . 
We will defeat them by any method . '' 
He said Libyans `` are leading the international war against imperialism , against despots and I tell you , I do not scare . '' 
Gadhafi is violating the U.N. Security Council resolution by `` continued aggressive actions his forces have taken against the civilian population , '' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Locklear III said . 
Locklear also spoke about the U.S. F-15E Strike Eagle that had flown from Aviano air base in Italy to Libya , where the fighter experienced mechanical problems . 
Both the pilot and the weapons officer ejected and were rescued within hours -- one retrieved by the U.S. military , the other by anti-Gadhafi Libyans . 
The aviators , who suffered minor injuries when they landed , were both out of Libya and in U.S. hands , Locklear said . 
The U.S. military dispatched a pair of Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft from the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge , about 100 miles off the coast of Libya , to rescue the downed aviators , said Capt. Richard Ulsh , spokesman for the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit . 
But the two men landed in different places when they parachuted , and the U.S. rescue crew was able to pick up only the pilot . 
He was flown to the Kearsarge , which has extensive medical facilities . 
Libyan rebels recovered the second crew member and treated him with `` respect and dignity '' until coalition forces were able to reach him , Locklear said . 
Residents in the area , some of whom witnessed the crash , told CNN they combed farmlands to search for the two Americans . 
They also expressed their gratitude to coalition members for the United Nations-authorized coalition attack on Libyan air defense targets meant to protect civilians . 
Locklear said he would investigate reports villagers were injured when allied forces opened fire during rescue operations . 
`` The recovery mission from my perspective was executed as I would have expected it to be given the circumstances , '' he said . 
Criticism and questions persist about the Libyan campaign , with no clear answer on who will take over command of the military operation and what the endgame or exit strategy will be . 
But U.S. officials said the international mission has succeeded in halting Gadhafi 's momentum . 
Rebels help rescue U.S. serviceman Locklear told reporters that initial military strikes by the French , followed by attacks by Britain and the United States , have rendered Gadhafi 's long-range air defenses and his air force largely ineffective . 
And the Libyan opposition 's newly formed administration urged the international community to continue enforcing the U.N. charter . 
`` The interim national council has called on the international community to take all forceful deterrent measures , based on the U.N. charter and international covenants , to help the Libyan people put an end to further crimes against the humanity , '' the statement from the Transitional National Council said . 
Missiles rained down Tuesday and anti-aircraft fire pierced the night sky in Tripoli hours before dawn . 
The Libyan government took international journalists to a port area that appeared to have been damaged by missile strikes that left craters 15 feet deep . 
A destroyed mobile rocket launcher system lay smoldering . 
Several warehouses were hit . 
The United States fired 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Libya during a 12-hour period , said military spokeswoman Cmdr. Monica Rousselow . 
A total of 162 Tomahawks have been fired by the United States and Britain since the start Saturday of Operation Odyssey Dawn , which includes enforcement of a no-fly zone . 
The operation has included 212 U.S. and 124 sorties . 
The international operation has targeted air defense sites and command centers , but Gadhafi himself has not been targeted , and there are no plans to kill the leader , said Gen. Carter Ham , the head of U.S. forces in Africa . 
`` I could see accomplishing the military mission , which has been assigned to me , and the current leader would remain the current leader , '' he said . 
`` We think we have been very effective in degrading his ability to control his regime forces . '' 
Ham said no Libyan aircraft have been observed flying since the military operations began Saturday . 
And air attacks have stopped Libyan ground forces from approaching the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
But fighting raged in Misrata , a city under siege two hours east of Tripoli . 
Four children in the same family were among 13 civilians killed in Misrata fighting Tuesday , said Dr. Khaled Mansouri of Misrata Central Hospital . 
About 30 people were injured , he told CNN . 
The death toll from the clashes between Gadhafi forces and rebels in the city stands at 90 over the last five days . 
An opposition spokesman who would give only his first name , Mohamed , told CNN the situation in the city is dire and worsening by the hour as Gadhafi forces have taken control of the main street that leads from the city center to a highway that connects Misrata to Tripoli . 
Loyalist snipers are on the top of buildings , he said . 
The hospital is running out of medical supplies and are turning patients away , he said . 
`` I have seen a man whose broken arm is hanging being discharged because of lack of space , '' said Mohamed , who said he would not divulge his full name because of concern for his safety . 
He said the city has been without water and electricity for nine days . 
Violence has raged in Libya following protests calling for democracy and demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year rule . 
Protesters have been met by force from the Gadhafi regime , and numerous world leaders -- including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- have denounced the killings of civilians by Gadhafi 's troops . 
The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution Thursday that allows member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country ... while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . '' 
It also imposed a no-fly zone . 
Barak Barfi , a research fellow with the New America Foundation , said `` it 's certainly clear '' that the allied coalition has stymied the onslaught of Gadhafi troops against rebels in eastern Libya . 
`` Before the decision in the U.N. was taken Thursday , it seemed like Gadhafi was going to overrun the opposition in a matter of days , '' he said . 
But `` it 's unclear if the rebels can form under any type of organized command and move forward now that the airstrikes have taken away Gadhafi 's offensive capabilities , '' Barfi said Tuesday . 
`` It 's unclear at this point in time who would take control after Gadhafi leaves . 
We know that there are really no state institutions in Libya . '' 
A former Gadhafi aide told CNN Tuesday that the Libyan strongman would not go down easily . 
Abubaker Saad said Gadhafi has several bunkers deep underground and is likely hiding in one of them . 
`` As you probably all have noticed that now he is giving all of his statements by phone to the Libyan television , '' Saad said . 
Obama said that once leadership of the military mission in Libya shifts from the United States to the coalition , `` it is not going to be our planes maintaining the no-fly zone '' and `` it is not going to be our ships that are necessarily enforcing the arms embargo . '' 
There has been intense debate among the allies over NATO 's role going forward . 
The natural choice to coordinate `` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' would seem to be NATO with its experience leading and coordinating international coalitions , but U.S. and European officials tell CNN that some allies , especially French President Nicolas Sarkozy , are concerned the action in Libya could be perceived negatively as another NATO operation in another Arab country . 
Another complication is how to consolidate Arab support . 
The United States expects additional Arab support for the coalition enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya , a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday . 
So far , Qatar is the only Arab country that has contributed planes to mission . 
The official said that several Arab states are in the process of finalizing their plans , adding the Obama administration was `` confident we will have further concrete contributions of different kinds '' for enforcement of the resolution in the next two to three days .

2011-03-23,"By Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister , CNN Libyan youths walk past a burnt out building in this file picture in the eastern Libyan town of Derna on February 23 , 2011 . 
A former Libyan jihadist says al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya Diplomats and analysts ask whether unrest might provide an opening for al Qaeda There is a long history of Islamist radicalization in Libya Especially in the impoverished , restive eastern provinces -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The town of Derna is not much to look at -- a heap of Soviet-style concrete buildings in a deprived and windswept corner of eastern Libya . 
But it has a rich history -- fought over and colonized since Roman times -- and a stunning location on the Mediterranean . 
It has also gained a reputation as a hotbed of jihadists . 
And that has diplomats and analysts asking whether the unrest in Libya might provide an opening for al Qaeda and fellow travelers , just a short hop from Europe . 
Derna even made it into U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by Wikileaks . 
A cable from 2008 describes it as a `` wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters '' for al Qaeda in Iraq . 
High youth unemployment , discrimination by the Gadhafi regime and the influence of veteran Libyan jihadists from Afghanistan all played a role in radicalizing a new generation . 
`` Other factors include a dearth of social outlets for young people , -LRB- and -RRB- local pride in Derna 's history as a locus of fierce opposition to occupation , '' the cable said . 
`` Most young men watched a mix of al-Jazeera news , religious sermons and western action films on English language satellite channels broadcast from the Gulf . 
The result was a heady mixture of violence , religious conservatism and hatred of U.S. policy in Iraq and Palestine . '' 
President Obama 's plan on Libya Obama on Libya : We have saved lives Gadhafi : ` We will be victorious ' Today , Derna is very much in the opposition 's hands , and accounts from eastern Libya say Islamists and others are fighting side-by-side with one aim : removing Moammar Gadhafi . 
But what comes next ? 
Gadhafi has been quick to raise the specter of al Qaeda as the beneficiary of unrest in Libya , even claiming that it was drugging young Libyans into opposing his rule . 
The regime has also paraded a former member of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group who had allegedly been `` captured '' during fighting in Zawiyah . 
While the regime 's claims may seem outlandish , a former leader of Libyan jihadists tells CNN that al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya . 
`` If there is a power vacuum in Libya there will be an open market for al Qaeda , '' says Noman Benotman , a former commander in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and one-time ally of Osama bin Laden . 
The LIFG fought the Gadhafi regime in the 1990s , but formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime two years ago , and repudiated al Qaeda . 
Benotman is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation in London , a counter-terrorism think tank . 
Having played no role in the rebellion so far , al Qaeda and its affiliates will have to play catch-up if they do want to exploit the situation , says Benotman . 
Individuals who might have jihadist sympathies are keeping them under wraps for the sake of uniting with one aim : removing Gadhafi , he says . 
Added to which there has been a broad welcome among Libyan rebels of all stripes for U.S. and coalition airstrikes to protect the city of Benghazi . 
According to Benotman , dozens of former LIFG fighters have now joined rebel efforts to topple Gadhafi , but he stressed that they had done so in a personal capacity rather than organizing operations as a group . 
Protest movements across the Middle East -- predominantly secular and pro-democracy -- have so far reduced the jihadist message to irrelevance . 
But Benotman sees potentially dangerous parallels in Libya with neighboring Algeria and with Afghanistan . 
After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 , the West walked away from Afghanistan rather than use its `` soft power '' to bring about positive change , he says . 
The Taliban eventually filled the void . 
As a young jihadist , Benotman was there to witness it . 
Fighter jet crash : What happened Preparing for battle in Libya And in Algeria , a 1992 army coup following electoral gains by radical Islamist parties spawned a violent insurgency . 
More than 100,000 Algerians were killed in a savage conflict between the state and Islamist extremists before the insurgency waned in the mid-1990s . 
Some Western counter-terrorism officials fret that a prolonged civil war in Libya could open up space for al Qaeda . 
Governments and NGOs have to be quick , says Benotman , in helping rebel-held areas develop education , health-care and the institutions of democracy . 
Libya -- like Yemen -- has a less developed `` civil society '' than either Egypt or Tunisia after 40 years of authoritarian rule . 
It also has entrenched tribal rivalries and a small middle class . 
Such conditions were compounded by Gadhafi 's strategy of divide and rule through a baffling array of competing power centers . 
Al Qaeda has already scented an opportunity . 
Its leading ideologue , Abu Yahya al-Libi -- himself a Libyan -- told Islamists in the country : `` Store your weapons and do not relinquish them . '' 
In an audio tape released on March 12 , he said that `` ousting these regimes is not the end in making a change . '' 
A week later the leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- had a similar message . 
In an audiotape posted on Jihadist websites and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group , Abu Musab Wadud told Gadhafi 's opponents : `` We will be side-by-side with you , Allah willing . '' 
Until now , That may be wishful thinking . 
AQIM has in recent times been restricted to remote parts of Mali , Niger and Mauritania and has suffered leadership splits . 
Wadud may also have damaged his cause by predicting the United States and NATO would never help the rebels because they were the `` source of the disaster . '' 
But al Qaeda is nothing if not persistent . 
And there is a long history of Islamist radicalization in Libya , especially in the impoverished , restive eastern provinces . 
At the peak of the Iraqi insurgency , more jihadists per capita traveled to join al Qaeda in Iraq from Libya than from any other country . 
And according to al Qaeda records seized by the U.S. Army in Iraq , in 2006-07 more volunteers -- a total of 53 -- traveled to Iraq from Derna than any other city in the Arab world . 
And in the 1990s , Benotman 's group had tried to establish a safe haven in Derna , eventually being bombed into submission by the Libyan air force . 
Which brings us back to the U.S. cable from 2008 , in which an American diplomat who traveled to Derna , quoted a local businessman who had `` likened young men in Derna to Bruce Willis ' character in the action picture ` Die Hard , ' who stubbornly refused to die quietly . 
For them , resistance against coalition forces in Iraq is an important act of ` jihad ' and a last act of defiance against the Gadhafi regime . '' 
`` It 's jihad -- it 's our duty , and you 're talking about people who do n't have much else to be proud of , '' he said . 
Maybe that at last is changing . 
"
2011-03-23,"Once again , Western bombs are falling on the sand-blown weapons testing range that is north Africa , the Middle East and the landscape of the old Great Game . 
The area stretching roughly from Morocco to Afghanistan west to east , and Syria to the Persian Gulf north to south -- let s call this region Deathistan -- long has been contested . 
But in the last century , the region has been treated as a plaything by Western capitals . 
The United States and United Kingdom , which boast of enlightenment , cause harm when they please in the Deathistan region . 
Less than a generation ago it amused the United States to encourage Saddam Hussein to slaughter Iranians ; then conditions changed , so the United States started killing in Iraq . 
Right now the United States and NATO are taking lives in Libya and Afghanistan . 
In these places , U.S. and other Western armed forces in the main behave with high ethics . 
But their missions are to slay and destroy , and here s the bottom line : Western meddling in north Africa , the Arab world and the Great Game territories has not worked . 
Israel exists : that is the West s principal achievement in the region , though for a comparatively small number of people . 
Otherwise , the last century of attempts by the United States and European powers to manipulate the Deathistan region rarely has come to good . 
We ve sure blown a lot of stuff up . 
When innocents were killed inside the United States on 9-11 , America claimed , with justification , a right of outrage . 
When innocents are killed by Western action elsewhere -- hundreds of thousands have died in Iraq and Afghanistan in the U.S. retaliation for the 3,000 dead of 2001 -- the West washes its hands , or issues a press release . 
Muammar Gaddafi is an awful dictator . 
But no one in the Washington or London establishments seemed to care about that even a short time ago . 
Libyan oil money was moving freely ; in 2009 , Gaddafi was presented to the world by the New York Times as an op-ed columnist , as a leader and sage . 
Now the West is bombing Libya , without debate in Congress or European parliaments -- and over the objections of Turkey , which understands much of the region better than does the West . 
Though aimed at Gaddafi s arms , some of the bombs are killing civilians : others , killing military conscripts who have little choice about their fates . 
Maybe the bombing will stop Gaddafi from repressing his country . 
Maybe it will just smash some stuff and usher in a different type of repression -- this being the Western pattern of interactions with the region . 
Despite extensive Western involvement in Deathistan , most nations there remain backward and authoritarian . 
Maybe that s in part because of Western meddling , including periodic fits of use of force . 
Much of the modern form of the region was created by Western fiat . 
Borders of Iraq , Iran and many Gulf states were drawn in London ; British troops occupied Iran during World War II ; the United States deposed a democratically elected government in Iran in 1953 , then tried to control Iran in the 1970s ; then armed Iraq against Iran in the 1980s ; now regularly shakes its fist at Tehran ; Britain and France attacked Egypt in 1956 ; the United States armed Islamic rebels in Afghanistan in the 1980s and now fights Islamic rebels there . 
I don t mean this paragraph as a history of the region , merely a brief reminder of the extent of Western involvement . 
The fact that Europe and the United States shaped the Deathistan region does not give them a right to do as they please there . 
Of course the West should advocate change . 
But there s a vast difference between siding with democracy and sending in attack jets . 
Choose any nation roughly the geographic size of Iraq -LRB- say , Spain -RRB- or roughly the population of Libya -LRB- say , Sicily -RRB- . 
If the United States had staged all-out attacks on Spain twice in the last 20 years , or bombed Sicily twice in the last 25 years , how advanced or happy might these nations be ? 
That s what the United States has done to Iraq and Libya . 
Suppose really something bad were happening in America . 
Suppose George W. Bush refused to leave office : was barricaded in the White House , and attempting to cancel civil liberties . 
Now suppose Libya or Iraq possessed supercarrier strike groups , and responded to the bad news from the United States by launching missiles at military bases near Washington and dropping bombs along the East Coast . 
Not only would America be furious -- this wouldn t work ! 
Things would not get better in America ; they d get worse . 
Yet the West expects such tactics to work in north Africa , the Middle East and the old Great Game areas . 
I will skip the complication that use of force may be morally wrong : is there one single soul in Washington who still cares about morality in use of force ? 
It is enough that the bottom line is that U.S. meddling usually fails . 
If the United States and European Union stopped trying to manipulate the Deathistan region , and stopped dropping bombs there , the nations of this area might stay backward and repressive . 
Or , might improve . 
We ll never find out until such time as the West simply leaves these nations alone , and lets them reform themselves .

REUTERS\/Suhaib Salem ; A protester sits in a makeshift shelter on a street during an anti-Gaddafi demonstration in Benghazi March 22 , 2011 . 
Obama has proved to be an imperialist not unlike W. What a dirty farce ! 
Like your term in quotes . 
The sudden shift from dragging one 's feet to support a no-fly zone , to taking leaderhsip in all out bombing was quite unexpected and drastic . 
It almost seems like they wanted to use the Arab League 's support as an excuse ; and once they got it , their action betrayed a certain insincerity . 
I hope the fighting end soon , with limited casualty for everyone . 
I have reservations about whether some of the Middle Eastern conflicts are going to result in democracies . 
Egypt is hopeful , but not many of the others , Libya included . 
If the civil war becomes protracted , even if there will be fair democratic elections , those who had voted for losig candidates often resort to violence . 
Look at Ivory Coast . 
Not to be a pessimist , but such situations seem rather common in Africa . 
Perhaps the biggest disappointment in the region is the gross incompetence of Western governments , especially the USA . 
There are plenty of neutral American citizens who have first hand knowledge of and on the ground experience in the region . 
I exclude all recipients of Federal funding however indirect . 
Consultation with these experienced people would have avoided the worst mistakes at least . 
But we will not . 
We have expert commentators on Government radio -LRB- NPR -RRB- who do not seem to know that Turks are not arabs , yet have ever so delicate evaluations of the accuracy of Turkish opinion . 
This is not only absurd , it is embarrassing . 
Since we will not even attempt to act in the interest of the American people as a whole , we need to put a flat Cuban style embargo on the whole region until we grow up . 
The bureaucrats hands must be tied and tightly . 
So what 's the point of the UN Security Council ? 
Why are we a part of it ? 
We should have used our resources to take out Iran 's nuclear program and perhaps their leaders if we should bomb anyone . 
We are n't doing them or us any favors . 
Whether it 's capitalists or democratic government it really all comes down to having access to cheap oil . 
If they did n't have oil the US would n't be there . 
Now no one can deny that the foreign Policy of the United States has always been a twisted loop of hypocrisy in the Middle East and even globally . 
But to generalize the current situation in Libya and make comparisons to the invasions of Iraq , Afghanistan in the last decade as well as previous foreign policy disasters of previous decades is inflammatory at best . 
As the worlds only nation that can project considerable power anywhere in the world within 48 hours , it is our responsibility to lead and act to prevent humanitarian disasters in conjunction with local , regional and international consultation . 
There is no indication or confirmation of any civilians killed by coalition aircraft in Libya to date . 
There is a clear UN mandate that specifies no ground troops and a clear indication that the opposition forces in Libya wanted , in fact begged for western protection against overwhelming and indiscriminate attacks by Gaddafi forces against cities and civilian targets . 
This is not Iraq in 2003 , and its not Afghanistan . 
With great power comes great responsibility , like it or not we have a role to play in the Middle East and without pressure from the United States none of the current revolutions in the Middle East would have succeeded without considerable bloodshed if at all . 
It is the only reason the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia step down as quietly as they did . 
What is happening right now in the Middle East is not because of the United States , but of the people . 
This is the best chance in 50 years to make a meaningful change in one of the most volatile and radical regions of the world . 
We must stand ready to assist , not interfere but assist when absolutely necessary the pro-democracy movements lest they be brutally crushed by these regimes , and we are stuck continuing with brutal regimes that oppress their populations and drive people towards extremism and violence . 
I understand your opinion , but given the completely different circumstances of the situation in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan and international and regional support for action we must take a lead as is our responsibility . 
Because if we do n't do it , no one will . 
We can not fear to act in the future , because of mistakes in the past . 
You left out the cold war . 
You leave out the military actions in other parts of the world fueled by the cold war . 
The three super powers The USSR , the USA and China all wanted a long reach and they have played the balance of powers game that was the rule of European politics since the Middle Ages . 
In fact it has been the rule for all empires for as long as they have existed . 
The balance of powers is expected and not to participate is to declare weakness to the other powers . 
The big powers frighten each other into action . 
And all the empires that have ever existed have died long and lingering deaths to be replaced by new powers . 
The new powers cannibalize the old . 
I am old enough to remember history classes that praised the virility of countries that could support aggressive military action and not merely defensive capability . 
For some reason the USA keeps declaring itself the sole super power and doesn t seem to realize that rhetoric might be out of date . 
I m sure the British and French still think they are or might yet reclaim some of their old martial and territorial glory or at least can play on the memory of it . 
The superpower has to push against something as large and strong or it will fall over . 
In a way it is making the rival empire it needs out of Deathistan as you call the countries of the Magreb and Levant . 
You don t mention the rhetoric of the Middle East just listen to the way the Israeli s and Palestinians talk about each other in fits of rage . 
They still believe in the glory of war and the Israeli s still believe in the right of holding territory by conquest . 
The Iranians still like that Death to America mantra . 
The Middle East has a fondness for Iron handed leadership . 
Perhaps what should really scare the US is that it is tending to have to make the greatest efforts and spend the largest fortunes for dubious returns in order to achieve goals the rest of the world seems to want -LRB- the rights outlined in the UN Universal Bill of Human Rights ? -RRB- 
while the rest of the so called former super powers and the rest of the smaller countries tend to want a less active role and watch from a distance and wait while it slowly falls apart economically and politically . 
They can play the economic lambs to our ravenous beast . 
And then declare how stupid we were for being so arrogant . 
So many people admire and envy a superstar but they also love to watch it become over-extended and fall apart . 
The supermarket tabloids love the collapse of the rich and famous . 
Diplomats and heads of state read classier and more complex tales of the rise and fall of the formerly great . 
Another thing you don t mention , and where this comment may be so na ve , is that the collapse of the middle class in this country is making conditions that could be ripe for a tyranny to take over this country -LRB- some would say we are already there -RRB- that feeds on war as an outlet for the frustration of it s own population . 
Then the US could be a world-dominating scourge of humanity . 
But if that is the case this paragraph should go at the top and the rest would still follow , just perhaps not in my lifetime or in the lifetime of those still in grammar school . 
But they would have to be teaching a rabid patriotism for that to work and as far as I know they aren t . 
What a great overview of what happens when the west interferes . 
I do hope more people take note of the fact , interference in other nations affairs which seems to happen regularly by the west simply does not produve the expected result . 
As long as you are pro - west any country can do what it likes , murder half its citizens and the west will ignore it or put out a mild press staement . 
If the murder is done by a leader opposed to the west then the response is not as mild but close to hysterical condemnation and interferece in one form or another . 
At thee same time the west only interferes openly in countries who can not fight back , which certainly shows how courageous the western politicians are . 
Apples to oranges , Mr. Easterbrook . 
This `` article '' is overflowing with idiotic comparisons that would n't hold water in a 5th grade book report , let alone succeed in coming close to substantiating your argument . 
I can t imagine how it can ever be perceived by logically thinking humans capable of counting to ten , as anything but a hollow-minded rant . 
How did you get this published , anyway ? 
Your `` opinion '' is shallow , ill-conceived and presented poorly at its best . 
I have yet to hear from a single source that innocent Libyan `` civilians '' have officially been killed by Western forces , either by air or land strike . 
I agree that it is highly questionable that we empower Gaddhafi at first then daemonize him when he complicates our energy resources ... but that 's the nature of world politics . 
And for the sake of human rights and treaty efforts , I do n't think it would have been smart to denounce Gaddhafi as leader in the West -- look what that did to Cambodia -- it gives the impression that all potential interventions are out -LRB- nobody cares -RRB- . 
I also do n't think allies `` encourage '' allies , in the Hussein Iran example you `` responsibly '' made , in times of war to kill as simply as you implied . 
Do n't forget that there were innocent civilians under Hussein 's regime who were being attacked . 
Libya would have been another Rwanda , Darfur , and we 'd be left shaking our heads again -- no matter what , you 're not going to `` win '' participating or watching violence . 
You 're choice : are you a selfish perv , or a murdering idealist ? 
You need a reality check . 
Spain is not Libya . 
Sicily is not Iraq . 
Their leaders are not raping the citizens of all their wealth . 
Oil money from Iraq and Libya went straight to the dictator 's pockets . 
You are living in a democracy and have the freedom to write tripe like this . 
Nontheless , your opinions are not widely held , thank God . 
What a load of rubbish . 
But for the oil and natural gas under their feet , the entire world would care about this `` vital region '' as much as they do about the Seychelle Islands . 
But their fossil fuel resources bring them wealth and influence disproportionate to their actual economic contributions to the world economy and its culture . 
The spoils of this wealth have allowed murderous thugs to maintain themselves in a style an Ottoman sultan would have blushed at . 
I forget , how many palaces did Saddam Hussein have ? 
They must all have been justified by the legacy of colonialism -LRB- Up yours Imperialists ! -RRB- . 
One looks on in admiration at what went on in Egypt and is going on elsewhere in the region where people realize they do n't have to live this way . 
But maybe this author could also mention the proliferation of Soviet produced arms in the region . 
Surely there was no titanic geopolitical struggle that went on for 40 plus years that could explain the constant shifting of national interests that occurred . 
Nope , must all be a conspiracy by the whole world -LRB- led by the perfidious West -RRB- to have cheap oil -LRB- the majority of which is controlled by an altruistic and benign cartel that meets in Vienna -RRB- under the control of pliable despots . 
One knows Arabs are never personally responsible for anything , ever , right ? 
Least of all the resignation that it is written they be pawns in the game of life . 
From Pogo : `` We have met the enemy and he is us . '' 
Well said Mr. Easterbrook . 
Of course the solutions are extremely complicated . 
But , these simple truths must guide all solutions . 
The simple comparison to our US homeland is a perfect example . 
This is a beautifully written and elegantly argued column . 
A couple of years ago I would have agreed with it . 
But Deathistan has changed . 
What we are seeing today in the Middle East are revolutions started not by Al Qeuda , not by the CIA , but by the people themselves . 
These uprisings are not imposed on them , and they are not inspired by ideologues of either the Muslim or Western variety . 
The people are fighting for democracy . 
They have been ruled by ruthless despots for generations and have no arms to fight with , which makes their struggle all the more courageous . 
Should the West just sit back in its armchair and watch the bloody and unbalanced spectacle on TV ? 
Is that the right thing to do ? 
Or should we help them fight for a just cause which , in the case of Libya , would surely be doomed without our help ? 
I agree that the West has a bad and deserved reputation for meddling in the affairs of the Middle East -LRB- and elsewhere . -RRB- 
But there 's an important difference between meddling solely for one 's own political or economic gain and helping in a struggle whose cause we believe in , and that would surely perish without our intervention . 
The Middle East is younger , restless , wary of the old order , and ready for change . 
They are realizing that clinging to an ideology is not the answer , that they need to stumble forward on the path of democracy and find their own way . 
In some ways , we can learn from their example . 
Does it make sense , and is it always for the good , to cling to an ideology of non-intervention , regardless of the circumstances ? 
What are the consequences ? 
We all need to be aware of our ideologies . 
It 's easy to judge Islamists and Teabaggers when they appear rigid to those who do n't share their beliefs . 
But if you believe rigidity is a problem , take a look at the man in the mirror , and face your own non-interventionist beliefs . 
You need n't go into such a scholarly print to decipher what 's in the minds of these politicians . 
It 's all about oil and the dollar sign . 
Whenever there 's turmoil that threatens the flow and price of this precious liquid , the big guys are in . 
Not to save the locals , but their wallets . 
The U.S. was swift in rescuing Kuwait from Saddam not because they like the handsome looks of the Kuwaitis . 
Did they blink an eye when locals were butchered by Indonesian forces in East Timor ? 
Easterbrook has some valid points . 
Where this and other regional conflicts have changed recently is in the communications . 
It would have taken hard people to ignore the often live pleas for help heard on the news channels . 
And of course there is the oil . 
There are plenty of dictators in Africa who make Gadaffi seem almost saintly . 
What puzzle me is why UN step on their toes as soon as something does not goes the way the Western Powers would like it to be . 
The world will be better off without Gadhafi s type of government , but the reality is , nothing is perfect in this world including the so call democracy . 
Where these International Zorro s were when Pinochet was protected by Thatcher s government against crime of humanity ? 
What about Fujimori from Chile killing his people by thousands ? 
You may say they were fighting again the bad guys ; the communists . 
So , they deserve the support of Zorro to save the world . 
Same question can be asked about Pol Pot in Cambodia and Marcos in the Philippe and all others . 
Until UN will be free of manipulation by Western Powers all those Zorro s will continue to shape the world to their own goods which have nothing to do with democracy . 
Unfortunately is a word to often use to justify the unjustifiable . 
Now gregg , imagine this scenario . 
A high ranking official of your state is slaughtering the people in your area . 
This person has gone mad and is doing as he pleases with no reprocussions . 
The people have started a revolt . 
The have started to stand up to him . 
To regain the basic humanitarian rights they deserve . 
And he being more technologically advanced goes day by day toying with their lives . 
Would you then not want help ? 
These people are asking for help . 
Why should we sit back and not protect those who need it when we have the ability to help ? 
If we would give up a little luxury here and there we would not be in this financial whole we are in now and we would be able to do more for these people who have no way to defend themselves . 
Your local police department did n't always exist . 
It was put there to protect you when you needed it . 
I know the US or the western countries as you name it are not the official police for this planet . 
So the UN and the US has stepped up to try to protect those who need it . 
Maybe one day we can get a World Police Order put in place that would allow the world as a whole to decide what a country can do . 
We rely to heavily on one another to let tyrants destroy the people they are put into place to protect . 
Is this battle about oil ? 
I dont know , none of us common folk do . 
Will we ever know ? 
But whether we went in for oil or for the people , as long as we are able to save a few lives of those who are fighting every day to survive and being oppressed then for whatever reason we are there , the outcome will be better for those people . 
They will have a chance . 
What comes of that chance is for them to decide . 
Interesting point of view , but from a greedy point of view would n't it have been in America 's interest to allow Gaddafi to wipe out much of his opposition in Libya ? 
It 's been years since Gaddafi has threatened the West and he was unlikely to do so during the rest of his life . 
Libya was becoming a popular tourist destination . 
The current unrest is a factor in driving the price of oil higher at a time when America 's economy can ill afford increased energy costs . 
It seems to me that America is trying to shape a Libyan government that is a grateful friend at a time when not taking action might cost more lives than taking action . 
It also appears based on the current situation that Middle East autocracies would probably do very little good for their citizens if left to their own devices . 
The current revolutions in the area seem to be a genuine attempt by the people to improve their own lot in an otherwise hopeless situation . 
Nonetheless , your arguments have some merit . 
Posted by breezinthru | Report as abusive Thank you for finally stating what has so often been relegated to `` dissident '' or `` minority '' publications on a mainstream news outlet . 
Major figures on the American Left and Right would concur with you : from Noam Chomsky and Bernie Sanders to Ron Paul and Grover Norquist . 
The imperialist war state will impoverish the basis of its own power -- as it did the empires of Alexander , Rome , Khan , the Soviet Union and eventually the United States . 
In our case , it is waged in the name of defense , but any idiot knows that 's just a byline for oil : Iraq 2 being the primary and most obvious example , though this is also the case for Afghanistan -LRB- Osama , the boogieman , is STILL not wanted as a suspect for 911 , yet Unocal 's pipeline project has proceeded quite smoothly -RRB- . 
You mention only the Middle East , but we also must realize that trade interests have motivated illegal and undemocratic regime change coups in Latin America for more than 60 years . 
The economic benefits of our not-so-covert oil and free trade zone war Imperialism are only distributed to a few in our society , precisely because it is not `` we '' who desire or direct these efforts : it is the prerogative of the few industrial and commercial forces that stand to gain from them in the short term . 
I find the assurances that the Middle East can never find peace , and that Western nations are wasting our time , money , and everyone 's lives to be both sad and ironic . 
The reasonic seems clear , blood feuds going back centuries , widespread inequality and violations of human rights . 
Wars such as that between Iran and Iraq , and the Soviet war in Afghanistan cost about a million lives each . 
What hope can there be for the future ? 
Better to just look the other way while they butcher , burn , poison , and stone each other like they have been for millenia right ? 
Ironically a bit over half a centry ago it would have been just as clear that Europe was spiraling into a pattern of perpetual bloodshed of ever more massive proportions . 
The rule of thumb was once a pan-European war once per generation . 
Yet today Europe is at peace . 
How bout tit-for-tat blood feuds ? 
Consider the history of revaunchism that led to WWII . 
That goes back to the conquest of Prussia by the French under Napoleon in 1806 , almost a century and a half before . 
`` Civilized '' people have long memories too ! 
Prussia was forced to pay santions afterward , and those sanctions formed the basis for the sanctions placed on the French after Germany defeated France in 1871 . 
These sanctions in turn formed the basis of those placed on Germany in the treaty of Versailles after WWI , which helped set the stage for WWII . 
And while the death toll seen in Middle Eastern wars and terrorism may seem shocking to us today , just one battle in WWI killed as many people as either of the two most brutal wars in the Middle East . 
While those wars cost a million lives a piece , the first world war cost 16 million European lives , and set the stage for world war two which cost 40 million European lives , with the firebombing of cities killing tens of thousands of civilians in a single day . 
What Middle-Eastern blood feud has spilled such blood ? 
The peace in Europe today is testimony to the ability of humanity to put behind us the collective harms and insults of generations past no matter how grievous they might have been . 
If Europe can live in peace today , peace is possible for any people , anywhere . 
Interesting point of view , but from a greedy point of view would n't it have been in America 's interest to allow Gaddafi to wipe out much of his opposition in Libya ? 
It 's been years since Gaddafi has threatened the West and he was unlikely to do so during the rest of his life . 
Libya was becoming a popular tourist destination . 
The current unrest is a factor in driving the price of oil higher at a time when America 's economy can ill afford increased energy costs .

Posted by breezinthru | Report as abusive What we are seeing are the seeds of World War 3 sprouting . 
Deathistan is where empires go to die ... . . 
and we have seen this happen over and over again throughout history . 
It 's amazing how if you got back even further you will observe that even back to the Greeks , Romans , Barbarians , Ottomans etc ... . . 
it 's simply the course of history repeating itself . 
Einstein said World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones ... well just look around you . 
If you assume for a second that the so called `` allies '' of the U.S. or even the members of the so called security council are allied with the U.S. by choice , then you are gravely mistaken . 
These countries under different circumstances would turn against the U.S. in a heartbeat . 
The main culprit of our present global design is the great Winston Churchill . 
The entire middle east and Africa was carved out in London ... . 
remember the Sykes Picot Agreement of 1916 ? 
Think Lawrence of Arabia , General Allenby , Prince Faisal I of Arabia -LRB- not Saudi Arabia ... and you wonder why the west till this very day have a `` close '' relationship with the Faisals of Saudi Arabia . 
While this is not a lesson on history , my point is to remember that none of this is new ... . 
empires go to Deathistan to DIE ! 
What a relief -- finding a blog and commentary where people can spell . 
It 's a tricky proposition , ending participation in an entire slice of the world . 
It is hard to imagine a way to stop military outcomes unless you do that . 
Mind you , a little more honesty on the political scene could be helpful , and might help international folk gain a better understanding of just where the US of A sits in all this . 
How about a robust discussion at Presidential level , on the value and application of democracy , regime change , parallel societies , energy , power and Oil Wars ? 
When you are the biggest Alpha Male in the group there 's nothing wrong with saying `` i see it all like ` this ' , and you may not agree with my decisions but i was elected to make those decisions '' . 
Politically , it may be a form of suicide but it would certainly shake up the global chatfest scene . 
As an Australian peeking into -LRB- predominantly -RRB- US discussion forums , it 's hard not to come away with the impression that all attempts at discussion quickly get diluted into a Republican\/Democrat stand-off . 
Again , the commentary on this blog seems to be different in that regard , and this makes me feel more positive on American intellectualism than i have felt for quite a while . 
Apologies for a chatty post . 
It can be reduced to a suggestion that America can not ignore its place in the global scene , nor pretend it is not a superpower that has to juggle fiercely competing imperatives . 
It just needs to be more open on why it does what it does , and take any flak that my fly as a result . 
Not that i 'm an expert ... but i 'm just sayin ' ... It could n't be that their religious believe doom them to generations of failure . 
Institutional crouption ... has nothing to do with it . 
It is all the west 's fault ... though they beat and murder their own women and children under a crude `` moral '' code . 
Up next the West holds down the African nations whose tribal beliefs have nothing to do with their amoral living . 
Westerners who arrive in these place are successful , but people like Mugabe are the fault of the west . 
Why not place blame where it belongs ... no different why the Germans are successful and the Belgian 's with dysfunctional and corrupt ways are continuously unsuccessful !

2011-03-23,"If in Libya , why not also in Ivory Coast ? 
When Ivory Coast s election last year left the country with two men claiming to be president and a flood of warnings of the threat of civil war , the world s diplomatic and media interest was unprecedented . 
After a turbulent four months , which have seen two North African revolutions , a tsunami and near nuclear meltdown in Japan , and Libya s ongoing war , how that has changed . 
The West African nation s crisis is grizzly but also in a slow-burn mode and hardly getting a look in with all the drama elsewhere . 
The international recognition of Alassane Ouattara as victor and sanctions slapped on his rival , incumbent Laurent Gbagbo , who refuses to step down , are still in place . 
But so is Gbagbo , and Ouattara remains holed up in a hotel , protected by a ring of United Nations peacekeepers . 
Threats , made by West Africa s ECOWAS bloc , to oust him have rung hollow . 
Scores of people have since been killed , hundreds of thousands of have fled their homes amid heavy fighting and rights groups are warning crimes against humanity may have already taken place . 
Both sides have been accused of abuses but the most serious charges including the killing of women protestors calling for Gbagbo to leave have been levelled at Gbagbo . 
One was even been caught on camera , here , but Gbagbo 's camp has denied responsibility . 
The country s economy has disintegrated while the IMF warns the regional one is in peril . 
The long-flagged war has , arguably , already begun . 
Yet , it appears there are only so many crises the world can handle at any one time and , right now , television cameras and diplomats are looking elsewhere . 
Nigeria s foreign minister has accused the international community of double standards by imposing the no-fly zone in Libya while doing little in Ivory Coast . 
Liberia , still recovering from its own conflict , is struggling to raise funds it needs to deal with the refugees it is now taking in . 
Ouattara has scolded his U.N. backers for not doing enough to protect civilians . 
With a crisis like Libya taking place , is it only natural that Ivory Coast should drop down the agenda ? 
Civilians in Ivory Coast , where there is a U.N. peacekeeping mission with a robust mandate , have also been promised protection . 
Yet , so far , no robust action has been taken , even though the U.N. has accused pro-Gbagbo forces of using heavy weapons against civilians in Abidjan . 
What is the difference between Ivory Coast and Libya ? 
Is it just the scale of the abuses or are there other factors at play ? 
Some analysts and this blogger say Libya s oil makes it more important than Ivory Coast , the world 's top cocoa grower . 
The African Union had only just finally ironed out internal divisions over supporting Ouattara when it then had to set up another crisis team to deal with Libya . 
It is wary about too robust an intervention in either case and was still speaking out against military intervention in Libya even after a U.N. resolution had authorised it , and the Western forces had fired their first shots . 
Can the AU play a meaningful role in resolving Ivory Coast s crisis . 
If so , what ? 
Earlier today I was asking myself the same question and it is very hard to not imagine that oil is more important to the world that chocolate , why else would the events in Libya be attracting so much more attention than similar atrocities being committed on African 's across the continent . 
What worries me is that the winds of change are blowing but more often than not the response will be that of Libya and the World 's policemen -LRB- US , UN , NATO , EU , etc. -RRB- can not be in all the places they will be needed at the same time . 
The AU in my opinion is rather pointless and too often seems to want to fall back on ex-South African president Thabo Mbeki 's ` quiet diplomacy ' ! 
Simple the two scenario are not same ; Libyan people started the move in Tripoli , while UN is orchestrating what is happening in Ivory Coast . 
Nations should be allowed without any form of inducement or cohesion to settle their problem internally . 
Election dispute in Ivory Coast would have been a thing of the past if UN had not taken side in the dispute . 
Maybe the UN verdict into the elections was not perfect and there were problems from both sides . 
However , peace is nearly always better than war . 
I admire those leaders who have preferred to step down , even if they do n't think the outcome was fully fair , rather than see a lot of bloodshed . 
A leader 's position should never be more important than the lives , safety and futures of the people . 
Are values not more important than power ? 
Is the western world really interested in saving the libyan population ? 
They are just looking after the Libyan oil . 
If saving the people was really important , they should be going to Cote divoire where Gbagbo is killing his own people every single day just to stay in power . 
unfortunately there 's no oil in Cote dIvoire . 
world should oppose ongoing western air strikes launched against Libya on the ground that ordinary Libyans would be affected and the air attacks would prove counterproductive to the US ' purported humanitarian objective . 
there are many other hot spots around the world would US do the same . 
In fact as per records US has never been seen saving lives where they matter most . 
The video of the female protesters being killed is disturbing . 
Those unarmed women were not a threat to anyone . 
Someone did not like what they were saying or perhaps more accurately , someone did n't like that those women decided that they had a right to voice their opinions .

2011-03-24,"CNN Student News - 3\/25\/11 Download PDF maps related to today 's show : THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . 
CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Fridays are awesome ! 
Thank you for rounding out your week with CNN Student News . 
I 'm Carl Azuz , here to pilot you through 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines . 
AZUZ : First up , United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says there are no signs of a cease-fire in Libya . 
That announcement came yesterday , one week after the U.N. Security Council voted to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . 
That 's part of the military operation that 's been firing missiles and running airstrikes . 
It 's been led by the U.S. Yesterday , there was talk of a deal that would make NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the leader of the operation . 
But that was n't set in stone , and there was some doubt about it . 
One interesting point about the conflict in Libya is how it could affect gas prices in the U.S. Libya produces about 2 percent of the world 's crude oil ; it 's not very much . 
But some stock traders are afraid that the trouble there could happen in other countries that produce more oil . 
That fear is one reason why oil prices are rising in the stock market . 
And that means gas prices are more likely to increase too , since crude oil accounts for about 65 percent of what we spend on gas . 
Now , getting back to the military operation . 
Diana Magnay is on the ship that some of those airstrikes are launching from . 
She gives an idea of what life is like there . 
DIANA MAGNAY , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Each night they fly , Harrier jets off the USS Kearsarge , bound for Libya . 
U.S. strike missions to take out Gadhafi 's air defense and attack capabilities as rebels clash with Gadhafi 's forces . 
CAPTAIN MIKE WYRSCH , HARRIER FIGHTER PILOT : It was pretty neat the next day after the first attacks , to see that the rebel forces , their morale once they saw that they had people coming to help them out . 
But it 's breaking their supply chains as well as slowing down their advance onto Benghazi by taking out their tanks and artillery . 
MAGNAY : Day times are about maintenance and repair , checking over these V-22 Ospreys , which had their first outing in Operation Odyssey Dawn early Tuesday morning . 
A daring rescue mission with a team of 30 Marines to find a U.S. fighter pilot who ejected over eastern Libya after his F-15 fighter jet suffered what the military called mechanical failure . 
The pilot 's back in the medical facilities here on board . 
His other crew member , the weapons officer , also had to eject , but landed in a completely different location . 
So , he was rescued first by rebel forces and is now back on a U.S. Air Force base in northern Italy . 
There are around 700 Marines on board , but this is n't a war which involves coalition ground forces . 
The Kearsarge 's six Harrier jets taking the active role in enforcing the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone REAR ADMIRAL MARGARET KLEIN , COMMANDER , EXPEDITIONARY STRIKE GROUP FIVE : If there are vehicles on the ground that can shoot down our aircraft which are enforcing the no-fly zone , we consider that a legal mandate to be able attack that equipment . 
MAGNAY : Precision targeting , 500-pound laser-guided bombs , and the sorties continue . 
No sign here that this part of the offensive is over yet . 
Diana Magnay , CNN , on the Kearsarge in the Mediterranean . 
AZUZ : Syria is the latest country to deal with the political unrest that we 've seen around the Middle East and North Africa recently . 
Syria is located between Iraq and Turkey . 
And people there have been protesting over economic and human rights issues . 
Those demonstrations have gotten violent in the past few days , with protesters and security forces fighting on the streets of at least one city . 
Human rights workers say at least 34 people have been killed in the violence this week . 
And that includes a soldier who was reportedly shot because he refused to fire on the protesters . 
Thousands of people came out on Thursday for the funerals of that soldier and some of the other people who 've been killed . 
AZUZ : Toyota , the car company , might shut down some of its U.S. manufacturing temporarily because it does n't have enough parts . 
There 's been a delay in getting those parts from Japan because of Japan 's recent earthquake and tsunami . 
Inside Japan , workers are still trying to get things stabilized at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . 
These pictures were taken inside the plant . 
Two of the workers were taken to the hospital yesterday after they accidentally stepped in contaminated water . 
Officials say the men could be all right if they 're quickly decontaminated . 
A U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is going through a similar process right now . 
Martin Savidge , you 're on deck . 
MARTIN SAVIDGE , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Right now , every piece of hardware , every aircraft and every piece of machinery used to move that aircraft is on the front of the USS Ronald Reagan . 
And you can see a lot of the crew hands . 
You 're wondering maybe why are they all sitting around ? 
Well , we 'll show you . 
Look what 's going on back over here : water . 
Lots and lots of water just being sprayed all over the deck right now , in what is probably the biggest cleanup effort you 're ever likely to see at sea . 
AZUZ : You ca n't help scrub down the deck of the Ronald Reagan . 
But you can support the victims of these natural disasters in Japan .

TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Mielke 's world cultures classes at Gorzycki Middle School in Austin , Texas ! 
What type of food is a peanut ? 
You know what to do ! 
Is it a : A -RRB- Grain , B -RRB- Legume , C -RRB- Fruit or D -RRB- Tuber ? 
You 've got three seconds -- GO ! 
And here 's another interesting fact : peanuts are not technically nuts ! 
That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : They 're trying to take away all our rights . 
JASON CARROLL , CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Protesters picketing outside a school in Edgewater , Florida . 
Their signs showing how a medical problem for one of the school 's students has turned into a controversy that has some parents calling for that student 's removal . 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We are not attacking the child or the parents . 
CARROLL : At issue , rules the school put in place to protect the six-year-old girl who has a life-threatening peanut allergy . 
Lunches must be left outside the room . 
Students must wash their hands before entering the room and after lunch . 
At one point , students were also required to rinse out their mouths . 
Parents debating whether the rules infringe on the rights of students and take time away from education . 
Everybody has the right to an education , so I do n't see what the problem is . 
CARROLL : A district administrator says the rules must be enforced because the student 's allergy is considered a disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act . 
More districts could soon face a similar situation . 
The Centers for Disease Control says food allergies are on the rise . 
From 1997 to 2007 , reports of food allergies increased almost 20 percent among children under 18 years old . 
DR. SCOTT SICHERER , PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS , MT. SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE : It 's always necessary to have precautions for a young child who has a food allergy . 
There might be specific procedures that need to be in place to just really ensure that that child does n't end up eating the food that they 're allergic to . 
Sound off on our blog ! 
AZUZ : All right , time for you to sound off about this story . 
Do you think the school policy 's appropriate , or do you agree with those parents who say it 's unfair ? 
Head to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com . 
Tell us what you think . 
Remember , there 's a big rule on our blog : first names only . 
Please do n't give us any more info than that . 
AZUZ : In honor of Women 's History Month , we have a quick quiz to test your knowledge . 
Who was the first female ever appointed to serve on the United States Supreme Court ? 
Was it : Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Sonia Sotomayor , Sandra Day O'Connor or Elena Kagan ? 
The answer : Justice Sandra Day O'Connor served nearly 25 years on the U.S. Supreme Court after being sworn in on the 25th of September , 1981 . 
In fact , tomorrow is her 81st birthday . 
Be sure to check out all of our Women 's History Month materials .

AZUZ : Finally today , I get sore just thinking about a marathon ; most runners are sore after running one . 
But Captain Ivan Castro does n't mind . 
He was injured while serving in Iraq and lost his eyesight . 
Now , every step is a reminder that he is still alive . 
After the attack , Captain Castro says it took three people to help him stand up . 
Last weekend , he finished a full marathon . 
And the only help he needed was his running partner , who helped him navigate the course with a string tied around their wrists . 
AZUZ : It was an amazing accomplishment . 
And it 's time for CNN Student News to hit the road . 
We hope to run into you right back here on Monday for more CNN Student News . 
Until then , have a great weekend .

2011-03-24,"By the CNN Wire Staff Doctors treat a wounded fighter in a Ras Lanuf hospital March 6 . 
Medics in Misrata have complained of a lack of anesthesia . 
A doctor tells CNN that 109 people were killed in Misrata over the past week More than 1,300 people have been wounded The hospital only has 60 beds and doctors are operating in corridors -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For days , the wounded just kept coming to the 60-bed central hospital in Misrata , a city under siege from forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
But there were no empty beds , no electricity -- only generator power . 
No anesthesia or painkillers . 
A doctor said 109 people have died in Misrata over the past week . 
Six were killed Thursday by Gadhafi 's rooftop snipers -- unseen but too often precise . 
More than 1,300 others have been wounded since the protests erupted in the western city last month . 
People flooded the hospital , wounded in war that has raged between the opposition and Gadhafi 's forces . 
The strongman 's tanks have been pounding the city and bombs fell Thursday near the hospital , the doctor said . 
Residents reported a reprieve after coalition airstrikes targeted the Libyan military . 
But rooftop snipers kept taking aim . 
And the doctors kept doing their work . 
Snipers surround hospital in Misrata Libyan govt . 
media trip goes wrong Gadhafi tanks turned into wreckage They treated patients in corridors , and operated on them even without anesthesia . 
They sent people with what the doctor called lesser injuries home to recuperate -- including people whose legs and arms were amputated . 
`` We do n't have the space , '' he said , the weariness in his voice apparent even on a poor phone connection from Libya . 
Snipers surrounded the hospital , he said . 
Thursday , patients were to a clinic . 
But the injured in the city could no longer seek help at the hospital . 
The snipers were shooting at the ambulances . 
The coalition began airstrikes last Saturday and has been able to establish a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya 's coastline . 
But Gadhafi 's forces are far from defeated . 
They camped on the periphery of Misrata , trying to wrest it from opposition control , and leaving its people , including those at the central hospital , in a dire situation . 
"
2011-03-24,"By Chris Lawrence and Pam Benson , CNN Libyans gather March 21 at a site near Benghazi where Gadhafi 's forces were targeted by a French air strike . 
Gadhafi 's elite ground forces are well-paid , well-equipped Those troops fight within cities , where coalition ca n't easily get them Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Libyan military has been pounded by coalition airstrikes neutralizing its air capabilities but it is still able to fight and maneuver on the ground , U.S. officials said . 
The Libyan Air Force has been grounded after five days of operations by the coalition forces . 
More than 160 Tomahawk missiles and several hundred strikes from fighter jets have virtually destroyed Moammar Gadhafi 's air defense . 
The toll on the air system is `` to the point where we can operate with near impunity across Libya , '' said Vice Marshall Greg Bagwell of Britain 's Royal Air Force . 
Despite the targeting of mobile launchers , Libyan forces still have numerous mobile launchers that could pose a risk to coalition planes . 
What does Libya 's military have left ? 
Gadhafi tanks turned into wreckage Haas on Libya : ` Extraordinarily messy ' Preparing for battle in Libya But it 's the ground forces where Gadhafi has more maneuverability because of the coalition 's limitations in fighting Libyan forces only from the air . 
Gadhafi 's forces have retreated from the eastern city of Benghazi , but continue to fight in other cities including Misrata and Ajabiya using `` tanks , artillery , rocket launchers , '' according to Rear Adm. Gerard Hueber , chief of staff for the coalition Odyssey Dawn . 
The coalition is able to strike at forces moving toward cities , but once they are inside city limits , dropping bombs with enough precision to avoid civilian casualties is difficult . 
Before the war , Libya had about 500 mortars and 2,400 pieces of artillery . 
Gadhafi had close to 2,000 tanks and armored vehicles to move around , but much was poorly maintained . 
Libya 's elite forces come from tribes loyal to Gadhafi , dedicated to protecting the regime . 
The 32nd Brigade , for instance , is commanded by one of Gadhafi 's sons . 
Those forces total , at most , 10,000 men . 
They are better paid and better equipped , said Gawdat Bahgat , a military analyst at National Defense University , with tanks and conventional weapons . 
Those elite forces are on the offense . 
U.S. surveillance planes have seen some attacks by the elite units . 
`` Those forces are fully engaged in this conflict , that are attacking those civilian populations , '' Hueber said . 
The Gadhafi forces remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , a U.S. official told CNN . 
They are relatively well organized and continue to fight effectively in certain parts of the country , said the unnamed official , who is not authorized to speak on the record . 
The rebels have gained some additional battle space due to coalition efforts , the official said . 
Rebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago , but the Gadhafi forces have the upper edge at this point in time , the official said . 
However , where possible , the coalition is hitting the forces on the ground , arguing it is within the mission of protecting civilians . 
`` Gadhafi 's forces are feeling the strain of several weeks of fighting without any resupply , '' the official said . 
`` In Ajdabiya to Misurata , our targeted priorities are mechanized forces , those mobile integrated -- those mobile surface-to-air missile sites , interdicting their lines of communications which supply their beans and their bullets , their command-and-control , and any opportunities for sustainment of that activity , '' Hueber said Wednesday .

2011-03-24,"Angel Rabasa : U.S. should arm the Libyan rebels so they can resist Gadhafi 's forces He says a similar move in Bosnia helped end that conflict U.S. should recognize Benghazi government as the legitimate ruler of Libya He says involvement on the side of democracy in Libya would be good for the U.S. Editor 's note : Angel M. Rabasa , a member of the Bosnia Train and Equip Task Force in the early 1990s , is a senior political scientist at the RAND Corp. , a nonprofit institution whose mission is to help improve policy and decision-making through research and analysis . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The no-fly zone and air strikes on military targets of the Gadhafi regime bear close parallels to events in Bosnia in autumn , 1995 , when NATO air strikes and the threat of further attacks halted the Bosnian Serb military onslaught against Bosnian Muslim targets . 
If effective , the international action might prevent the Gadhafi forces from crushing the rebellion in Libya , but it will not end the conflict . 
The Gadhafi regime retains overwhelming military superiority over the Benghazi-based Interim National Council . 
Unless the military imbalance is redressed , Gadhafi will retain the ability to threaten or renew his attacks on his opposition . 
As long as this situation persists , international military involvement in Libya -- to enforce the no-fly zone and prevent ground attacks by Gadhafi 's forces -- will likely have to continue . 
What the United States did in Bosnia might hold the key for an effective response to the crisis in Libya . 
In Bosnia , the United States sought to redress the military balance , which since the onset of the war in 1992 had heavily favored the Bosnian Serb army . 
Should coalition support Libyan rebels ? 
What could be the end game in Libya ? 
Despite the Europeans ' skepticism and dislike for the program , it succeeded . 
The program raised donations of several hundred million dollars from Muslim countries , supervised the purchase of military equipment for the armed forces of the Federation and arranged for a U.S. contractor to train Federation troops . 
The program also helped promote other U.S. objectives in Bosnia by diminishing Iranian influence and ensuring the departure of the foreign fighters . 
The situations in Bosnia then and Libya now grow more alike as the violence in Libya evolves into prolonged conflict . 
Despite establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya , there is little reason to expect that air or naval power alone will dislodge Gadhafi from areas he controls . 
The U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the no-fly zone and all necessary measures to protect civilians under attack in Libya did not call for Gadhafi 's ouster . 
There are reports that some Arab countries are considering deploying ground troops to Libya . 
But if they do , their role would likely be protection of the civilian population in areas outside Gadhafi 's control . 
That outcome would still leave Gadhafi in power in western Libya . 
That leaves few effective options if the United States wants to prevent the crisis in Libya from leading to a prolonged armed conflict or de facto partition that leaves a ruthless , embittered dictator with a terrorist record in control of half the country . 
That situation could have long-term destabilizing consequences for Libya and the Middle East . 
The way out of this conundrum would be for the United States to clarify its goals in Libya . 
Recognizing that lasting stability could only come about as the result of the removal of Gadhafi from power , the United States and like-minded countries could begin by recognizing the Benghazi government as the legitimate government of Libya . 
The Libyan National Council is , after all , a government set up by a popular uprising against tyranny and therefore inherently more legitimate than Gadhafi 's government in Tripoli . 
The United States also might consider launching an effort to provide the Benghazi government with arms and equipment to defend itself against Gadhafi 's forces and to help it liberate western Libya . 
The U.S. need not become directly involved in the training and equipping of the Libyan opposition . 
As with the Bosnia train and equip program , a small U.S. team could help arrange for the purchase and delivery of arms , as well as supply training , possibly by third parties . 
There are those who would caution that the United States does not know enough about the Libyan opposition to support it , but this is not entirely true . 
Some of the opposition leaders are former cabinet ministers and generals in the Libyan government , known to the United States and its allies . 
As in all revolutions , a few of Libya 's opposition leaders have emerged from the rank and file of protesters . 
Some may be Islamists , but this was also true in Bosnia during that war . 
If the U.S. were to simply stand aside , extremists could fill the gap , as occurred in the early days of the Bosnian war . 
The U.S. decision to support victims of aggression paid off in Bosnia and advanced America 's interests and values . 
Involvement on the side of the democracy movement in Libya would enable the United States to exercise a positive influence on Libya 's evolution and prevent destabilizing outcomes .

2011-03-24,"WASHINGTON | Thu Mar 24 , 2011 6:29 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The White House rejected criticism of President Barack Obama 's decision to attack Libya , saying on Thursday he had briefed Congress and the public extensively before military action began last weekend . 
Four senior administration officials , including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates , will also brief House members on Libya next Wednesday , a House leadership aide said on Thursday . 
The aide said the closed-door , classified briefing , which will also involve Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , came at the request of House Speaker John Boehner , who asked Obama in a letter on Wednesday how he would measure success in Libya and whether Muammar Gaddafi had to depart as its leader before the U.S. military involvement ends . 
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters the administration had consulted repeatedly with Congress and read off a long list of meetings and briefings that the administration had already held for lawmakers . 
`` It 's part of his responsibility as president on an issue like this to consult with members of Congress , and he has done that . 
He has instructed senior staff here to do that , and we have in a very substantial way consulted with Congress and will continue to do that , '' Carney said . 
He refused to let reporters interrupt him , saying , `` It 's important that the American people understand how much consultation there has been . '' 
Obama would be commenting publicly on Libya `` with relative frequency and relatively soon , '' Carney added . 
Criticism of Obama for not consulting more with lawmakers before launching the Libyan operation has come from across the political spectrum . 
Many liberals in Obama 's Democratic Party oppose a third war in the Muslim world on top of U.S. troop commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
Republicans say the White House did not adequately explain the mission before it began . 
Carney said Obama could not have waited for Congress to return from a recess because he needed to act quickly to prevent a massacre of Gaddafi 's opponents in Benghazi . 
`` American military action , international military action has saved an enormous number of lives in the past five days , and that is something that Americans should be very proud of , '' Carney said . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
`` American military action , international military action has saved an enormous number of lives in the past five days , and that is something that Americans should be very proud of , '' Carney said . '' 
Sorry Carney , the law says that the congress must approve US military action . 
The only exception is if the US is under attack , or faces an imminent attack . 
Libya 's civil war posed no threat to the United States . 
Kucinich even said this is an impeachable offense .

2011-03-25,"By Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister , CNN Yusuf al Qaradawi -LRB- shown in 2007 -RRB- , an Egyptian preacher in Qatar , is widely viewed as the Muslim Brotherhood 's spiritual guide . 
The Brotherhood in Libya is energized by the sudden upheaval sweeping the Arab world It says it has no organizational links with the Brotherhood elsewhere It is largely drawn from educated middle classes in Tripoli and Benghazi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. Abdulmonem Hresha knows first hand how Moammar Gadhafi 's regime works . 
He says the seeds of his opposition were sown when he was age 10 . 
He and classmates were taken to witness the public execution of a political opponent of Gadhafi . 
`` They hung him up in front of thousands of small kids , '' Hresha said . 
`` He did that to scare people . '' 
Hresha , who taught physics at Tripoli University , later fled to Canada . 
A central , open question about Libya The prominent member of the Muslim Brotherhood now lives in London , and anticipates the group could become an important player in a post-Gadhafi environment . 
As in Egypt and Tunisia , the Brotherhood in Libya has been energized by the sudden upheaval sweeping the Arab world . 
It says it has no organizational links with the Brotherhood elsewhere , but shares the philosophy of the pan-Arab Islamist movement founded in Egypt in the 1920s . 
Largely drawn from the devout educated middle classes and university campuses in Tripoli and Benghazi , the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood was founded in the mid-1950s . 
Islamist opposition to the Libyan regime gathered force in the late 1980s , as part of a wider Islamic awakening or `` Sahwa '' in the region and in reaction to what many saw as an attempt by Gadhafi to hijack and interpret Islam for his own purposes . 
While jihadists launched a brief but unsuccessful campaign to overthrow Gadhafi in the 1990s , the Brotherhood focused much of its efforts on clandestine preaching and social welfare efforts in Libya .0 In 1998 , Gadhafi 's security services launched a crackdown against the group that saw more than 200 members imprisoned and hundreds more forced into exile , including Hresha . 
Despite years of repression , Hresha claims the Brotherhood still has thousands of members scattered across Libya , with chapters in almost every single town , including Sirte , Gadhafi 's birthplace on the coast west of Tripoli . 
In 2006 , its leaders were released after reconciling with the Libyan regime . 
But now the Brotherhood is siding with the rebellion . 
In February , as protests in Libya began , Yusuf al Qaradawi -- an Egyptian preacher in Qatar widely viewed as the Muslim Brotherhood 's chief spiritual guide -- issued a fatwa or religious ruling obliging any Libyan soldier who had the opportunity to do so to assassinate the leader . 
Fighting on Libya 's front lines Should coalition support Libyan rebels ? 
Al-Amin Bilhaj , a leading figure in the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood and the President of the Muslim Association of Britain -LRB- MAB -RRB- recently traveled to Benghazi , the headquarters of the rebel movement , according to Hresha . 
Other Brotherhood exiles have returned to help treat the wounded in hospitals , according to Kemal el Helbawy , the Egyptian founder of the British association . 
There is little or no overt presence of the Brotherhood in Benghazi , according to CNN 's Arwa Damon , who has been there for most of the month . 
But in the longer term , in a country where the political space has been dominated by Gadhafi for more than 40 years , the Brotherhood 's organization and nationwide presence may afford it an advantage . 
The West has nothing to fear from the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya , according to Hresha . 
Like their counterparts in Egypt , they would embrace multiparty democracy . 
`` I 've lived for many years in Canada and the UK , and that 's exactly the political system that we want , '' Hresha said . 
Hresha says that if his organization forms a political party , it would seek to legislate according to Koranic principles , which would include , for example , a continued ban on the sale of alcohol . 
`` Why should n't we be able to press our point of view -- we are humans too , '' he said . 
Hresha said the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood welcomes airstrikes in Libya , a startling turnaround for a movement that previously supported jihad by Iraqis against U.S. forces occupying Iraq . 
`` I salute and am very grateful to the Americans , French and British governments for stopping the killing , '' he said . 
`` I will never forget this . '' 
Hresha said he hopes a post-Gadhafi Libya will be a close friend to the West . 
A more prominent role for the Brotherhood in Libya could dent support for al Qaeda and other jihadist groups , especially in eastern provinces that have witnessed significant radicalization in recent years . 
But Libya 's deeply tribal structures -- unlike Egypt and Tunisia -- may complicate its efforts to build a national base . 
And hardline `` Salafi '' preachers have gained influence in neglected towns like Derna -- on the coast near the border with Egypt . 
`` Conservative imams -LRB- in Derna -RRB- , '' a U.S. diplomat wrote in 2008 , `` deliberately sought to eliminate the few social activities on offer for young people to monopolize the social and cultural environment . '' 
But in the end , the reach of the Brotherhood may be most limited by the emergence of secular forces at the forefront of the rebel movement . 
The Interim National Council in Benghazi -- a 30-member opposition leadership -- is mostly made up of lawyers , doctors , intellectuals and former political prisoners with a secular bent . 
In a statement Monday , the Council stated the ultimate goal of the revolution was `` to build a constitutional democratic civil state based on the rule of law , respect for human rights and the guarantee of equal rights and opportunities for all its citizens including ... equal opportunities between men and women and the promotion of women empowerment . '' 
Guma el-Gamaty , a Libyan academic based in the UK who has emerged as a key liaison between the Libyan opposition overseas and the Benghazi Council said no Muslim Brotherhood leaders had yet been appointed to the Council , and played down their influence . 
Hresha , the long-time Brotherhood member , expects that to change . 
`` We 've been working secretly till this moment , '' he said .

2011-03-25,"By the CNN Wire Staff `` Large degree of success '' in mission , U.S. general says Gadhafi still trying to reinforce positions near eastern city , Pentagon says Libya calls on African Union to monitor cease-fire Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO has agreed in principle to take the lead in protecting Libyan civilians , said the top commander of a U.S. mission that also is handing over control of a no-fly zone in the war-torn country . 
Gen. Carter Ham , commander of U.S. Africa Command , also said on CNN 's `` The Situation Room '' Friday that removing leader Moammar Gadhafi by military means is not the aim of the mission and that the coalition is not arming rebel forces . 
And the general claimed `` we have achieved already a large degree of success '' -- including an arms embargo , the no-fly zone and the halting of loyalist troops near the rebel-held city of Benghazi . 
President Barack Obama will update the nation at 7:30 p.m. ET Monday from the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington , D.C. , the White House announced . 
NATO this weekend is expected to take over control of the no-fly zone from the United States and finalize procedures on protecting civilians . 
But Ham acknowledged that challenges remain . 
NATO prepares to take over Libya mission Bullets fired into Libyan maternity ward `` We find these regime forces taking cover inside built-up areas where they know -- because of our concern for civilian casualties -- that we wo n't strike in there , '' he told CNN 'S Wolf Blitzer . 
Loyalist snipers , along with armored units , continue to be a threat . 
`` It is a tough , tough challenge for us , '' said Ham , speaking from Stuttgart , Germany . 
`` When we see regime forces attacking civilians , we will do everything we can to stop those attacks . '' 
Not long after allies unleashed cruise missiles against Gadhafi air defenses last Saturday , Obama told Americans he wanted the United States , which has headed the military campaign , to hand over control of the enforcement of a U.N. Security Council resolution . 
The resolution called for the protection of Libyan civilians and the enforcement of the no-fly zone . 
NATO , which includes the United States , will lead both efforts . 
The United States has been treating the protection of civilians as part of the mission , and that activity will continue regardless of the command structure , Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said . 
`` Job one is to protect the Libyan people and the job does n't change because we have a new boss , '' he said , briefing reporters at the Pentagon . 
Fighting on Libya 's front lines Obama on Friday conducted a conference call and meeting with congressional leaders to provide an update on the conflict and attempt to address their concerns about the mission 's organization , cost and consequences . 
Democrats appeared more satisfied than Republicans . 
Meanwhile , coalition fighter planes in a 24-hour period took out seven Libyan tanks it claims were threatening civilian populations , including in the city of Ajdabiya , authorities said Friday . 
Although Gadhafi is feeling the pinch of more than 850 air sorties , the `` regime is still able and still determined to reinforce their positions , '' Gortney said . 
British Tornado fighter jets identified Libyan tanks with their weapons pointed north toward Ajdabiya and destroyed them , Air Vice Marshal Phil Osborn said Friday . 
The British military released video of two such tanks bursting into flames and smoke . 
The United Arab Emirates , meanwhile , announced it will send 12 aircraft in the coming days to help patrol and enforce the United Nations-mandated no-fly zone . 
And Turkey , once wary of military operations , agreed to the use of an eastern air base in Izmir as a sub-command station . 
Other Muslim nations participating in the Libya mission include Qatar , which will begin flying planes this weekend , and Kuwait and Jordan , which have agreed to provide humanitarian or logistical support . 
But as the military operation continues , the situation for Libyans caught in battle zones grows more dire by the day , humanitarian agencies reported . 
The United Nations refugee agency said Friday that increasing numbers of Libyans are displaced from their homes due to fighting . 
Refugees streaming out of Ajdabiya described chilling scenes . 
`` I could n't even begin to describe to you the horror that I have seen , '' one man told CNN . 
`` Leaving Ajdabiya we saw dead bodies in the street . 
No one would ever dare go to recover them . '' 
CNN is not identifying Libyans it has interviewed for their own safety . 
Another man said Gadhafi 's troops were going house to house in Ajdabiya , hunting for opposition members . 
He said the troops took away five men from his neighbor 's house . 
He did n't know what happened to them . 
Early Friday , coalition warplanes roared again through Libyan skies , bombing the periphery of the capital where military bases are located . 
Anti-aircraft fire burst out but then fell silent . 
International reporters in Tripoli were escorted to farmlands east of Tripoli in Tajura , where Gadhafi 's government claims airstrikes killed civilians . 
Reporters found no evidence of civilian deaths . 
Two military bases along the way had been bombed and were still smoking Friday . 
In Tajura , missile fragments lay scattered about a palm orchard and shrapnel had peppered walls of still-standing farm buildings . 
One farmer told reporters that a missile landed about 8 p.m. Thursday , but there were no military installations nearby . 
The missile gouged a small hole in a palm tree and sprayed debris that damaged windows and doors of the farm buildings . 
Gadhafi has been keen to put out the word on collateral damage from the coalition 's airstrikes . 
International reporters were taken this week to a seaside cemetery in Tripoli where the funerals of 33 people allegedly killed in airstrikes were taking place . 
State television said the dead were victims of the `` crusader colonial aggression . '' 
CNN could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were . 
In Tripoli , CNN reporters go on government-organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting ; Libyan authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in Tripoli . 
The reports of civilian deaths have been given little credence by coalition forces . 
`` The only civilian casualties we know of for certain are the ones that the Libyan government itself has caused , '' Gortney has said . 
Instead , it is Gadhafi who is almost sure to face serious charges for his brutal crackdown on protesters , said a spokeswoman for the International Criminal Court . 
The prosecutor of the court is `` 100 percent '' certain Gadhafi will face charges of crimes against humanity once an investigation has been completed , the spokeswoman said . 
Meanwhile , the Libyan delegation attending an African Union meeting in Ethiopia said the country is committed to a cease-fire and is ready to let the African Union monitor one . 
`` We demand the cessation of the air bombardment and the naval blockade carried out by Western forces and the United States for the invalidity of its argument to protect civilians since it is killing them by the hundreds and is attacking and destroying our armed forces and paving the way for the other side to attack , '' said Mohammed al-Zwai , speaker of the Libyan People 's Assembly . 
Under an agreement reached Thursday , NATO forces will be able to close Libyan air space to all flights except humanitarian ones and will be able to use force in self-defense . 
Michael Burns , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , said he expects the defense alliance to take over command of the entire operation in a few days to keep up pressure on Gadhafi . 
The alliance said Friday that Canada 's Lt. Gen. Charlie Bouchard , stationed in Naples , Italy , will take the lead for the Libya mission . 
`` The no-flight zone alone can not protect the civilians of Libya , '' Burns told CNN . 
`` Gadhafi is still attacking . 
... He is still on the move in some places . '' 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he has seen no signs of the cease-fire called for under U.N. Resolution 1973 , which was hurriedly passed March 17 , as Libyan forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
`` To the contrary , fierce battles continue in and around the cities of Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zinan , '' Ban said Thursday , adding his envoy told Libyan authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease-fire resolution , `` the Security Council was prepared to take additional measures . '' 
The Libyan conflict was sparked in February by protests against Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
The strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend .

2011-03-25,"By the CNN Wire Staff All 28 NATO allies authorized a plan that includes civilian protection Transition to be complete by Sunday night , sources say Questions on rules of engagement remain to be worked out Brussels , Belgium -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO members agreed Thursday to take over enforcement of the no-fly zone over Libya , but stopped short of interpreting that mandate as a license to attack government troops who may be threatening unarmed civilians . 
`` What we have decided today is that NATO will enforce the no-fly zone , '' NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer from the organization 's headquarters in Brussels . 
Under Thursday 's agreement , NATO forces will be able to close air space to all flights except for humanitarian ones and will be able to use force in self-defense . 
NATO also has sent a directive to its military chain of command asking for a plan on how to execute an expanded role for enforcement of U.N. Resolution 1973 , according to NATO sources . 
Under what some officials were calling `` no-fly plus , '' NATO would be given more robust rules of engagement to ensure that civilians are protected , the sources said . 
And , in an effort to ease concerns from Turkey -- the organization 's sole Muslim country -- coalition forces would be allowed to withdraw from certain missions , such as those involving attacking Libyan soldiers , the sources said . 
media trip goes wrong Gadhafi tanks turned into wreckage What does Libya 's military have left ? 
Should coalition support Libyan rebels ? 
As for the prospect of a more robust mandate , one that the U.S.-led coalition has followed so far , `` That decision has not been made yet , '' Rasmussen said . 
He added that NATO will have outside help in whatever mission it opts to pursue . 
`` It 's of utmost importance to stress that this is not primarily a NATO operation , '' he said . 
`` It is a broad international effort in which we will include partners from the region that have pledged to contribute to this protection of civilians in Libya . '' 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who will travel to London to attend an international meeting on Libya on Tuesday , gave an upbeat assessment of what the coalition has accomplished in five days . 
`` We have made significant progress , '' she told reporters . 
`` A massacre in Benghazi was prevented . 
Gadhafi 's air force and air defenses have been rendered largely ineffective , and the coalition is in control of the skies above Libya . '' 
She welcomed the fact that the coalition includes aircraft and pilots from Qatar and Thursday 's announcement by the United Arab Emirates that it , too , would send planes to protect Libya 's civilians . 
`` In the days ahead , as NATO assumes command-and-control responsibilities , the welfare of those civilians will be of paramount concern , '' she said . 
`` This operation has already saved many lives , but the danger is far from over . '' 
Rasmussen said the issue did not represent a split in NATO over the mission . 
However , he also acknowledged that , if unaltered , the agreement would mean the overall mission would have two parts , with NATO enforcing the no-fly zone and the U.S.-led coalition handling a naval blockade and airstrikes . 
Thursday 's deal was reached after a conference call among Clinton and her counterparts from Britain , France and Turkey , according to diplomatic officials who spoke on condition of not being identified by name . 
So far , U.S. forces have shouldered the bulk of the mission , according to figures provided by the Pentagon . 
Of the 175 Tomahawk missiles fired , 168 were from the United States and seven from Great Britain , the only two countries to possess them , while U.S. planes have flown almost two-thirds of the sorties and U.S. ships comprise more than two-thirds of the total involved . 
The flurry of diplomatic activity came as the battle for control of Libya was continuing to unfold . 
After a fifth consecutive night of pounding by coalition jets , Libyans gathered at a seaside cemetery in Tripoli on Thursday for the funerals of 33 people Gadhafi 's government said were victims of an airstrike . 
State television said the dead were victims of the `` crusader colonial aggression . '' 
Earlier , a Libyan government official said coalition planes struck the suburb of Tajura and state TV showed images of fires , smoldering vehicles and the charred bodies of the dead . 
At the cemetery , anger trumped grief and Gadhafi 's message was loud and clear : innocent people were wrongly killed and the Libyan people will fight back . 
CNN could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were . 
In Tripoli , CNN reporters go on government-organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting ; Libyan authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in Tripoli . 
Fighting on Libya 's front lines White House answers Libya questions What could be the end game in Libya ? 
Military leaders talk U.S. role in Libya The reports of civilian deaths were given little credence by coalition forces , which launched airstrikes Thursday near Tripoli , Misrata and Ajdabiya in Libya . 
`` The only civilian casualties we know are for certain are the ones that the Libyan government itself has caused , '' U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said . 
At the United Nations , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he has seen no signs of a cease-fire by Libyan government authorities , as called for by U.N. Resolution 1973 , which was hurriedly passed last Thursday as Libyan forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
Ban told council members , `` to the contrary , fierce battles continue in and around the cities of '' Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zinan . 
He added that his envoy told Libyan authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease-fire resolution , `` the Security Council was prepared to take additional measures . '' 
Ban said he had sent his envoy to an African Union meeting to be held Friday in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , at which representatives of the Gadhafi government and the opposition were expected to attend . 
`` Their aim : to reach a cease-fire and political solution . '' 
But there was no sign that any such solution was near . 
The battle for Misrata , Libya 's third-largest city , has been ongoing for more than a week . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Thursday that many residents remain trapped in their homes without electricity and communications and with a dwindling supply of food and water . 
In the east , Gadhafi 's tanks were shelling Ajdabiya , where fighting had occurred the day before . 
Loyalist forces still controlled the northern and western gates to the city . 
`` This underlines the appalling danger its inhabitants would be in without coalition action , as do continued threats by Gadhafi forces to ` massacre ' residents in areas under bombardment , '' Hague said . 
The coalition has established a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya 's coast . 
French jets fired air-to-ground missiles on a Libyan combat aircraft Thursday that was in violation of the no-fly mandate , destroying it , the French Defense Ministry said . 
The plane was struck as it was landing in a Misrata airfield . 
The civil war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
The Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend . 
Though the rebels ' position may have improved since then , a U.S. official said Gadhafi 's forces still have the upper hand . 
They remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively , the official said .

2011-03-25,"Defense Secretary Robert Gates boards the `` Doomsday Plane '' as he wraps up a six-day trip to Russia and the Middle East . 
Robert Gates recently completed a six-day trip abroad He is due to step down at some point this year He has served eight presidents over his career Aboard A U.S. Military Aircraft -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates stepped out of a helicopter at Amman Airport in Jordan . 
He smiled at his staff and the cameras , raised his hands and said , `` Let 's go home . '' 
Moments later , the `` Doomsday Plane , '' his link to the Pentagon and the White House from wherever he is in the world , rolled down the tarmac and climbed into a sunny sky . 
The 67-year-old secretary is on his way out of government after serving eight presidents , but he has n't announced a departure date yet other than saying it will be this year . 
And these regular trips are intensive , long days for the former career intelligence professional -- walking the beat , embracing allies , bolstering morale and getting his own fix on the troubles of the day . 
Gates ended his latest overseas jaunt -- a six-day trip to Russia and the Middle East -- by traveling by helicopter from Amman Airport to Jordan 's Royal Palace for a private , no-cameras-allowed meeting with King Abdullah . 
He said privately , according to aides , what he had been saying publicly on the trip -- that the upheaval across the Middle East was serving up challenges and opportunities , and the key was to sort them out . 
Overshadowing his stops in Russia , Egypt and Israel was the U.S. and coalition military operation over Libya . 
He delayed his planned departure on this trip for a day at the start of the air attacks . 
Gen. Ham : We will not arm Libyan rebels Libya 's civil war making families homeless Will coalition forces target Gadhafi ? 
While in Russia , he found himself in the middle of a political dispute over the Libyan mission . 
Aides informed him when a U.S. fighter jet and two aviators went down and were rescued near Benghazi . 
He was briefed on every development as the U.S. Air Force and Navy led the airstrikes . 
And while many on his plane dozed or ate their meatloaf and mashed potatoes on the flight back to Washington on Friday , Gates was linked to the White House and a National Security Council conference call for the latest deliberations on the military , diplomatic and political calculus of enforcing the Libyan mission . 
Gates will make appearances on the Sunday talk show circuit and visit Capitol Hill in the coming days to offer public and private explanations of how the U.S. military performed . 
And perhaps he also will speak about his view of the future . 
But on the trip , in public statements , and in talking to traveling and local journalists , he was careful and diplomatic . 
He dispensed with each question about `` the endgame '' of the Libyan missions by saying the goals are clear : creation and enforcement of the no-fly zone and protection of Libyan civilians . 
About targeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , about working in concert with Libyan rebels , about the risk of a military stalemate , Gates would n't bite , saying the future there is for the Libyans themselves to decide . 
Gates told America 's Middle East allies that Washington stands by them . 
In Cairo , he repeated his praise for the Egyptian military for keeping that country from going over the brink in the mass protests that toppled President Hosni Mubarak just last month . 
He arrived in Israel just after a bus stop bombing in Jerusalem and continuing rocket attacks in the south . 
Gates repeated the standard line that the U.S. commitment was unshakeable and used the code words for continued aid , saying that the United States would ensure Israel 's qualitative military edge . 
On his last day , he moved briskly from photo-op to meetings . 
The first stop was the old Roman town of Caesarea , a luxury hotel where guests gawked at the motorcade and the heavily armed , plain-clothes Israeli agents standing watch . 
Inside , Gates met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who promised that the recent terrorism would be answered with what he called `` great force and great determination to put a stop to it . '' 
And there was also mention of the elusive goal of a peace agreement , with Netanyahu adding , `` we seek to establish security for the establishment of peace . '' 
Gates offered his condolences to the families of the victims of the terror attack and those enduring the rocket attacks in southern Israel . 
Next stop for Gates , after a wild convoy ride through Israeli traffic , was the West Bank , and a reminder of how many administrations have tried and failed to nudge the sides toward Mideast peace . 
Now in an armored SUV , he crossed over to newly constructed Palestinian Authority offices in Ramallah . 
In the diplomatic game , where symbols can substitute for substance , Gates acknowledged that his presence alone made history . 
`` I understand I 'm the first American secretary of defense to visit Ramallah , '' Gates told the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad . 
At the end of his remarks before the assembled media , before a 50-minute closed-door meeting , Gates added that he looked forward to discussing the central -- but elusive -- element of U.S. peace proposals for Israel and the Palestinians , a two-state solution . 
Later , in Ramallah , crowds of people leaving a mosque at the end of Friday prayers watched the Gates convoy glide past , as the secretary raced on to his next meeting and on to Washington .

2011-03-25,"The situation is dire for Libya 's war displaced Tune in to `` AC360 '' for the latest on NATO 's command over the `` no-fly '' operation in Libya . 
Watch `` AC360 '' at 10 p.m. ET Friday on CNN . 
Ajdabiya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Outside the Libyan city of Ajdabiya , tents have sprouted in the rolling desert , where the sands blow and farmers grow figs and grapes . 
In the city , a fierce fight rages for control between the Libyan opposition and forces loyal to strongman Moammar Gadhafi , whose tanks lob shells to push their foes back . 
At night , coalition planes roar overhead , pounding Gadhafi 's positions . 
Early Friday , British jets pounded Libyan armored vehicles . 
But they have not been able to stop the battle on the ground , and residents are escaping to safer ground . 
`` I could n't even begin to describe to you the horror that I have seen , '' one man said . 
`` Leaving Ajdabiya , we saw dead bodies in the street . 
No one would ever dare go to recover them . '' 
He fled his hometown with his six children this week . 
One of his sons , maybe about 10 , cradles his head as his father talks . 
Other children gather around . 
When an oil tanker barrels down the road , they freeze and then scatter in fear . 
The people here have nothing : no change of clothes , not even water . 
They sleep on thin sheets of plastic and think they will keep themselves warm at night with firewood in a tin box that is only 1 foot in diameter . 
They keep hoping that when the next morning comes , they will be able to trek back through the barren land to their homes . 
But every morning brings more of the same . 
Two trucks arrive from Benghazi to the north . 
They bring rice , sugar , powdered milk for babies . 
The people say the aid materialized from the goodwill of their compatriots in Benghazi . 
Relief , however little . 
As the Libyan war goes on , humanitarian agencies report increasing numbers of Libyans displaced from their homes . 
The International Medical Corps estimates that 20,000 people have taken refuge in a small town east of Ajdabiya . 
The Libyan Red Crescent says another 5,000 are displaced in the coastal town of Derna . 
The United Nations refugee agency says it has sent two medical convoys to Benghazi and also shipments of blankets , sleeping mats and other basic items . 
But delivering aid is an issue . 
The agency does not have access to places other than Benghazi , the nation 's second-largest city that is in the hands of the opposition . 
Reports like these are not uncommon in war . 
For its victims , life 's only focus becomes survival . 
One man says Gadhafi 's tanks roared down Ajdabiya 's streets , firing into houses . 
What choice did they have but to flee ? 
He says the troops were searching house to house . 
They took away five young men from his neighbor 's place . 
He does n't know what happened to them or whether he will ever see them again .

2011-03-25,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Fri Mar 25 , 2011 7:42 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Western warplanes bombed Muammar Gaddafi 's tanks and artillery in eastern Libya on Friday to try to break a battlefield stalemate and help rebels take the strategic town of Ajdabiyah . 
Rebels said they had entered Ajdabiyah from the east , Al Jazeera reported , while Gaddafi 's forces held on in the west of the town , which commands the coastal road toward Tripoli . 
The African Union said it was planning to facilitate talks to help end the war , but NATO said its operation could last three months , and France said the conflict would not end soon . 
In Washington , a U.S. military spokeswoman said the coalition fired 16 Tomahawk cruise missiles and flew 153 air sorties in the past 24 hours targeting Gaddafi 's artillery , mechanized forces and command and control infrastructure . 
Western governments hope the raids , launched on Saturday with the aim of protecting civilians , will shift the balance of power in favor of the Arab world 's most violent popular revolt . 
In Tripoli , residents reported another air raid just before dawn , hearing the roar of a warplane , followed by a distant explosion and bursts of anti-aircraft gunfire . 
As the United States said Gaddafi 's ability to command and sustain his forces was diminishing , Libyan state TV said the `` brother leader '' had promoted all members of his armed forces and police `` for their heroic and courageous fight against the crusader , colonialist assault , '' without giving further details . 
Rebels massing for an attack on Ajdabiyah earlier exchanged artillery fire with Gaddafi 's forces . 
Opposition forces on the road there seemed more organized than in recent days , when their disarray stirred doubts about their ability to challenge Gaddafi . 
They had set up road blocks at regular intervals and Reuters counted at least four truck-based rocket launchers -- heavier weaponry than had been seen earlier this week . 
Winning back Ajdabiyah would be the biggest victory for the eastern rebels since Western military intervention halted a counter-offensive by the better equipped Gaddafi forces which had driven them back toward the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
It would also signal that allied airstrikes may be capable of helping rebel fighters eventually topple Gaddafi . 
At African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa , AU commission chairman Jean Ping said it was planning to facilitate peace talks in a process that should end with democratic elections . 
It was the first statement by the AU , which had rejected any form of foreign intervention in the Libya crisis , since the U.N. Security Council imposed a no-fly zone last week and air strikes began on Libyan military targets . 
But in Brussels , a NATO official said planning for NATO 's operation assumed a mission lasting 90 days , although this could be extended or shortened as required . 
France said the war could drag on for weeks . 
`` I doubt that it will be days , '' Admiral Edouard Guillaud , the head of French armed forces , told France Info radio . 
`` I think it will be weeks . 
I hope it will not take months . '' 
Guillaud said a French plane destroyed an army artillery battery near Ajdabiyah , while in London , the Ministry of Defense said British Tornado aircraft had also been active there . 
A Reuters correspondent who traveled close to Ajdabiyah during the day on Friday saw large plumes of black smoke rising above the eastern entrance to the town . 
A rocket apparently fired from rebel positions then hit the eastern gate , sending a fireball into the sky . 
`` The eastern gate has fallen and we are sending a team to check before moving forward , '' rebel Colonel Hamad al-Hasi told Reuters . 
In Benghazi , rebel spokesman Mustafa Gheriani said he expected Ajdabiyah to fall following the Western strikes . 
`` This -LRB- the strikes -RRB- will weaken their forces and more importantly their morale , '' he said , adding the level of Western strikes was `` sufficient . 
We feel safe under their protection . '' 
Simon Brooks , head of the International Committee of the Red Cross operations in eastern Libya , reported big population movements from the Ajdabiyah area because of the fighting . 
Officials and rebels said aid organizations were able to deliver some supplies to the western city of Misrata but were concerned because of government snipers in the city center . 
Gaddafi 's forces shelled an area on the outskirts of the city , killing six people including three children , a rebel said . 
Misrata has experienced some of the heaviest fighting between rebels and Gaddafi 's forces since an uprising began on February 16 . 
QATARI PLANE JOINS AIR PATROLS NATO said on Thursday after four days of tough negotiations that it would enforce the no-fly zone but stopped short of taking full command of U.N.-mandated military operations to protect civilians from forces loyal to Gaddafi . 
Differences over the scope the U.N. resolution gave for military action against Gaddafi 's army led to days of heated arguments within NATO about its role in the operation . 
The United States , embroiled in Iraq and Afghanistan , is keen to step back and play a supporting role in Libya in order to preserve alliance unity and maintain the support of Muslim countries for the U.N.-mandated intervention . 
Despite the apparently cumbersome structure of the planned new command and Arab jitters on the use of force , the operation continues to receive support from beyond Western ranks . 
The United Arab Emirates said it would send 12 planes to take part in operations to enforce the no-fly zone . 
Qatar has contributed two fighters and two military transport planes . 
A coalition task force statement said a Qatari Mirage 2000-5 jet joined a French air force plane over Libya on Friday , making it the first Arab country to begin patrolling . 
Some countries critical of the operation have suggested Western powers had exceeded the U.N. mandate , especially since they have said publicly they would like Gaddafi to go , and also expressed concerns about civilian deaths from air strikes . 
Libyan officials and hospital workers said civilians , including women , were among those killed in the latest Western air strikes in Tripoli . 
There was no way to independently verify the report . 
Security analysts have also warned against the risk of the West becoming embroiled in a lengthy civil war , effectively taking the said of a rebel movement they know little about . 
British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the West could not be certain of the outcome but told Reuters the risk was justified and that standing aside while Gaddafi 's forces killed civilians would have caused public outrage in Britain . 
`` No one should think that you can launch a mission like this and be absolutely 100 percent sure what is going to come of this , '' he said . 
`` There are risks . 
It is going to be untidy . 
There are going to be unintended consequences . 
People have got to accept there is always a degree of uncertainty in these kind of undertakings . ''

2011-03-26,"By the CNN Wire Staff Explosion in Tripoli ; plane heard `` Winds of change are starting to blow , '' opposition says Rebel forces took control of Ajdabiya overnight Ajdabiya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The retreat of Moammar Gadhafi 's forces from a key eastern city Saturday reinvigorated the opposition , which began taking the fight west toward the capital of Tripoli . 
By Saturday evening , advancing opposition fighters had reached the outskirts of the city of Brega , to the west of Ajdabiya , said opposition spokesman Col. Ahmed Omar Bani . 
`` The winds of change are starting to blow , '' Bani told reporters in Benghazi . 
Gadhafi 's troops fell back after days of fierce fighting in Ajdabiya , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . 
He said the coalition 's airstrike attacks were direct and the Libyan military decided to withdraw . 
That air campaign continued Saturday , further limiting loyalist movements . 
French warplanes destroyed at least five Libyan combat planes and two helicopters over a 24-hour period , the Ministry of Defense said . 
Rebels take back critical Libyan city Libya 's civil war making families homeless Meanwhile , an especially loud explosion and the subsequent sound of a plane , most likely belonging to the allies , were heard late Saturday in Tripoli , but there was no anti-aircraft fire in response . 
After the fall of Ajdabiya , the fighting is sure to shift westward through cities and towns that are more loyal to Gadhafi . 
Jalal al-Gallal , another spokesman , said the opposition expects heavy resistance in towns like Sirte , Gadhafi 's birthplace , where he has strong support . 
Gadhafi 's forces resumed shelling Misrata , just two hours east of Tripoli , where some of the most intense fighting has taken place since protests erupted in Libya last month . 
A witness told CNN that Gadhafi troops randomly targeted buildings and people in Misrata . 
Another witness said he saw busloads of loyalist snipers being brought to the city . 
CNN could not independently verify those accounts . 
Officials have said Gadhafi is far from defeated and still retains the power to reinforce units . 
Opposition fighters chanted gratitude for the coalition 's support after they wrested control of Ajdabiya , considered a gateway to Libya 's vast oil fields and a stopping point en route to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
They were confident that with protective air power they would be able to hold onto the city they had captured once before but lost to Gadhafi 's army . 
Ajdabiya is now `` 100 percent '' in opposition hands , said Shamsuldin Abed Mawlah , spokesman for Libya 's opposition interim council . 
He said many loyalists were retreating westward . 
Overnight , international fighter jets again bombed Libyan tanks that have been entrenched at the city 's northern and western gates for days , said al-Gallal . 
At the northern entrance , damaged tanks lay strewn across the rolling desert . 
The buildings around the city entrances were riddled with bullet holes . 
Rebel troops combed the city 's streets Saturday , hunting for any remaining Gadhafi loyalists as some displaced residents trickled back to their homes . 
The Ajdabiya victory is viewed as significant for the opposition . 
It also served as evidence of the impact of coalition airstrikes as NATO prepares to take command of the Libya mission this weekend . 
Coalition airstrikes targeted Gadhafi 's military on the outskirts of Misrata but tanks resumed shelling Saturday , a doctor at the main hospital told CNN . 
Opposition fighters , armed only with light weapons , were trying to repel the attack and casualties were mounting , he said . 
At least 20 people were wounded in Misrata , victims of snipers taking aim in the heart of the city , said the doctor , who was not identified for safety reasons . 
Friday , seven people were killed and another 70 were wounded . 
Al-Gallal said the next big battle will be for control of Misrata . 
`` He -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- is scared about Misrata , '' al-Gallal said . 
`` It 's too close to Tripoli . 
He 's going to do everything he can to hold on to it . '' 
Opposition leaders uploaded a video that showed a rooftop view of Misrata . 
Gunfire could be heard and puffs of smoke rose from at least one rooftop , possibly indicating a sniper . 
CNN could not verify the contents of the video . 
Coalition planes flew 164 sorties Friday in Operation Odyssey Dawn and coalition leaders reported damage to Gadhafi 's ground forces . 
`` Coalition forces have targeted anti-air capabilities , tanks , armored vehicles , as well as other regime forces threatening the civilians throughout the country , '' said Capt. Clint Gebke , a coalition spokesman . 
U.S. President Barack Obama defended America 's leadership in the international coalition in his weekly radio address Saturday . 
`` Make no mistake , '' Obama said , `` because we acted quickly , a humanitarian catastrophe has been avoided and the lives of countless civilians -- innocent men , women and children -- have been saved . '' 
`` The United States should not -- and can not -- intervene every time there 's a crisis somewhere in the world , '' Obama said . 
`` But I firmly believe that when innocent people are being brutalized ; when someone like Gadhafi threatens a bloodbath that could destabilize an entire region ; and when the international community is prepared to come together to save many thousands of lives -- then it 's in our national interest to act . 
And it 's our responsibility . 
This is one of those times . '' 
Obama is scheduled to deliver a televised address on Libya Monday evening . 
Libyan government spokesman Ibrahim Mussa slammed the coalition attacks . 
`` This is immoral , illegal and it was not authorized by the -LRB- United Nations -RRB- Security Council , '' he told reporters in Tripoli . 
Libyan state television reported Saturday that `` airstrikes from the enemy '' had hit military positions in Tarhunah , about 40 miles -LRB- 66 kilometers -RRB- from the country 's capital . 
Pentagon spokesman Capt. Darryn James told CNN Saturday that airstrikes had struck military targets along the Libyan coast , including those in the capital .

2011-03-26,"By the CNN Wire Staff Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her Libyan woman shows journalists staying at the hotel her bruises She says she was held against her will and raped by 15 men Security men try to shut her up and manhandle journalists Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Breakfast at a Tripoli hotel housing international journalists took a decidedly grim turn Saturday when a desperate Libyan woman burst into the building frantic to let the world know she had been raped and beaten by Moammar Gadhafi 's militia . 
Her face was heavily bruised . 
So were her legs . 
She displayed blood on her right inner thigh . 
She said her name was Eman al-Obeidy . 
She was well-dressed and appeared to be a well-to-do middle-aged woman . 
She spoke in English and said she was from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and had been picked up by Gadhafi 's men at a checkpoint east of Tripoli . 
She sobbed and said she was held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . 
`` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . 
`` My honor was violated by them . '' 
She showed the journalists how she had been tied at her wrists and ankles . 
She had visible rope burns . 
`` We are all Libyans , '' the woman said . 
`` Why do n't you treat us the same ? '' 
Libyan dragged away after rape claim Rebels take back critical Libyan city CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story but her injuries appeared consistent with what she said . 
Government officials quickly closed in to stifle her . 
But she persisted , wanting the journalists , staying at the Rixos Hotel , to see Gadhafi 's brutality firsthand . 
International journalists , including CNN 's staff , are not allowed to move freely in the Libyan capital and are escorted out of the hotel only on organized outings by government minders . 
This was the first time a Libyan opposed to Gadhafi attempted to independently approach the journalists here . 
What followed was a disturbing scene of how Gadhafi 's government operates . 
Security forces moved to subdue the woman . 
Even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . 
he shouted at her in contempt . 
Another staffer tried to put a dark tablecloth over her head . 
One government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt . 
Others scuffled with the journalists , manhandling them to the ground in an attempt to wrestle away their equipment . 
Some journalists were beaten and kicked . 
CNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair . 
Security men said al-Obeidy was `` mentally ill '' and was being taken to a `` hospital . '' 
They dragged her unceremoniously to a waiting white car . 
`` If you do n't see me tomorrow , than that 's it , '' she yelled . 
The journalists believed al-Obeidy 's life to be in danger , and several of them demanded to see her . 
At a news conference later , they challenged Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim on what they had experienced . 
Kaim told them that authorities were investigating the incident . 
`` We will let you know , '' he said . 
Later , a government spokesman said al-Obeidy was `` safe '' and `` doing well . '' 
He said her case was a criminal one -- not political -- and that she has been offered legal aid . 
Officials later said the woman was sane and would bring criminal charges against her attackers . 
Journalists would be able to see her , they added . 
But his assurances did little to assure the journalists who had witnessed Gadhafi 's firm and pervasive grip on Libyan society . 
A woman who dared to speak against him was quickly silenced . 
Journalists who dared to tell her story paid a price . 
It was one tale that perhaps went a long way in illuminating the need to protect Libya 's people .

2011-03-27,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libya responds to rape claim The matter is `` a criminal case , '' says government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim Eman al-Obeidy is at home with her family , he says `` She ... entered a place she was n't supposed to enter '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Libyan woman who stormed into a Tripoli hotel Saturday , telling foreign reporters that she had been raped by government troops , has been released , and her case is being investigated , government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Sunday . 
The matter is `` a criminal case against four individuals '' who have an attorney , he said . 
Among those accused by Eman al-Obeidy is the son of a high-ranking official , he said . 
The general attorney is looking into the case . 
The woman `` has n't committed , you know , any particular major offense , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` She just entered a place she was n't supposed to enter . '' 
He said al-Obeidy and her family have been asked if they want to be interviewed by `` one or two , preferably female , reporters to verify that she 's fine , she 's healthy , she 's free with her family . '' 
Benghazi rally supports Libyan woman Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her But Ibrahim refused to take further questions on the issue Sunday , noting that Libyan society is `` very conservative . '' 
CNN 's Nic Robertson , who has been on the ground in Tripoli since February 27 , cautioned against taking Ibrahim 's statements as fact , noting that `` oftentimes what he says does n't match reality . '' 
`` We 've been told by the government that she 's with her family , but when we asked , ` Could we go and see them ? ' 
the government official said that would be up to the family , '' Robertson said , adding that journalists have indeed been in touch with the family , who have said they would grant permission to see al-Obeidy . 
However , international journalists , including CNN 's staff , are not allowed to move freely in the Libyan capital and are escorted out of the hotel only on organized outings by government minders . 
Saturday 's incident was the first time a Libyan opposed to Gadhafi attempted to independently approach the journalists in Tripoli . 
Robertson also tried to ask Ibrahim about statements the spokesman made referring to al-Obeidy as a prostitute , but he declined to answer the question while saying , `` I 'm not withdrawing from what I said . '' 
`` We need to protect her privacy , her daughter 's rights when she grows up , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` We need to make this as criminal case , as legal a case as possible without talking about people 's history , their files , their previous crimes or their lifestyle . '' 
Wedad Omar , the woman 's cousin , told CNN that the 30-year-old al-Obeidy is single and does not have a daughter . 
Al-Obeidy burst into the hotel Saturday as international journalists were having breakfast . 
Her face was bruised , as were her legs . 
She showed the journalists blood on her right inner thigh .

2011-03-27,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan rebels claim key gains Coalition airstrikes continue as NATO agrees to take command of the Libya mission Rebel fighters appear to have control of Ras Lanuf and Brega A government spokesman says NATO is `` starving the Libyan population '' Eight people are killed and 22 injured in Misrata , an eyewitness says Ras Lanuf , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan opposition fighters marched west Sunday , seizing control of two key cities , CNN observed , and gaining ground as coalition airstrikes continued to pound the North African nation . 
Rebel forces told CNN that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi pulled back from Ras Lanuf . 
A CNN crew in the city witnessed damaged vehicles on the outskirts of the town , though the town appeared to have avoided major destruction . 
There were some homes that appeared burned , and others had gaping holes . 
The damage looked to be from fighting when Gadhafi 's forces had originally pushed the rebels out . 
There were no clashes reported Sunday , rebels said . 
Rebels also appeared to have taken control of the key oil town of Brega , a CNN team on the scene observed . 
Some opposition fighters focused on securing Brega 's entrance while others traveled in trucks heading west , encountering little resistance along the way . 
NATO takes over Libya mission The gains signify that the rebel forces have reclaimed all the territory they lost to Gadhafi 's forces at the start of the war . 
The opposition comeback was paved in part by coalition airstrikes designed to stop the killings of civilians , and that have hit Gadhafi 's forces . 
Coalition airstrikes continued Sunday as NATO approved an operations plan that will shift the entire Libyan military mission to alliance command , officials said . 
The new NATO mandate will begin in two to three days , NATO officials said , allowing the current coalition , led by the United States , the United Kingdom and France , to stand down . 
Coalition officials say the airstrikes are aimed at enforcing a no-fly zone and protecting civilians in Libya . 
But Libyan government officials have countered that claim , arguing that coalition forces only target troops loyal to Gadhafi . 
`` The rebels are making their advance and no one is stopping them . 
And no one is even talking to them or saying , ` Where are you going ? ' 
or ` Why are you taking offensive positions and attacking the Libyan army and Libyan cities ? ' '' 
Moussa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , told reporters in Tripoli . 
He accused NATO of `` starving the Libyan population to get Libya on its knees to beg for mercy . '' 
`` They are trying to weaken our spirits . 
They are not trying to protect civilians , '' he said . 
Ibrahim added that 29 people were injured Sunday when a `` peace convoy '' came under attack by `` armed militias . '' 
No one was killed , he said . 
While the opposition rolled westward , the city of Misrata -- located between the rebels ' current position and Tripoli -- remained under siege by government forces for the 11th consecutive day , an eyewitness told CNN . 
The city remained under shelling and pro-Gadhafi snipers remained on rooftops , he said . 
Pro-Gadhafi forces appeared to be shelling strategic places like the port and a main industrial area , he said . 
Busloads of soldiers have arrived in the city dressed as civilians , the witness said . 
The soldiers ostensibly came to participate in a peace march , but it appeared to be a ploy to set up positions around the city , he said . 
Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her Libya responds to rape claim `` The snipers are firing into the main streets and into the back streets . 
There are also tanks , '' he said . 
According to him , 116 civilians have been killed in the last week . 
A doctor in Misrata working at a hospital said eight civilians were killed and 22 injured in the violence Sunday . 
CNN could not immediately confirm his report independently . 
French warplanes on Sunday led airstrikes on armored vehicles and on a large ammunitions depot in the regions of Misrata and Zintan , according to the French Ministry of Defense . 
After Ras Lanuf , the next major city on the highway toward the capital of Tripoli is Gadhafi 's hometown of Sirte . 
Rebel forces told CNN they expect a long and bloody battle there . 
In Tripoli on Sunday , CNN 's Nic Robertson reported he heard six loud explosions and saw heavy anti-aircraft tracer fire . 
The CNN team there heard at least four explosions early Monday , followed again by anti-aircraft fire . 
Meanwhile , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that Gadhafi is placing the bodies of people his regime has killed at the sites of some missile strikes by the U.S.-led coalition , according to intelligence . 
In an interview broadcast Sunday on the CBS program `` Face the Nation , '' Gates said he was unaware of coalition attacks causing civilian casualties . 
`` The truthof the matter is we have trouble coming up with proof of any civilian casualties that we have been responsible for , '' Gates said in the interview conducted Saturday . 
`` But we do have a lot of intelligence reporting about Gadhafi taking the bodies of the people he 's killed and putting them at the sites where we 've attacked . '' 
Asked how often it has happened , Gates replied : `` We have a number of reports of that . '' 
Determined to topple Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year reign , rebels have said they will continue the westward march to Tripoli . 
`` The dictator has chosen to take the bloody road . 
... We encourage him to leave or we will force his removal , '' opposition spokesman Col. Ahmed Omar Bani told reporters Saturday . 
State television reported that civilian and military locations in Sabha and Gadhafi 's birthplace of Sirte were bombed overnight . 
Coalition planes flew at least 96 airstrike missions in a 24-hour period that ended Saturday , according to statistics released by the Pentagon , and leaders reported damage to Gadhafi 's ground forces . 
Opposition fighters chanted gratitude for the coalition 's support Saturday after they wrested control of Ajdabiya , considered a gateway to Libya 's vast oil fields and a stopping point en route to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
The coalition 's air campaign continued Saturday , further limiting loyalist movements . 
French warplanes destroyed at least five Libyan combat planes and two helicopters over a 24-hour period , the Ministry of Defense said . 
Explosions and airstrikes were also reported in Tripoli , Tarhunah and Misrata .

NATO agrees to take on all Libya operations Transition to happen in two to three days The United States will get the transition it has been pushing for NATO to take over no-fly zone by Monday Brussels , Belgium -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO 's North Atlantic Council on Sunday approved an operations plan that will shift the entire Libyan military mission to alliance command , officials said , easing the burden on the United States and its allies to protect civilians in the war-torn country . 
NATO ambassadors unanimously approved a so-called `` no-fly plus '' plan that will put the alliance in charge of protecting civilians as well as enforcing a no-fly zone and an arms embargo . 
`` Our goal is to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack from the Gadhafi regime , '' NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said . 
`` NATO will implement all aspects of the U.N. resolution . 
Nothing more , nothing less . '' 
The new NATO mandate will begin in two to three days , NATO officials said , allowing the current coalition , led by the United States , the United Kingdom and France , to stand down . 
NATO 's role in Libya unclear Libyan rebels claim key gains US Libya mission : Fly-over with no end ? 
At the same time , NATO was putting the final touches on its takeover of the no-fly zone over Libya . 
The handover from the United States and allies should be complete by Monday . 
NATO officials described the transition as a phased and seamless operation . 
All alliance members will have to abide by the rules of engagement approved Sunday , albeit with caveats that may allow some nations not to participate in operations in Libya . 
However , it is assumed that none of these nations will prevent other alliance members from executing the military plan and rules of engagement that were approved . 
A senior U.S. administration official spoke to reporters soon after the announcement . 
He stressed the NATO mission is to protect civilians and did not rule out the possibility of an attack on the rebels if they were to go on the offensive and strike cities with civilian populations , now held by pro-Gadhafi forces . 
The official also said he expected more countries to participate in the Libyan mission now that NATO has assumed command of it . 
He praised the speed with which the group of 28 allies reached a consensus . 
The office of British Prime Minister David Cameron similarly cheered the news of a NATO agreement . 
`` NATO is already enforcing the arms embargo and the no-fly zone . 
Today 's agreement to transfer complete command and control of all military operations to NATO both ensures that partners from the region are able to participate and represents a significant step forward as we plan for the next phase of this vital mission , '' it read .

CNN journalist sees woman burst into hotel saying Gadhafi supporters raped , beat her Khalil Abdallah understood her cries in Arabic : `` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me ! '' 
Abdallah says government minders violently blocked journalists , broke his camera Abdallah saw one minder with a gun in his hand , so the photojournalist backed away Editor 's note : CNN photojournalist Khalil Abdallah recounted his experience to CNN.com writer Ashley Fantz for this story . 
Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- CNN photojournalist Khalil Abdallah was having breakfast Saturday in a Tripoli hotel that houses foreign press when a woman burst into the restaurant , screaming that she had been raped and beaten for days by Moammar Gadhafi 's brigades . 
Her sudden entrance startled the group of international journalists , who were about to begin another day covering the crisis in Libya . 
The woman 's face was heavily bruised , a long bruise running down the left side of her cheek . 
She walked around , sobbing , shouting , lifting her dress to show a bloody thigh . 
Her ankles and wrists were bloody where she said she had been bound . 
One of the few present who spoke Arabic , the photojournalist understood her pleas . 
`` She was saying , ` We are all Libyans ! 
Why do n't you treat us the same ? ' '' 
Abdallah recounted Sunday for CNN.com . 
The woman told the journalists that she had been picked up at a government checkpoint east of Tripoli , tied , beaten and raped for two days . 
Her name was Eman al-Obeidy , she said . 
Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her Reporters gathered around her , trying to calm her , Abdallah recalled . 
He and other photojournalists dashed for their cameras . 
`` We were all in shock , '' Abdallah said , trying to keep a steady hand . 
He knew that minders -- the men Libya 's government assigns to foreign journalists to monitor their every move -- were nearby . 
Reporters had barely asked a few questions before those minders were on them , pushing and shoving reporters to the side , trying to jerk the woman away . 
Some of them were wearing their distinctive red badges , Abdallah said , while others were in plain clothes . 
Journalists tried to defend themselves and keep the woman away from the minders . 
`` It was like a rugby pileup , '' Abdallah said . 
A correspondent for Britain 's Channel 4 , Jonathan Miller , tried to push one of the minders back . 
The woman was trying to fight back as well , Abdallah said . 
`` She is pushing him -LRB- a minder -RRB- back saying , ` Do n't touch me , leave me alone ! ' '' 
`` From that point on , everybody in this hotel was against us -LRB- the journalists -RRB- , '' the photojournalist recounted . 
Minders ran after journalists , jumping on them , beating them , he said . 
At one point a bag was placed over the woman 's head and she was led out to the hotel garden . 
She was questioned for about 40 minutes , and then minders came back inside . 
They announced that the woman was crazy and that she was being taken to the hospital . 
`` All the minders were telling us she was drunk or had mental problems , '' Abdallah said . 
A short while later , the woman was led through the lobby . 
Journalists followed , protesting , shouting for the men to let her go . 
A journalist can be heard on video asking her : `` Are you OK ? '' 
`` No , '' the woman answers , her voice shaky . 
She yells into a camera : `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it ! '' 
The woman is forced into a waiting car . 
She shouts that she is being taken to jail . 
The minders told reporters that they could see the woman again , later . 
`` We have been told that we 'd see people again , but we never do , '' said Abdallah . 
An image he captured shows a minder pointing his finger at Abdallah just before snatching his camera and breaking it . 
`` He ripped the microphone off , the viewfinder , his nails sunk into my arm , '' said Abdallah . 
`` I was pulling the camera one way ; he was pulling it the other way . '' 
While wrestling for his camera , Abdallah saw a minder standing nearby holding a 9 mm handgun . 
The photojournalist let go and slowly began to back out of the restaurant . 
Then Abdallah heard something from the minders that he has come to expect , but that never fails to sting him . '' 
` He is Arab ! ' 
` Why is he doing this to us ? ' '' 
`` Once you 're labeled like that , it does n't matter what your citizenship is , '' he said . 
`` But what I felt more was terrible for this woman and how the government is going to deal with her . 
`` That is the thing that is most disturbing . '' 
The Libyan woman who stormed into the Tripoli hotel Saturday to tell foreign reporters that government troops raped her has been released , government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim told reporters at a news conference Sunday . 
CNN has not been able to independently confirm the spokesman 's announcement .

2011-03-28,"By the CNN Wire Staff Eman al-Obeidy burst into a hotel Saturday , saying she had been raped for two days by Moammar Gadhafi 's brigades . 
The Libyan government says Eman al-Obeidy was released Woman 's family says they were offered money to convince her to change her story The woman is a lawyer , parents say ; government called her mentally ill Al-Obeidy was kidnapped by Gadhafi forces , father says -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The mother of a woman who burst into a Tripoli hotel to tell journalists that she had been beaten and raped by troops loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said Monday that her daughter is still being held . 
Her claim contradicts an earlier statement from the government , which has said that Eman al-Obeidy was released and is at home with her family . 
`` Yesterday , late at night at 3 a.m. , they called me from Bab al Aziziya , '' Gadhafi 's compound in Tripoli , al-Obeidy 's mother told Al-Jazeera television Monday . 
`` And they told me : Make your daughter Eman change her statement ... and we will release her immediately and whatever you ask for you will get , whether money , or a new apartment , or guaranteeing financial security for you and your children . 
But just tell Eman to change her statement . '' 
A government spokesman said Sunday that al-Obeidy had been released and was with her family . 
Spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said then that al-Obeidy and her family were asked if they wanted to be interviewed by `` one or two , preferably female , reporters to verify that she 's fine , she 's healthy , she 's free with her family . '' 
He refused to take further questions on the issue , repeatedly stating that Libyan society is `` very conservative . '' 
Marriage for woman allegedly raped Cousin : ` She did n't look like herself ' A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach Al-Obeidy 's sister 's house Monday , but were blocked by security forces . 
The sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN , and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel . 
The family of al-Obeidy said she is a lawyer -- and not a prostitute or mentally ill as Libyan government officials initially said after the incident . 
The government has since changed its story , saying she is sane and pursuing a criminal case . 
Al-Obeidy 's father told Al-Jazeera that his daughter `` has her full mental capabilities and she is a graduate of law school and a lawyer and she is pursuing higher education in Tripoli . 
And she was kidnapped by Gadhafi 's tyrannical forces . '' 
`` I am not ashamed of my daughter , '' al-Obeidy 's mother , who spoke from an undisclosed location in Libya , told the network . 
`` I am proud of her because she has broken the barrier . 
She broke the barrier that no man can break . 
And those dogs there with him , Moammar , -LRB- are -RRB- the criminals ! '' 
She urged the youth of Libya to take action . 
Al-Obeidy burst into a Tripoli hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning . 
Her face was bruised , as were her legs . 
She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh . 
Speaking in English , she said she was from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . 
Though her injuries appeared consistent with what she said , CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story . 
`` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . 
`` My honor was violated by them . '' 
Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles . 
Government officials tried to stifle her , but she persisted . 
Security forces moved to subdue her , and even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . 
Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head . 
One government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt . 
Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment . 
Some journalists were beaten and kicked . 
CNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair . 
As security forces subdued the screaming woman and dragged her away , al-Obeidy warned , `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it . ''

2011-03-28,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : Bill Richardson : Obama explained the purpose -- to avert a humanitarian disaster Sen. John McCain : Obama saying regime change wo n't be pursued militarily is `` puzzling '' CNN 's Fareed Zakaria : `` Important '' speech explains U.S. military response is limited Rudolph Giuliani : `` The president 's speech tonight has made things even murkier '' -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a televised address Monday night , U.S. President Barack Obama explained the reasons he involved the U.S. military in the U.N.-authorized mission in Libya , saying `` it was not in our national interest '' to let the citizens of a rebel stronghold suffer a massacre at the hands of approaching pro-government forces . 
Obama also said that NATO would take full control of the military mission on Wednesday . 
Following is a collection of reactions from people including U.S. politicians and political analysts . 
U.S. Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona : `` I think that the first part of his speech was excellent , and he laid out the reasons why it was important to intervene and what would have happened in Benghazi . 
... He made a strong case . '' 
`` Then ... he made a very puzzling comment , and that was -LRB- regime change by force -RRB- would be a mistake . 
Gadhafi must have been comforted by that . '' 
`` The president 's policy is Gadhafi must go . 
I think there 's a chance , if we keep the pressure on , Gadhafi could be thrown under the bus -LRB- by people surrounding him . -RRB- '' 
`` It 's clear we 're on the side of the rebels in this conflict . 
... -LRB- But -RRB- if we tell Gadhafi , ` Do n't worry , you 're not going to be removed by force , ' I think that 's very encouraging for Gadhafi . '' 
Fareed Zakaria , host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' : `` It was actually an important speech . 
It was quite carefully constructed . 
It had a humanitarian angle , a strategic angle . 
But at the heart of what Obama is saying is that there are places in the world where the United States does not have vital national interests , where we have not been attacked , but we have limited interests and we 're going to try to find a way to have some kind of limited military response . '' 
`` What John McCain was suggesting -LRB- in the reaction above -RRB- frankly strikes me as a very dangerous argument -- that in a place where we have clearly limited interests , clearly nonvital interests , the United States and the president should -LRB- have -RRB- an open-ended policy of military escalation and say we will do whatever it takes to get Moammar Gadhafi out of office . 
That is , frankly , the way we got in conflicts like Vietnam . 
In order to not be humiliated , we could n't back down . '' 
Michael Steel , spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio : `` The speech failed to provide Americans much clarity to our involvement in Libya . 
Nine days into this military intervention , Americans still have no answer to the fundamental question : What does success in Libya look like ? '' 
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina : `` I thought he did a good job talking about the signal we would send , that we are a values-based people , and stranding by these young people in Libya will serve us well in the future . 
But the line that really sort of broke my heart was that regime change by force would be a mistake . 
The goal of this country is to replace Gadhafi . 
If you look at the balance sheet of what it costs this nation with Gadhafi versus what it costs without him , it is in our interest to get rid of him , and the opposition needs continued military support -- not a ground invasion by the U.S. or any other Western power , but air support -- all the way to Tripoli . '' 
`` If we continue the model we have in place ... -LRB- the rebels -RRB- will win . 
If we back off , this thing is going to go on for a long time , and a lot of people will die unnecessarily . '' 
Ali Suleiman Aujali , former Libyan ambassador to the United States : `` I think it is a great speech . 
The president was very clear and very determined , and defended his position in a nice way , and I think he convinced the American people . '' 
`` The Americans , they proved to the world they will not only intervene if there -LRB- are -RRB- American interests only , but ... also when human life is in danger . 
This is a historical decision . 
... We really appreciate what America did for the Libyan people . 
The Libyan people ... deserve a better government . '' 
Rudolph Giuliani , former New York City mayor : `` The president 's speech tonight has made things even murkier than they were before . 
The whole purpose of this was to clarify our mission . 
Our mission is just internally contradictory . 
The president says our mission is to protect the people of Libya . 
Well , how do you protect the people of Libya and not be for regime change in Libya ? 
Is n't the danger to the people of Libya Gadhafi ? '' 
`` The president 's speech is illogical . 
If you were grading this on a Greek logic exam , you 'd give it an F. The speech contradicts itself . 
It says limited action ; we 're not going to go any further than just protecting the people of Libya ; we 're not going to be for regime change . 
But you ca n't protect the people of Libya without regime change . 
Why are we there in the first place ? 
Because Gadhafi was slaughtering his people . 
How can you leave him there ? '' 
P.J. Crowley , former U.S. State Department spokesman : `` The president 's policy is to assist in the removal of Moammar Gadhafi . 
The issue is not with the policy . 
The issue is the mechanism . 
We 're acting in a limited manner to level the playing field so the Libyan people themselves and the opposition that has formed , they 'll do that job . 
It 's not for the United States to impose that from the outside . '' 
Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson : `` I felt the president was very presidential tonight . 
He explained the purpose : To avert a humanitarian disaster , to protect civilian lives . 
He even added ... a -LRB- potential -RRB- refugee crisis going to Tunisia and Egypt . '' 
`` I was very satisfied with his speech tonight . 
Again , consultation with Congress in the days ahead is going to be very important . 
But he explained the objective , and he explained what he wants to do , and the airstrikes have succeeded . 
Air defenses of Libya have been almost destroyed . 
The rebels are gaining momentum . 
Look , they 're probably not perfect revolutionary characters , but they 're sure as heck a lot better than Gadhafi staying . 
... I applaud the president tonight . '' 
Fouad Ajami , professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University : `` I think it 's the right thing at last . 
I think the president did a great job . 
I 'm not a fan of President Obama ; I did n't vote for him . 
I think he should have done this much earlier . 
But ... he finally did it . 
And I think he answered the great questions about this intervention . 
... And he told us the truth : This was always about Benghazi . 
It was about a rescue operation that he was forced to do , and I think it 's the right thing . '' 
Anne-Marie Slaughter , professor of international affairs at Princeton University : `` I think -LRB- Obama -RRB- ... made clear that we went in to avoid what he described as violence on a horrific scale in Benghazi ; that the mandate of the U.N. coalition ... is to protect Libyan civilians . 
I think that makes very clear what success looks like there . 
It means that Libyan civilians are safe -- safe in their houses , safe in their cities . 
At the same time , he made very clear that in his U.S. policy -- and the policy of many of our allies -- that Libya needs to have a new government that responds to the demands of the Libyan people , and that we will pursue every diplomatic and economic means to that end . 
And leveling the playing field militarily will certainly help . '' 
David Gergen , CNN senior political analyst : `` I thought in general -LRB- Obama -RRB- made a compelling case -- a very strong case for intervention itself on humanitarian grounds . 
He made a compelling case that the United States has helped to organize the international coalition much more rapidly than has happened in the past , as in Bosnia . 
And furthermore , I think he made a compelling case that these early U.S. actions really have accomplished what the United States promised to do , and that was to stop Gadhafi from killing other people . 
`` But ... the success of the speech ended there , because he left open all these questions about where we go from here if there 's a stalemate -- and there were signs today that there may be a stalemate . 
What are we going to do ? 
What is NATO going to do ? 
I do n't think anybody knows that . 
What is going to happen if Gadhafi hangs in there for six months ? 
What do we do then ? 
What happens if Gadhafi gets forced out ? 
What happens if the regime cracks and they turn on him -- even assassinate him ? 
What 's the United States ' role going to be in building a new Libya ? 
It thought that was left cloudy , and is going to continue the debate . 
`` But give President Obama his due . 
On the most important issue that he had to face tonight -- why he went in -- I thought he made a very , very strong case . '' 
Ari Fleischer , White House press secretary under President George W. Bush `` The tricky think here is , when you have a president who does the right thing , but who does it four weeks too late , can you really say it is the right thing ? 
This is really something that should have been done four weeks ago , when it was really likely that the rebels , by virtue of ... a multilateral action , could have tipped the scales and made Gadhafi think ... he needs to get out of there . 
I have a hard time seeing that happen now . 
I think it 's a fight to the finish , and this finish ends up in a stalemate . ''

NEW : NATO is expected to control no-fly zone by end of the day Monday NATO 's secretary general says NATO 's goal is to protect civilians `` We are not in Libya to arm people , but to protect people , '' he said NATO is taking the lead in enforcing the U.N. resolution Tune in to CNN tonight at 7 ET for live coverage of President Obama 's speech on Libya . 
Then at 8 and 9 p.m. , get expert analysis on '' In the Arena '' and '' Piers Morgan Tonight '' -- only on CNN . 
Brussels , Belgium -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO 's secretary general ruled out arming Libyan rebels Monday as the alliance continued to take over command and control of the entire Libyan mission . 
The first NATO sorties to maintain the no-fly zone over Libya flew on Sunday , NATO officials said . 
The alliance is expected to be in complete command of the no-fly zone by the end of the day Monday . 
The mission of protecting civilians is expected to be under full NATO control by the end of the week , they said . 
By taking control of the full mission , NATO will allow the United States to step out of its lead role and more into a supporting one as requested by the Obama administration . 
In an interview with CNN here at NATO headquarters , Anders Fogh Rasmussen said , `` The U.N. mandate authorizes the enforcement of an arms embargo , '' and that NATO has decided to participate . 
`` We are not in Libya to arm people , but to protect people , '' he said . 
NATO takes over Libya mission Libyan rebels continue westward push Obama to speak on Libya Monday What does Obama need to say Monday ? 
The ambiguity of the U.N. Security Council Resolution about Libya has made for a wide range of opinion among nations about exactly the kind of intervention that is permitted in order to `` protect civilians . '' 
In an interview Sunday , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates would not rule out the possibility of arming the rebels . 
`` No decision has been made about that at this point . 
The Security Council resolution would permit it . 
The second resolution , 1973 , would permit it . 
But no decisions have been made by our government about it , '' Gates told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' 
Some NATO sources acknowledged to CNN that they expect the scope of the rules of engagement to be more narrow than the coalition 's thus far , but they caution that as the situation on the ground changes , so too will the character of the NATO mission . 
`` Our mandate is very clear : We are there to protect civilians against attacks , no more , no less , and that will be our focus , '' Rasmussen said . 
He was unwilling to further characterize the nature of the rules of engagement . 
`` I will leave it to the military commanders to take decisions in concrete operations . 
We have decided in the NATO council on the overall political framework in full accordance with the U.N. mandate , and that is to protect civilians . 
And then we will leave it to the commanders to take daily decisions . '' 
The rules of engagement and the use of force to protect civilians have been contentious issues as NATO sought consensus to take over the Libyan mission . 
Turkey and Germany were among a handful of alliance members that want a more strict interpretation of the U.N. mandate . 
France , in particular , had been seeking more latitude to further embolden the rebels to topple Moammar Gadhafi . 
Rasmussen ruled out the possibility of any NATO member country carrying out a parallel campaign in Libya , including France . 
`` No , NATO is about solidarity , and the fact that NATO takes over the operation means that we have a unity of command '' he said .

In mid-January , autocratic Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country and an interim government took over . 
The success of the Tunisian protests in prompting regime change soon spurred similar protests across North Africa and the Middle East . 
Here is what 's happening today : -LRB- 11:39 p.m. Monday ET , 5:39 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- Fareed Zakaria , host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS , '' reacts to U.S. President Barack Obama 's televised address on Libya : -LRB- 11:28 p.m. Monday ET , 5:28 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's youngest son , who runs the country 's elite special forces for his father 's regime , was on an internship program in the United States when public unrest exploded in Libya last month , CNN 's Pam Benson reports . 
Khamis Gadhafi abruptly cut off his visit and returned to Libya , where he has led the 32nd Reinforced Brigade , known at the Khamis Brigade , in its suppression of rebel forces . 
ABC News was the first to report Khamis ' recent stay in the U.S. . 
The brigade 's headquarters was the target of six Tomahawk missiles overnight , according to Vice Adm. William Gortney of the Joint Staff . 
Libya 's state TV on Monday night broadcast live footage from Gadhafi 's Tripoli compound of Khamis dressed in uniform and greeting people . 
Prior to the broadcast there had been unconfirmed reports that the younger Gadhafi had died from injuries he suffered when a plane flown by a disgruntled Libyan pilot crashed into a military compound while he was there . 
-LRB- 7:55 p.m. Monday ET , 1:55 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- The world had a `` unique ability to stop '' violence `` on a horrific scale '' in Libya by acting in a broad coalition with the support of Arab countries , U.S. President Barack Obama said in his televised address on Libya . 
`` I am convinced that a failure to act in Libya would have carried a far greater price for America , '' he said . 
He also said that while there is no question that Libya would be better off without Moammar Gadhafi as leader , the United States will actively pursue his ouster through non-military means . 
But broadening the military mission `` to include regime change would be a mistake , '' Obama said . 
The transition to a `` legitimate government '' in Libya is `` a task for the international community , and more importantly , a task for the Libyan people themselves , '' Obama said , adding : `` If we tried to overthrow Gadhafi by force , our coalition would splinter . '' 
-LRB- 7:38 p.m. Monday ET , 1:38 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- - U.S. President Barack Obama , addressing the Libyan situation in a televised speech , said he ordered U.S. warships into the Mediterranean off Libya because of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's `` brutal repression '' of his people and `` a looming humanitarian crisis . '' 
`` It was not in our national interest '' to let the citizens of Benghazi - a rebel stronghold on which pro-Gadhafi forces were advancing before coalition airstrikes - suffer a massacre at the hands of Gadhafi 's forces , Obama said . 
It would have `` stained the conscience of the world , '' he said . 
-LRB- 7:03 p.m. Monday ET , 1:03 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- Pro-Gadhafi forces say they have taken control of the entire western Libyan city of Misrata after days of fighting there , but rebels say they still control the center of the city . 
The Libyan government has escorted journalists , including CNN 's Nic Robertson , to Misrata , but not to the city 's center . 
In the video below , Robertson describes seeing signs of heavy fighting in Misrata , including `` mile after mile of damage '' and `` tanks hiding under trees at the side of the road . '' 
-LRB- 6:43 p.m. Monday ET , 12:43 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- Since the coalition military operation began more than a week ago , the United States ' `` unique capabilities '' have been referred to time and time again by U.S. officials , from President Barack Obama to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . 
CNN 's Jennifer Rizzo takes a look at those capabilities - military tools that other coalition and NATO countries do not , or do not have as much of , including surveillance and communication jamming capabilities . 
-LRB- 5:31 p.m. Monday ET , 11:31 p.m. in Libya -RRB- The U.S. military already has reduced its day-to-day presence in the coalition military operation above and around Libya , according to a defense official . 
`` Some of the ships have peeled off , but are still in the region , '' said the official , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the mission . 
At least two of the ships involved in the initial phase of establishing the no-fly zone over Libya - which began March 19 - are no longer involved in day-to-day operations , the official said . 
NATO is beginning to take command and control of the no-fly zone . 
However , it could take until Thursday or Friday for the organization to take over the entire mission mandated by a March 17 U.N. Security Council resolution . 
That resolution authorized the no-fly zone 's creation and the protection of civilians . 
-LRB- 4:37 p.m. Monday ET , 10:27 p.m. in Libya -RRB- U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at the Pentagon Monday that the United States is not working in direct support of opposition forces in Libya . 
`` We 're not coordinating with the opposition , '' he said , adding that any gain it makes is `` tenuous . '' 
Gortney 's comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov complained Monday that airstrikes by an international coalition including the United States seemed to expand beyond the scope of a U.N. resolution . 
That resolution , approved on March 17 , created a no-fly zone above Libya and mandates the protection of civilians . 
`` There are reports - which go undenied - that the air forces of the coalition conduct airstrikes on -LRB- Libyan leader Moammar -RRB- Gadhafi 's troops and support the military actions of rebels . 
There is an obvious controversy there , '' Lavrov told reporters in Moscow .

2011-03-28,"NEW : U.S. President Obama makes his case for intervention in Libya NEW : Diplomats prepare to meet in London Rebels enter Gadhafi loyalist territory , then flee gunfire , they say Libyan state television claims civilians are injured from Sabha bombing Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Opposition fighters continued to push west , entering territory loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , but were quickly beaten back , rebels told CNN , as diplomats arrived Tuesday in London to discuss the crisis . 
The setback for the rebels highlights the tenuous nature of their recent gains and suggests they might face more resistance in the days to come . 
As they moved into Umm el Ghindel -- near Sirte , Gadhafi 's birthplace -- rebels began searching homes and found that Gadhafi 's forces had armed residents in the area , they said . 
As they were talking to residents , asking them to join the opposition , gunfire broke out . 
Rebels told CNN they refused to fire back and began a hasty retreat . 
A stream of vehicles could be seen fleeing the area . 
CNN could not independently confirm details of the report . 
NATO takes over Libya mission Earlier , a wounded rebel with bandages on the left side of his head and face described what happened Monday about 30 kilometers -LRB- nearly 20 miles -RRB- from Sirte , near the city 's main entrance . 
He said he and a group of fellow opposition fighters came across a group of Gadhafi forces who raised a white flag -- a suggestion that they would not shoot . 
But as the opposition approached the group , Gadhafi forces fired on them indiscriminately , killing some of the opposition members and wounding others , the rebel told CNN 's Arwa Damon . 
Vehicles were destroyed as well , he said . 
Rebels credited coalition airstrikes with helping them regain ground , noting that they had encountered little resistance as they headed west over the weekend . 
But they said Monday that they need more airstrikes to advance further . 
Coalition officials say they are enforcing a U.N. Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that creates a no-fly zone above Libya and mandates the protection of civilians . 
Taking Sirte would be a symbolic victory for the rebels , who regained control of several significant towns over the weekend as coalition airstrikes continued . 
Rebels said the fight to take over Sirte could be their toughest and bloodiest battle yet . 
Opposition forces claimed to have gained control of the town of Ras Lanuf on Sunday . 
The opposition also appeared to have taken control of the key oil town of Brega . 
Those victories marked a comeback for the ragtag group of amateur soldiers who are unified by one mission : toppling Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
On Monday , opposition troops and Gadhafi 's security forces battled over the town of Nawfaliya . 
Rebel forces told CNN they had gained control of the city . 
CNN could hear explosions and see plumes of smoke in the area of Nawfaliyah and Sirte . 
In Misrata , where rebel fighters have said they have been under siege for weeks , CNN 's Nic Robertson saw evidence of heavy fighting and damage Monday when the government organized a trip for reporters to the city . 
Government forces said they were in control of Misrata , though they did not allow Robertson and others into the city center , which rebels have said they control . 
Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her Libya responds to rape claim Cousin : ` She did n't look like herself ' More than 40 foreign ministers , representatives from regional groups and top diplomats are expected to attend , including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , British Prime Minister David Cameron , Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . 
U.S. President Barack Obama delivered a speech about Libya Monday , making his case for military intervention amid tough calls for him to clarify the United States ' role in the U.N.-authorized military mission . 
He stressed the United States has a strategic interest in stopping the Libyan leader , and said `` history is not on Gadhafi 's side . '' 
Despite the pressure for more international action , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov complained Monday that the coalition 's actions seemed to expand beyond the U.N. resolution 's scope . 
`` There are reports -- which go undenied -- that the air forces of the coalition conduct airstrikes on Gadhafi 's troops and support the military actions of rebels . 
There is an obvious controversy there , '' he told reporters in Moscow . 
`` We believe that the interference into what is , essentially , an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution . '' 
Russia abstained from voting on the U.N. Security Council resolution but did not veto it . 
Libyan government officials have also argued that coalition forces target only troops loyal to Gadhafi . 
`` The rebels are making their advance and no one is stopping them . 
And no one is even talking to them or saying , ` Where are you going ? ' 
or ` Why are you taking offensive positions and attacking the Libyan army and Libyan cities ? ' '' 
Moussa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , told reporters in Tripoli Sunday . 
He accused NATO of `` starving the Libyan population to get Libya on its knees to beg for mercy . '' 
`` They are trying to weaken our spirits . 
They are not trying to protect civilians , '' he said . 
NATO , which has 28 member countries , formally approved plans Sunday to take control of enforcing the U.N. Security Council resolution . 
The coalition enforcing the resolution has been led by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . 
`` Our mandate is very clear . 
We 're there to protect civilians against attacks . 
No more , no less , '' NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN . 
Rasmussen said military commanders will make decisions on day-to-day operations within the framework NATO members agreed upon over the weekend . 
He declined to discuss specific rules of engagement , but stressed that NATO also is enforcing an arms embargo in Libya . 
`` We are not in Libya to arm people , but to protect people , '' he said . 
On Monday , Libyan state television displayed images of injured people in a hospital and destroyed buildings as it reported that civilians were wounded when bombs struck the central Libyan city of Sabha in the early morning hours . 
CNN was unable to independently verify that report . 
U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at the Pentagon Monday that there have been no confirmed civilian casualties in Libya as a result of coalition activity . 
Also Monday , video footage emerged online purporting to show forces loyal to Gadhafi abusing prisoners . 
CNN was not able to confirm the authenticity of the video or determine exactly when and where it was shot . 
In the clip , soldiers are seen taunting and slapping prisoners , who are crouched in the back of a truck with their hands bound . 
Qatar announced Monday that it would recognize the Transitional National Council , composed of opposition representatives , as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people .

2011-03-28,"Gadhafi : Libya 's flamboyant , mercurial ruler By Mike Pearson , For CNN Gadhafi seized control of Libya in the very place where the current tumult is strongest , the city of Benghazi . 
Moammar Gadhafi has ruled Libya for 42 years He took control in a bloodless coup with fellow military officers in 1969 His efforts at a larger world role have often brought harsh international attention to his nation -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Once called the `` mad dog of the Middle East , '' Libya 's often flamboyantly dressed ruler , Moammar Gadhafi , has ruled the north African nation for 42 years . 
But Libya 's 679,362 square miles and 6.4 million people have rarely seemed enough for Gadhafi , who in 2008 gathered a group of African tribal leaders and had them grant him the lofty title , `` King of Kings . '' 
It was part of his campaign for a unified Africa -- a single federation with a million-man army at its disposal -- a nation that he , naturally , would serve as president , said Ronald Bruce St. John , the author of seven books on Libya . 
`` The Libyan stage is not enough of a playhouse for Gadhafi . 
It never has been , '' St. John said . 
Gadhafi 's `` King of Kings '' ploy was only another in a string of efforts by the mercurial leader to secure a larger-than-life place for himself on the world stage , efforts that have frequently landed him and his citizens in the harsh glare of an angry international community , according to St. John . 
Gadhafi 's growing anger over the rejection of Arab and African leaders and his own growing anti-Western sentiment led him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s , said Dirk J. Vandewalle , a Libya expert at Darmouth University . 
It led to the infamous bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie , Scotland , in which 270 people died . 
`` Terrorism was a cheap way to get even with the West , '' Vandewalle said . 
Gadhafi , who will turn 69 in March , seized control of Libya in the very place where the current tumult seems strongest , the city of Benghazi . 
As an Army captain , he led a bloodless coup against King Idris on September 1 , 1969 , establishing the Libyan Arab Republic in just two hours , according to GlobalSecurity.org , an independent provider of security information . 
He established a putative system of direct democracy called Jamahiriya that supposedly allowed the nation 's citizens direct input into their government , St. John said . 
In reality , the country was sliding into a dictatorship led by Gadhafi , he said . 
In taking control of the country , he became one of a number of young revolutionaries in the region carrying a strong message of Arab nationalism in the mold of Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser , Vandewalle said . 
Although U.S. leaders initially tried working with Gadhafi , it quickly became clear he was an Arab nationalist and relations with the West quickly deteriorated , St. John said . 
By 1972 , he was urging Muslims to fight Western powers , including the United States and Great Britain , and backing black militants in the United States as he pursued a leadership position in the Arab world , seeking to succeed his political idol , Nasser , who had died in 1972 . 
But Arab leaders shunned his responses , Vandewalle said , seeing him more as a `` buffoon '' and a `` clown '' than a potential pan-Arab leader . 
That rejection , his own growing anti-Western sentiment and a lack of criticism within the tightly controlled Libyan political environment led Gadhafi to turn to terrorism , Vandewalle said . 
`` I think it was frustration more than anything else , '' he said . 
In 1986 , Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that left one American service member dead , prompting U.S. President Ronald Reagan to dub the Libyan leader the `` mad dog of the Middle East . '' 
The United States bombed targets in Libya in response and imposed economic sanctions . 
Two years later , Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland . 
In 1999 , seeking rapprochement with the West , Gadhafi succumbed to Western demands to turn over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing , and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction . 
The moves helped the country regain diplomatic relations with the United States in 2006 , but that was n't the end of Gadhafi 's touchy relations with foreign nations . 
In 2008 , Swiss officials jailed one of Gadhafi 's sons , prompting the furious leader to cut off the country 's oil supplies , withdraw the country 's money from Swiss banks and threaten to cut off diplomatic relations . 
And in 2009 , Libya and Gadhafi again became the subject of international ire in 2009 when the government granted a hero 's welcome to Abdel Basset al-Megrahi , who had been convicted in the Lockerbie bombing but was released by Scottish authorities for health reasons . 
While his politics have brought the attention of international leaders , it may be Gadhafi 's personal style that has brought him the most awareness around the world . 
Gadhafi is known for appearing in public in outrageous , sometimes outlandish , garb , St. John said . 
Images of the Libyan leaders available on the Internet show him dressed in everything from lavishly decorated military uniforms to animal prints . 
Gadhafi famously travels with a traditional Bedouin tent , whose appearance in 2009 frustrated officials in Bedford , New York , when he came to New York to address the United Nations . 
He also travels with a retinue of female bodyguards , St. John noted . 
While Gadhafi has a substantial number of enemies within Libya , his use of the county 's enormous oil revenues to provide subsidized health care , education and housing to citizens , as well as his willingness to stand up to the West , granted him a reserve of good will that he still draws on today , said Vandewalle . 
`` This was a young nationalist who stood up to the West , who nationalized the oil companies , who stood up to Great Britain and the United States , '' Vandewalle said . 
`` It was highly symbolic and there are a number of people there who still grudgingly respect him for that . ''

2011-03-28,"NAWFALIYAH\/MISRATA , Libya | Mon Mar 28 , 2011 7:22 pm EDT NAWFALIYAH\/MISRATA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels advanced west toward the birthplace of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Monday , firing mortars and heavy machineguns in sporadic clashes with loyalist forces . 
Emboldened by Western-led air strikes against Gaddafi 's troops , rebels took the town of Nawfaliyah and moved toward Sirte , Gaddafi 's home town and an important military base , in the sixth week of an uprising against his 41-year rule . 
As rebels pressed forward in the east , Gaddafi 's troops were patrolling an area near the center of Misrata after shelling the previously rebel-controlled western city for days and Arab news networks reported Western air strikes in the west of Tripoli . 
The government in Tripoli said it had `` liberated '' Misrata from rebels and declared a ceasefire there . 
Diplomatic activity accelerated on the eve of a 35-nation meeting in London on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in the oil-producing North African desert state . 
Italy proposed a deal including a ceasefire , exile for Gaddafi and dialogue between rebels and tribal leaders . 
The rebel leadership ruled out compromise with Gaddafi 's followers . 
`` We have had a vision from the very beginning and the main ingredient of this vision is the downfall of the Gaddafi regime , '' spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in eastern Libya . 
Qatar became the first Arab country to recognize the rebels as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people , in a move that may presage similar moves from other Gulf states . 
Libyan state television called the move `` blatant interference '' . 
Russia criticized the Western intervention that has turned the tide in the conflict , saying it amounted to taking sides in a civil war and breached the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution . 
U.S. SAYS REBELS NOT ROBUST U.S. Vice Admiral Bill Gortney said on Monday the rebels fighting Gaddafi were not robust and the gains they have made on the battlefield in recent days were tenuous . 
Gortney , director of the U.S. military 's Joint Staff , said the United States was not directly supporting the opposition but it had achieved a military benefit from coalition air strikes . 
He said the United States had no confirmed report of any civilian casualty caused by coalition forces and that coalition had fired six Tomahawk cruise missiles in the past 24 hours and had carried out 178 air sorties . 
The French and British leaders called for supporters of Gaddafi to abandon him and asked Libyans opposing him to join a political process to pave the way for his departure . 
`` Gaddafi must go immediately , '' President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister David Cameron said in a joint statement . 
`` We call on all his supporters to drop him before it is too late . '' 
In the nine days since the start of the Western-led bombing , the motley volunteer force of rebels has pressed half-way along the coast from its stronghold of Benghazi toward Tripoli and regained control of major oil terminals in the OPEC state . 
A U.S. Treasury Department official said rebels could sell Libyan crude without being subject to U.S. sanctions if they conducted the transactions outside entities in Gaddafi 's administration subject to sanctions . 
With its finances under pressure , the rebel leadership said it hopes to restart oil exports within a week . 
Some energy traders said that , sanctions aside , they could not touch Libyan oil because of shipping and legal risks . 
On Monday rebels met sporadic resistance as they pushed their advance in convoys of pick-up trucks with machineguns . 
Just west of sandy , barren Nawfaliyah , bursts of sustained machinegun fire and the whoosh of several rockets could be heard , and plumes of black smoke rose ahead . 
`` Those are from our guns , '' said Faisal Bozgaia , 28 , a hospital worker turned rebel fighter , pointing to the smoke . 
Rebels said occasional ambushes by Gaddafi forces had pushed them back but that they later regained their positions . 
`` We are advancing one , two kilometers at a time , '' rebel Khalif Ali , 22 , said in the town of Harawah , west of Nawfaliyah . 
But the rapid advance is stretching rebel supply lines . 
`` We have a serious problem with petrol , '' said a volunteer fighter waiting to fill up in the oil town of Ras Lanuf . 
Reuters correspondent Michael Georgy , reporting from Sirte to the west , saw police and military but no sign of fighting . 
Soldiers were manning checkpoints and green Libyan flags flapped in the wind . 
Militiamen fired AK-47 rifles defiantly into the air . 
`` If they come to Sirte , we will defend our city , '' said Osama bin Nafaa , 32 , a policeman . 
In Misrata , Gaddafi soldiers manned checkpoints and took up position on rooftops . 
Some housefronts were smashed , smoke was rising from several areas and gunfire rang out across the city . 
Several civilians approached a group of journalists , some of them woman and children waving green flags . 
`` Misrata is ours , there are still some bad guys in other parts , but Gaddafi is winning , the city is ours , '' resident Abduq Karim said . 
`` Civilians are happy , '' said an army official who declined to be named . 
`` Everything you are hearing is a lie . 
The function of our army is to save the people and to protect the leader . 
We can not kill our own people . '' 
A rebel spokesman in another western town , Zintan , said forces loyal to Gaddafi had bombarded the town with rockets early on Monday , Al Jazeera reported . 
Western-led air strikes began on March 19 , two days after the U.N. Security Council authorized `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . 
But from the outset , the mission faced questions about its scope and aims , including the extent to which it will actively back the rebel side and whether it might target Gaddafi himself . 
The start of allied bombings proved a turning point for the rebels who were hemmed into Benghazi at the time . 
Russia , which abstained in the U.N. vote , said Western attacks on Gaddafi forces amounted to taking sides . 
`` We consider that intervention by the coalition in what is essentially an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference . 
NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the BBC : `` We are there to protect civilians -- no more , no less . '' 
France , which dropped the first bombs of the campaign nine days ago , said the coalition was strictly complying with U.N. terms . 
It said its warplanes struck a command center south of Tripoli belonging to Gaddafi 's forces on Sunday and Monday . 
The Defense Ministry in London said British Tornado aircraft destroyed Libyan government ammunition bunkers in the Sabha area of Libya 's southern desert in the early hours of Monday . 
On Sunday , NATO agreed to take full command of military operations in Libya after a week of heated negotiations . 
The United States , which led the initial phase , had sought to scale back its role in another Muslim country after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
An alliance spokeswoman said on Monday the transition would take a couple of days . 
Libya accused NATO of `` terrorizing '' and killing its people as part of a global plot to humiliate and weaken it . 
A Libyan government spokesman said on Monday night that Western air strikes in Sabha , 700 km -LRB- 420 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , killed 12-13 civilians the night before . 
Libyan television reported an air strike on Surman , west of Tripoli . 
The government says the Western-led air attacks have killed more than 100 civilians , a charge denied by the coalition which says it is protecting civilians from Gaddafi forces and targeting only military sites to enforce a no-fly zone . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Gaddafi better listen to the Arab union folks talking to him . 
He , and his family can still get a good exit deal . 
A billion bucks , and get back all his property in England . 
You Fight To Be A Man Your Whole Life , In Order To Protect The Children That You Wish To Be .

2011-03-29,"By the CNN Wire Staff The president gives interviews to all three major U.S. television networks Moammar Gadhafi can end the coalition bombardment by stepping down , Obama says Obama says pressure is increasing on Gadhafi 's inner circle to end the conflict -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On a day when opposition forces in Libya suffered battlefield losses , President Barack Obama made clear in interviews Tuesday with the three major U.S. television networks that he was open to arming the rebel fighters . 
`` I 'm not ruling it out , but I 'm also not ruling it in , '' Obama told NBC in one of the separate interviews he gave the day after a nationally televised speech on the Libya situation . 
`` I think it 's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could , '' Obama told ABC . 
`` We 're looking at all our options at this point . '' 
The president also signaled a willingness to negotiate a settlement to the conflict with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , but only based on the condition that Gadhafi would relinquish power as called for by the United States and its allies . 
Asked about the chances of Gadhafi fleeing or losing vital support from his family and top aides , Obama said that he believes those close to the Libyan leader likely feel what he called a tightening noose . 
`` I think that Gadhafi 's camp , people around him , are starting to recognize that their options are limited and their days are numbered , and so they are probably reaching out to a range of different people , '' Obama told CBS . 
`` But that information may not have filtered to Gadhafi yet and I think it 's too early for us to start having formal negotiations . '' 
Will U.S. arm Libya 's rebels ? 
Reaction to Obama 's Libya speech Gadhafi `` knows exactly what he needs to do to stop the constant bombardment that he 's under , and it may at some point shift to him to figuring out how to negotiate an exit , but I do n't think we 're at that point yet , '' Obama continued on CBS . 
On ABC , the president said that `` the first step is for Gadhafi to send a signal that he understands the Libyan people do n't want him ruling anymore , that 40 years of tyranny is enough . '' 
`` Once he makes that decision , I think the international community will come together and make a determination as to what the most appropriate way of facilitating him stepping down will be , '' Obama said . 
The interviews continued the determined tone of Obama 's Monday night speech , which detailed the strategic and moral reasons for committing U.S. troops to the Libyan mission while also promising the U.S. role would be limited in time and scope . 
Initially led by U.S. forces due to their `` unique capabilities '' for taking out Libya 's anti-aircraft and communications stations to establish a no-fly zone , the mission shifts to NATO control this week so allied nations share the responsibility and costs , Obama said . 
He pointed out to CBS that coalition airstrikes on Gadhafi forces threatening civilian populations `` will continue for some time '' despite the transfer in mission leadership . 
`` One of the questions that we want to answer is , do we start getting to a stage where Gadhafi 's forces are sufficiently degraded , where it may not be necessary to arm opposition groups ? '' 
Obama said on CBS .

2011-03-29,"By John Sepulvado , CNN Radio Khaled Ahmed , known as Khaled M. , poses in Chicago as part of the `` Ca n't Take Our Freedom '' picture campaign . 
Khaled Ahmed performs under the rap name Khaled M. The U.S.-born Libyan-American uses music to share a message of freedom for his homeland His song `` Ca n't Take Our Freedom '' has built buzz on the internet and he has a following Chicago -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On an unusually warm Chicago night , Khaled Ahmed sits on a stoop outside the towering John Hancock building in downtown , talking about his childhood . 
The way Ahmed tells it , he may have been a bit of a knucklehead growing up in Lexington , Kentucky . 
As teenage boys sometimes do , especially when bored , Ahmed threw eggs at houses , played pranks on neighbors , and would ditch school occasionally . 
He rooted for the University of Kentucky Wildcats , rode his bike around town , and listened to Lauryn Hill , Tupac Shakur and Nas . 
`` Yeah , it was a pretty normal childhood , for the most part , '' Ahmed says . 
`` Except I grew up wanting to assassinate -LRB- Libyan leader Moammar -RRB- Gadhafi . '' 
Ahmed , a 26-year-old U.S.-born Libyan-American , is better known as the rapper Khaled M. His father , Mohamed Ahmed , and mother , Wafa Nashnoush , spent most of their lives protesting the Gadhafi regime . 
Now , Khaled M. is doing the same in the song `` Ca n't Take Our Freedom . '' 
Ahmed grew up in Lexington 's Libyan community . 
His father was a Libyan political prisoner from 1972 to 1977 , after leading student groups against Gadhafi . 
Mohamed Ahmed was able to escape prison , flee Libya and lead opposition groups from abroad . 
But after three years of running , the family decided to raise Khaled and his two brothers in one town . 
The family settled in Kentucky , Khaled says , because `` Gadhafi 's assassins would never look for members of the opposition in Lexington . '' 
`` Every day , for the first five years I can remember , we lived with the paranoia that Gadhafi 's thugs would come to the door like they did to political opponents living in Europe , '' he says . 
After college at the University of Kentucky , Khaled moved to Chicago to pursue his rap career . 
`` Ca n't Take Our Freedom '' is his only overtly political song -- and his biggest hit . 
In the first week , the video for the song got more than 50,000 plays on YouTube . 
`` It is a tremendous feeling knowing people in Libya are hearing that message , '' he says . 
`` And not just there , but Indonesia and Argentina . 
There are a lot of people around the world who want to see a free Libya . '' 
It is quite a transition for Ahmed , who began rapping about girls back in sixth grade . 
`` It was never my intention to be a political rapper , or write political songs , '' he says . 
But , he adds , he felt compelled to record the song as the protests in Libya turned into a civil war . 
`` I felt like I had to stand up with them , in the way I know how . '' 
As the sun goes down and the wind picks up , we start winding down our interview . 
Ahmed , dressed in a black pea coat , flat cap and square-rimmed glasses , is looking down at his phone , trying to pick up more news about the fighting in Libya . 
Just then , two young women carrying shopping bags approach . 
Khaled is oblivious to them as he scrolls through his phone . 
They stand in front of him for a moment before asking if they can take his picture . 
`` Absolutely , '' he says . 
He stands up , and the woman with a free hand whips out her phone and snaps a quick shot . 
As they begin to leave , Ahmed shakes her hand , while his manager , who is on hand for the interview , quickly hands her fliers for an upcoming show . 
Ahmed 's manager Darrin Rich tells me that during that time , people have begun noticing the rapper with the trademark flat hat on the street . 
In the past month , he has been featured in more than a dozen national and local news profiles . 
As the two women leave , Ahmed seems unfazed . 
He plops back down on the stoop . 
`` I 'm not going to tell you it 's not nice being noticed , '' he says as he leans back against a concrete wall . 
`` But I think success comes for me personally only if I stay humble , if I stay happy , if I stay on a straight path . '' 
He looks straight down while he talks -- his eyes glued to the phone , searching for more news from Libya .

2011-03-29,"By Pam Benson , CNN National Security Producer Khamis Gadhafi , son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , was seen on live Libyan state TV Monday night . 
NEW : Libyan leaders son , Khamis Gadhafi . 
seen on live TV Monday NEW : The younger Gadhafi 's TV appearance counters rumors of his death Youngest son runs elite special forces Internship sponsor `` shocked and outraged '' by son 's role in fighting Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's youngest son , who runs the country 's elite special forces for his father 's regime , was on an internship program in the United States when public unrest exploded in Libya last month . 
Khamis Gadhafi abruptly cut off his visit and returned to Libya , where he has led the 32nd Reinforced Brigade , known at the Khamis Brigade , in its brutal suppression of rebel forces . 
The brigade 's headquarters was the target of six Tomahawk missiles overnight , according to Vice Adm. William Gortney of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . 
Gortney described the brigade as `` one of the most active in terms of attacking innocent people . '' 
Libya 's state TV on Monday night broadcast live footage from Gadhafi 's Tripoli compound of Khamis Gadhafi dressed in uniform and greeting people . 
Prior to the broadcast there had been unconfirmed reports that the younger Gadhafi had died from injuries he suffered when a plane flown by a disgruntled Libyan pilot crashed into a military compound while he was there . 
ABC News was the first to report Khamis Gadhafi 's recent stay in the United States . 
Gadhafi opposition runs into resistance AECOM has business dealings with Libya . 
The younger Gadhafi traveled from coast to coast meeting with high-tech companies , universities and defense contractors . 
His itinerary included stops in San Francisco , Los Angeles , Colorado , Chicago , Houston , Washington and New York City . 
Khamis Gadhafi left the United States for Libya on February 17 . 
Paul Gennaro , the senior vice president and chief communications officer for AECOM , issued a statement saying , `` The educational internship , which consisted of publicly available information , was aligned with our efforts to improve quality of life , specifically in Libya , where we were advancing public infrastructure such as access to clean water ; quality housing ; safe and efficient roads and bridges ; reliable and affordable energy ; and related projects that create jobs and opportunity . '' 
Gennaro said the company was `` shocked and outraged '' to learn of Khamis Gadhafi 's role in the Libyan crisis . 
`` We were aware of the student 's family relationship , but we were not informed of any military connection whatsoever , '' Gennaro said . 
It was the company 's understanding that Khamis Gadhafi was an MBA student from an accredited university in Spain . 
`` The student was positioned to help oversee improvements in Libya 's quality of life and infrastructure initiatives , which the country had been advancing since 2007 , '' he said . 
The U.S. State Department was aware of and approved all the meetings , Gennaro said . 
According to Gennaro , AECOM did not provide any funding for either Khamis Gadhafi or the internship program . 
Since 2008 , AECOM has been involved in a multibillion-dollar initiative with Libya to modernize the country 's infrastructure . 
The company withdrew all its expatriate employees and their families from Libya earlier this month . 
The joint project to train Libyan engineers to build and maintain homes , roads and water systems is on hold .

2011-03-29,"By Jennifer Rizzo , CNN National Security Producer The Global Hawk high-flying unmanned aircraft is just one of the military resources being employed by the U.S. in Libya . 
The United States provides high-tech military equipment to the Libyan operation `` There are things we can do that our allies ca n't do , '' says one expert U.S. capabilities including surveillance and communications jamming Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the United States transfers control of the Libyan operation to NATO , officials say the American military will continue to be a part of the effort . 
Since the operation began more than a week ago , the United States ' `` unique capabilities '' have been referred to time and time again by U.S. officials , from the president to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates . 
But what exactly does that mean ? 
The U.S. has military tools that other coalition and NATO countries do not , or do not have as much of , including surveillance and communication jamming capabilities that are major keys to any successful operation or war . 
`` The United States buys as much high-tech military equipment as all the rest of the world combined , '' says national security and weapons expert Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute . 
`` Because of that , there are things that we can do that our allies ca n't do , like jamming radars , and collecting intelligence . '' 
Without these capabilities the coalition would have thought twice about the operation , Thompson says . 
Woman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces `` Our European allies would be reluctant to take on military combat in Libya unless they had support from the U.S. because there are so many advanced military systems that they do not have themselves , '' he says . 
The U.S. role however , will not be at the forefront just because of the high-tech weaponry , says defense expert John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org . 
`` It will be more of a supporting role than a pointy end of the spear role , '' said Pike . 
`` Most of these unique capabilities are support . '' 
At a Pentagon briefing Monday , U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney described the U.S. role in Libya by saying , `` Maybe we are n't flying the bulk of combat sorties any more , but the U.S. is now providing nearly 80 % of all air refueling , almost 75 % of aerial surveillance hours and 100 % of all electronic warfare missions . '' 
Here 's a partial list of what is being used by the United States in the Libya mission , based on Defense Department information , Jane 's defense publications and various analysts : -- The Global Hawk : A high-flying , unmanned aircraft that provides intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance . 
Its very long endurance allows it to stay in flight longer than any manned and unmanned aircraft . 
The Global Hawk collects pictures and video of the ground and some versions have the ability of electronic eaves dropping . 
This allows the aircraft to see the location of Libyan troops and activity at their various military sites . 
It is also helpful in assessing the success of strikes on targets and bomb damage . 
-- Joint STARS -LRB- Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System -RRB- : An intelligence and surveillance aircraft with radar capabilities tucked underneath the plane . 
Different than the Global Hawk , this aircraft is manned . 
The radar looks sideways at the ground , allowing it to see moving ground targets , such as Libyan tank movements . 
The Joint STARS ' very sensitive radar system generates its own radio waves , sending them out , and then receiving radar returns , which allows it to create pictures of what is on the ground . 
Operating with radar waves allows Joint STARS to take pictures at night , without light . 
-- AWACS -LRB- Airborne Warning and Control System -RRB- : This is a radar aircraft like the Joint STARS , capable of surveillance , but is used for monitoring aircraft such as Libyan planes or helicopters , instead of monitoring ground forces . 
The radar is a rotating dome on the top of the aircraft . 
Besides tracking enemy planes , the AWACS also monitors allied aircraft , directing friendly planes to the best location for targeting . 
-- Maritime Patrol Aircraft , P-3 : An older propeller aircraft mostly used to monitor vessels and submarines at sea but it can also track ground targets . 
Enforcing the arms embargo on Libya is a main task . 
The aircraft can track electronic emissions like radio waves , allowing the coalition to listen in on enemy radio transmissions . 
The P-3 is also capable of identifying the types of communication and radar systems the enemy is using by differentiating between the unique electronic signals being sent out . 
-- EA-18G Growler : An aircraft used to jam radar and other enemy communications and electronic signals . 
With pods on its wings and under its fuselage , the Growler identifies what kind of emitters the enemy is using for its radar and communication devices . 
Then it puts out a much stronger signal on the same line , causing the enemy 's communication devices or radars to not function properly . 
The Growler focused on disrupting Libya 's air defense radar systems in the beginning of the operation . 
-- Commando Solo : The aircraft disrupts enemy radio signals , allowing the United States to broadcast its own message on enemy channels . 
In this operation the U.S. is transmitting messages to Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in both Arabic and in English , telling them to stop fighting and leave their weapons . 
`` Although we will not discuss specifics , Commando Solo could be used to transmit information to regime military forces to cease hostilities or broadcast humanitarian relief information to the Libyan public , such as where people can get basic food and water supplies , '' the Pentagon says . 
-- Compass Call : The aircraft disrupts the enemy 's command and control communications with electronic jamming . 
Operated by the Air Force . 
While a similar capability to the Growler , the Compass Call is mostly focused on taking out the Libyan forces ' communications . 
This jamming ability causes the Libyan commanders to not be able to communicate with their forces in the field . 
-- Air refueling tankers : Basically an in-flight gas station for U.S. and coalition fighter jets enforcing the no-fly zone , allowing the jets to stay in the air longer and cover larger distances .

2011-03-29,"By David Gergen , CNN Senior Political Analyst President Barack Obama 's decision to intervene in Libya had only middling support in polls David Gergen says a key aim of Obama 's speech was to build support for his decision He says Obama made a good case for action but was vague on potential outcomes Gergen : Obama laid out a much more cautious , collaborative approach than past presidents Editor 's note : David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been an adviser to four U.S. presidents . 
He is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government . 
For another view , read '' Now the tricky part '' and for Fareed Zakaria 's analysis , read here . 
Cambridge , Massachusetts -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Now that the `` commentariat '' has had its say about President Barack Obama 's speech Monday night on Libya , chewing over every phrase , the decisive American verdict about his address rests not in television studios but in homes across the country . 
And so , if I may , let me ask : What did you think ? 
Do you believe that the president made a compelling case for military intervention by the U.S. and its coalition partners ? 
Before the speech , a Pew survey found that a bare 47 % thought the president had made the right decision in intervening , compared with 36 % who disagreed . 
That was the lowest level of support in years for a president sending U.S. troops into harm 's way . 
After the speech , there was a near-universal view among commentators that the president had indeed made a convincing argument on behalf of intervention . 
I was among those who believed so . 
But what about you , the people who count ? 
Do you believe that the president was clear about his goals and what should come next in Libya ? 
Before the speech , Pew showed that a strong majority -- 50 % to 39 % -- thought that Obama has not been clear about U.S. goals there . 
Afterward , the pundits were split on whether he answered the big question of where this goes . 
I was among those who believe that he left enormous vagueness -LRB- e.g. , the stated mission has been to defend citizens from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces , but with a rebel force now on the offensive , should NATO give assistance ? 
What do we do if there is a stalemate and Gadhafi clings to power ? 
What happens , on the other hand , if there is an internal coup and Gadhafi is overthrown ; will the U.S. be heavily engaged in nation building ? -RRB- . 
I did not think the president clearly answered those questions . 
But more important than what commentators thought -- what did you think ? 
Did the president enunciate a new Obama doctrine about the uses of U.S. military power that you find appealing ? 
As CNN 's Wolf Blitzer said after the speech , we clearly heard Monday night the beginnings of an Obama doctrine -- the clearest enunciation he has provided so far of his views on the use of force . 
Some thought he was opening the door to the possible use of military force in other Middle Eastern nations that are shooting protesters -LRB- e.g. , Syria , Bahrain , Yemen -RRB- ; I thought just the opposite , that the president was closing the door unless there was horrific violence and a number of other exceptional circumstances . 
To me , the speech laid out a vision of U.S. leadership that was much more limited , cautious and collaborative than we have had in recent presidents -- certainly a far cry from the muscularity of President John F. Kennedy 's inaugural address that said we would pay any price , meet any burden in the defense of liberty . 
A half century ago , Americans rallied to JFK 's call , but today , when Americans are weary of war and feeling broke , perhaps people will find his more cautious approach more appealing . 
How did you interpret his `` doctrine '' and what do you think of it ? 
Give the president credit : His speech has advanced an important dialogue not only about Libya but about American leadership in the world . 
What did you think ? 
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen .

2011-03-29,"Defense Secretary Robert Gates says he 's seen no indication that coalition attacks have killed Libyan civilians . 
NEW : Armed Services chairman says the mission is to allow the Libyan people to oust Gadhafi NEW : GOP Sen. Lugar says the use of military force should have been debated Gates says the goal is to increase pressure for Gadhafi 's ouster No evidence so far of missile strikes killing civilians , Gates says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Presidential leadership or kowtowing to allies ? 
Abuse of power or decisive action in the face of imminent catastrophe ? 
Supporters and critics used Sunday talk shows to debate President Barack Obama 's Libya policy on Sunday , the day before the president addresses the nation on the issue . 
The speech Monday night follows calls from all quarters for Obama to clarify the reason he sent U.S. forces to head the U.N.-authorized military mission intended to prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from unleashing his military on his own people . 
Obama has said that U.S. policy is the ouster of Gadhafi . 
However , the mandate of the military coalition is only to enforce a no-fly zone and arms embargo in Libya while taking other necessary steps to protect civilians . 
Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , explained on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' that the mission 's goal is to give the Libyan people the political freedom to oust Gadhafi . 
`` We 're part of an international coalition , which has been supported now by U.N. resolution with the support of Arab countries , to prevent the slaughter of civilians in Libya , '' Levin said , adding : `` It 's going to take the people of Libya to remove their dictator with the help of economic sanctions that the world has put in place . '' 
Meanwhile , two senior Cabinet members -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates -- appeared on three programs in interviews conducted Saturday to also make the case for the Obama policy . 
Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her NATO 's role in Libya unclear `` There is no perfect option when one is looking at a situation like this , '' Clinton said on the ABC program `` This Week . '' 
`` I think that the president ordered the best available option . 
The United States worked with the international community to make sure that there was authorization to do what we have helped to accomplish . '' 
Both Clinton and Levin emphasized that the international support was essential to avoid any perception or accusation that the United States -- already engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- was unilaterally committing military forces in a third Muslim country . 
`` The secret to success is a coalition , '' Levin told CNN , advocating an `` international decision where a unilateral decision could have significant downsides . '' 
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who is expected to announce his candidacy soon for the Republican presidential nomination , challenged such an approach , telling `` Fox News Sunday '' he wants Obama 's speech to be `` dramatically clearer than he has been up until now . '' 
`` I hope the president will say , first of all he is consulting the U.S. Congress , not just the Arab League and United Nations , '' Gingrich said . 
`` I hope he will say second that it 's clear that the Gadhafi dictatorship has to leave , and that we are prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure the Gadhafi dictatorship leaves . '' 
Despite his tough rhetoric , Gingrich made clear he opposes sending any U.S. ground troops to Libya -- a position also held by Obama . 
`` Once you engage air power , you should use the air power in its most effective way , '' Gingrich said . 
`` You do n't need to send in ground forces . '' 
Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee , criticized a lack of congressional debate before Obama committed military forces to the Libyan mission . 
`` There should have been a plan as to what our objectives were , a debate , before we committed armed resources , '' Lugar told the NBC program `` Meet the Press , '' later adding : `` I do n't believe we should be engaged in the Libyan civil war . 
I think the Libyans are going to have to work that out . '' 
Obama has said the U.S. role in the Libyan mission will diminish once NATO takes over control and command , which could start happening as soon as Monday . 
However , Gates made clear that even in a diminished role , U.S. forces will still be involved in the mission as long as it continues . 
`` As long as there is a no-fly zone and we have some unique capabilities to bring to bear -- for example , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , some tanking aviation -- we will continue to have a presence , '' he said on ABC . 
So far , he said , the military mission was proceeding well . 
`` I would say , for all practical purposes , the implementation of the no-fly zone is complete , '' Gates said . 
`` Now it will need to be sustained , but it can be sustained with a lot less effort than what it took to set it up . '' 
Asked if there was a problem between the military mission 's limited goal of civilian protection and Obama 's stated policy objective of ousting Gadhafi , both Gates and Clinton said no. `` You do n't , in a military campaign , set as a mission or a goal something you are not sure you can achieve , '' Gates told the CBS program `` Face the Nation . '' 
`` And as we 've learned over the past number of years , regime change is very complicated and can be very expensive and can take a long time . 
So I think the key here was establishing a military mission that was achievable , was achievable in a limited period of time and could be sustained . '' 
On the same program , Clinton noted how former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic remained in power despite mounting internal and external pressure for his ouster that ended with Milosevic dying while on trial in the international war crimes court . 
She likened that situation to Gadhafi today . 
`` It took a while for Milosevic to leave , but you could see his days were numbered even though he was n't yet out of office , '' Clinton said . 
Gates joked on CBS that he `` would n't be hanging any new pictures '' if he were Gadhafi , then noted that there are several possible scenarios for the Libyan leader 's ouster . 
`` His military can turn , we could see elements of his military turning , deciding this is a no-win proposition , the families splitting , I mean any number of possibilities are out there , particularly as long as the international pressure continues , and those around him see no future in staying with him , '' Gates said . 
On the same program , Gates also said that Gadhafi is placing bodies of people his regime has killed at the sites of some missile strikes by the U.S.-led coalition . 
Gadhafi has claimed that coalition missile attacks have killed civilians , and some NATO members and Arab nations responded with concern that the Libyan military mission might exceed the intent of the U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized it . 
`` The truth of the matter is we have trouble coming up with proof of any civilian casualties that we have been responsible for , '' Gates told CBS . 
`` But we do have a lot of intelligence reporting about Gadhafi taking the bodies of the people he 's killed and putting them at the sites where we 've attacked . '' 
Asked how often it has happened , Gates replied : `` We have a number of reports of that . '' 
A senior defense official told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. military has information gleaned from intelligence sources that Gadhafi has tasked his aides to search morgues and hospitals for dead bodies to be posed as civilian casualties . 
NATO ambassadors on Sunday agreed to rules of engagement for coalition forces to follow once the alliance takes over the Libyan mission . 
A key question is how robust the NATO-led forces will be in attacking Libyan ground forces to protect civilians . 
That does n't mean using military force to remove Gadhafi from power , Levin insisted on CNN . 
`` The people of Libya can remove their dictator , but we are not the ones to remove him , '' Levin said . 
`` We are the ones that is part of an international coalition that are going to prevent him from massacring his own people . '' 
Others called for a more robust international role . 
`` I think we do need to consider arming the rebels and let them -- with anti-tank weapons and anti-aircraft weapons -- let them impose their own no-fly zone , '' former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said on CNN . 
`` In the end of the day , how this ends is when the Libyan people can overthrow the tyrant . 
That 's the narrative we want to establish . '' 
Lieberman , an independent who caucuses with the Democrats , said on Fox that the United States had chosen a side in Libya by joining the international coalition , `` and it 's the right side . '' 
`` We ought to be open about it , '' Lieberman said . 
`` We are taking a side of the freedom fighters in Libya against one of the most totalitarian regimes that has ever existed in the world , which is Gadhafi 's . 
And in the end of this , Gadhafi has to go , one way or the other . ''

2011-03-29,"By Jennifer Rizzo , CNN National Security Producer Adm. James Stavridis says there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda in the Libyan opposition . 
He sees `` more than reasonable '' chance Gadhafi will leave power Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There is a good chance NATO pressure will encourage Libyan tyrant Moammar Gadhafi to leave power , the U.S. NATO commander told Congress Tuesday , but the opposition that could come in the Libyan leader 's wake has `` flickers '' of al Qaeda . 
While there is a wide range of possible outcomes in Libya , running from a static stalemate to Gadhafi cracking , there is a `` more than reasonable '' chance of Gadhafi leaving power , Adm. James Stavridis said before the Senate Armed Services Committee , But potential `` flickers '' of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements have been seen in intelligence regarding the Libyan opposition , which is poised to take power if Gadhafi leaves , Stavridis said . 
However , he added there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda or other terrorist groups . 
Stavridis is also the commander of U.S. European Command . 
`` The intelligence that I 'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I 'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi , '' Stavridis added . 
The comments come the same day as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of Libya 's opposition in London . 
Clinton and the heads of 40 other countries met Tuesday to discuss Libya 's future . 
A senior counterterrorism official , unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record , backed up Stavridis ' assessment , downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition . 
There is probably `` a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda '' in Libya among the rebels , `` but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates , '' the official said . 
Al Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years . 
It `` would n't be surprising if small numbers -- a handful '' -- of extremists or al Qaeda are in Libya . 
`` It 's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition , '' the official said , but `` the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya . '' 
If Gadhafi 's forces cease fighting there would be a series of decisions on how NATO should proceed . 
Leading the senators through the NATO command chain , Stavridis said the intelligence and ground assessments would work their way up through NATO , first going through Canadian Gen. Charles Bouchard leading the NATO operation in Libya , then up to Stavridis and eventually going up to the United Nations for the ultimate decision on course of action , Stavridis said . 
`` I think there would be actually another level that this discussion would have to go to , which would be the United Nations since the authority for NATO to participate in this operation is under the United Nations Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 , '' Stavridis pointed out . 
During this process there would be a pause in NATO activity over Libya . 
But for now the fight is still very much on . 
No-fly air zones have been set up to allow air assets to strike Libyan forces if the civilian population is threatened , Stavridis said , going beyond a basic no-fly zone patrol mission . 
For the first time , A-10 and AC-130 ground attack aircraft were used over the weekend in Libya , Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at a press briefing on Monday . 
These aircraft fire machine gun rounds from cannons , up to thousands of rounds a minute , and due to their low-altitude flying ability provide more precision in densely populated areas . 
On Monday night , one A-10 aircraft attacked Libyan coast guard ships in the port of Misrata after reports were confirmed that the ships were firing at merchant vessels . 
NATO is set to take control of the full operation in Libya including protecting civilians on Thursday , greatly easing the financial costs on the United States , which has already hit $ 550 million as of Monday , according to Pentagon figures . 
Of those costs , 60 % were for munitions , the Pentagon said , including Tomahawk missiles , which cost $ 1.4 million each . 
The United States has launched approximately 200 since the beginning of the operation . 
`` Future costs are highly uncertain , '' Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kessler said , but the U.S. expects to incur another $ 40 million in costs over the next three weeks . 
After the transition to NATO control is complete , the Pentagon expects the cost of the U.S. support operation to drop significantly , costing $ 40 million per each subsequent month .

2011-03-29,"By the CNN Wire Staff Among the missing in Libya are `` those suspected of being rebel fighters or supporters of fighters , '' says Amnesty International . 
It appears to be a `` systematic policy , '' it says There likely are many more unreported cases , the organization says -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Atef ` Abd al-Qader Al-Atrash is a 32-year-old Libyan blogger , government critic , and a father of two young children . 
He has not been seen since a February 18 gathering near Benghazi . 
Amnesty International said in a briefing paper issued Tuesday that Al-Atrash is one of many people who have vanished in what they say is a `` campaign of enforced disappearances '' -- a practice by pro-Moammar Gadhafi forces trying to squelch the opposition movement . 
The paper -- titled `` Libya : Detainees , Disappeared and Missing '' -- explores more than 30 cases of people who have disappeared since protests started in the war-torn North African nation . 
Among those missing are political activists and `` those suspected of being rebel fighters or supporters of fighters . '' 
`` It appears that there is a systematic policy to detain anyone suspected of opposition to Colonel al-Gaddafi 's rule , hold them incommunicado , and transfer them to his strongholds in western Libya , '' said Malcolm Smart , Amnesty International 's director for the Middle East and North Africa . 
`` Given the circumstances of their enforced disappearance there is every reason to believe that these individuals are at serious risk of torture and ill-treatment . '' 
Witness : ` Utter carnage ' in Misrata Smart called on Gadhafi to `` halt this outrageous campaign and order his forces to abide by international law . '' 
Amnesty says the documented cases `` are believed to represent only a small proportion of the total number of people who have been detained or have disappeared '' recently in Gadhafi 's custody . 
Recent video indicates the extent of the problem . 
It shows prisoners roughed up and taunted by Gadhafi forces . 
Some of them say there were demonstrators and others deny it . 
`` The true number is impossible to establish , as the authorities in Tripoli generally do not divulge information about detainees they are holding and because many areas of the country are not accessible for independent reporting . 
Some relatives of detainees are also unwilling to publicize their names for fear of possible reprisals , '' Amnesty said . 
Libyan officials did not immediately respond to efforts to obtain a response to the Amnesty International report . 
The cases include `` three broad categories , '' the report says : -- Government critics , pro-democracy activists , writers and others detained in the days before the February 17 `` peaceful demonstrations '' across Libya . 
`` They appear to have been arrested by the authorities as a pre-emptive strike in an effort to nip the protests in the bud following the public protests that had caused the downfall of longstanding repressive governments in Tunisia and Egypt , two of Libya 's neighbors . '' 
-- Anti-government protestors and youths who went missing on February 20 , when the Kateeba al-Fadheel , a pro-Gadhafi special forces unit , was forced to evacuate from a military compound in Benghazi after violent clashes with protesters . 
`` Amnesty International has documented the cases of nine men and boys who have not been seen since they went to the Kateeba compound area on evening of 20 February 2011 , including four teenagers under 18 . '' 
-- People captured in or near Ben Jawad , where there had been `` intermittent fighting . '' 
`` Amnesty International has obtained information about a number of individuals who went missing in the area between Ajdabiya and Ben Jawad , west of Benghazi . 
Some are believed to have been fighters , others to be civilians who went to the area in order to assist the wounded , and still others people who may have been onlookers . '' 
Amnesty said foreign journalists who had been detained and released `` have reported that they were beaten and assaulted and threatened with execution , in some cases even being subjected to mock execution , and have expressed concern about Libyans who they saw being mistreated in detention . '' 
It said there are fears too that some detainees may be held `` as bargaining chips or to put pressure on their relatives and friends to deter them from joining the opposition . '' 
The agency said its concerns `` are heightened by the long pattern of gross and widespread human rights violations '' that have marked Gadhafi 's rule . 
`` These include enforced disappearances , extrajudicial executions , prolonged arbitrary detention , torture and other ill-treatment , as well as severe restrictions on freedom of expression and the rights to freedom of assembly and association . '' 
Amnesty is urging the government to release peaceful protesters , ensure than any alleged captured fighters be treated humanely and given access to the Red Cross , and grant `` unhindered access '' to humanitarian groups . 
As for Atef ` Abd al-Qader Al-Atrash , his family fears for his safety . 
One relative told Amnesty that `` he has simply disappeared , '' and speculates he was taken to areas under the control of pro-Gadhafi forces . 
`` We kept trying to call his phone but never got through , until some days later when a man who spoke with a western -LRB- western Libyan -RRB- accent answered and said : ` this is what happens to those who throw stones at us ' . 
But Atef had never even thrown stones , '' the relative said .

2011-03-29,"TRIPOLI | Tue Mar 29 , 2011 7:12 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi 's better armed and organized troops reversed the rapid westward advance of rebels on Tuesday as world powers meeting in London piled pressure on the Libyan leader to step down . 
A conference of 40 governments and international bodies agreed to press on with a NATO-led aerial bombardment of Libyan forces until Gaddafi complied with a U.N. resolution to end violence against civilians . 
It also set up a contact group comprising 20 countries and organizations , including Arab states , the African Union and the Arab League , to coordinate international support for an orderly transition to democracy in Libya . 
`` All of us must continue to increase the pressure on and deepen the isolation of the Gaddafi regime through other means as well , '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said after the London talks finished . 
`` This includes a unified front of political and diplomatic pressure that makes clear to Gaddafi that he must go . '' 
The United States , Britain and Qatar suggested that Gaddafi and his family could be allowed to go into exile if they took up the offer quickly to end six weeks of bloodshed . 
Washington and Paris also raised the possibility of arming the rebels , although both stressed no decision had been taken . 
However , U.S. President Barack Obama told NBC television that he had already agreed to provide aid such as communications equipment , medical supplies and potentially transportation aid to the Libyan opposition , but no military hardware . 
Without the help of air strikes , the rebels seem unable to make advances or even hold positions , and on the ground the pendulum of fighting swung back Gaddafi 's way . 
It took five days of foreign air strikes to pulverize Libyan government tanks around the town of Ajdabiyah before Gaddafi 's troops fled and the rebels rushed in and began a 300-km -LRB- 200-mile -RRB- , two-day dash across the desert to within 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- of the Gaddafi loyalist stronghold of Sirte . 
But the rebel pick-up truck cavalcade was first ambushed , then outflanked by Gaddafi troops . 
Government forces retook the small town of Nawfaliyah , 120 km -LRB- 75 miles -RRB- east of Sirte , and rebels said they had been pushed back a further 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- to the outskirts of the larger Bin Jawad . 
`` The Gaddafi guys hit us with Grads -LRB- rockets -RRB- and they came round our flanks , '' Ashraf Mohammed , a 28-year-old rebel wearing a bandolier of bullets , told a Reuters reporter at the front . 
As the onslaught began , rebels leapt behind sand dunes to fire back . 
After a few minutes they gave up , jumped into their pick-up trucks and sped off back toward Bin Jawad . 
Reports that some Nawfaliyah residents fought alongside government troops were an ominous sign for world powers hoping to end Gaddafi 's rule without a descent into all-out civil war . 
In western Libya , rebels and forces loyal to Gaddafi both claimed control over parts of Misrata , Libya 's third city , which has been besieged by government forces for more than a month . 
State television said thousands of people were taking part in a march in support of Gaddafi in Misrata , which it said had been `` cleansed of armed terrorist gangs . '' 
It was the third time the channel said Misrata had been recaptured from rebels . 
A rebel spokesman called Sami said Gaddafi 's forces had tried to enter the town from the east . 
`` Fighting is still taking place now . 
Random bombardment is continuing , '' he told Reuters by telephone from the city . 
`` The humanitarian situation is catastrophic . 
There is a shortage of food and medicine . 
The hospital is no longer able to deal with the situation . '' 
Aid agencies are increasingly worried about a lack of food and medicines , especially in towns such as Misrata where a siege by Gaddafi 's forces deprives them of access . 
`` It is difficult to even get water in from wells outside the town because of the positions of the forces , '' said Abdulrahman , a resident of Zintan in the west , cut off by pro-Gaddafi forces . 
The U.N. refugee agency said it had reports of thousands of families living in makeshift shelters cut off from assistance . 
Protection of civilians remains the most urgent goal of the air strikes , and British Prime Minister David Cameron accused Gaddafi 's supporters of `` murderous attacks '' on Misrata . 
A series of powerful explosions rocked Tripoli on Tuesday and state television said several targets in the Libyan capital had come under attack in rare daytime strikes . 
The Pentagon said 115 strike sorties had been flown against Gaddafi 's forces in the last 24 hours , and 22 Tomahawk cruise missiles had been fired . 
The United States is scaling back to a `` supporting role '' to let NATO take full command of the air campaign from U.S. forces on Wednesday , but air strikes by U.S. , French and British planes remain key to smashing Gaddafi 's armor . 
Obama told NBC that military pressure and international sanctions had `` greatly weakened '' Gaddafi , adding : `` He does not have control over most of Libya at this point . '' 
Washington says it has seen no evidence of civilian casualties of the bombardment , but Gaddafi accused Western powers of massacres of Libyan civilians in alliance with rebels who he said were al Qaeda members . 
`` Stop your brutal and unjust attack on our country ... Hundreds of Libyans are being killed because of this bombardment . 
Massacres are being mercilessly committed against the Libyan people , '' he said in a letter to world leaders . 
`` We are a people united behind the leadership of the revolution , facing the terrorism of al Qaeda on the one hand and on the other hand terrorism by NATO , which now directly supports al Qaeda , '' Libya 's official news agency quoted him as saying . 
The rebels deny any al Qaeda links and on Tuesday promised free and fair elections if Gaddafi is forced from power . 
Admiral James Stavridis , head of U.S. European Command , told the U.S. Senate that intelligence on the rebel forces had shown ` flickers ' of al Qaeda or Hezbollah presence , but no `` detail sufficient to say there is a significant al Qaeda presence . '' 
Clinton met the opposition Libyan National Council envoy Mahmoud Jebril before the London talks . 
After the conference , she said a political resolution could include Gaddafi leaving the country , and noted that a U.N. special envoy would visit Tripoli soon to explore that option and urge Gaddafi to implement a real ceasefire . 
`` As you know there is a lot of reaching out that is occurring , a lot of conversations that are going on , '' she said . 
`` He will have to make a decision and that decision , so far as we 're aware , has not yet been made . '' 
Obama once again ruled out sending ground troops to Libya or directly toppling Gaddafi militarily . 
`` To be blunt , we went down that road in Iraq , '' Obama said in a televised address before the conference . 
However , the United States and France both said they could consider arming the rebels . 
`` I 'm not ruling it in , I 'm not ruling it out , '' Obama told NBC . 
Washington argues that this possibility is covered by the U.N. resolution , but even its allies disagree . 
`` I remind you it is not part of the U.N. resolution , which France sticks to , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters , `` but we are ready to discuss it with our partners . '' 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Here is what they say above in the artical . 
`` Russia criticized the Western intervention that has turned the tide in the conflict , saying it amounted to taking sides in a civil war and breached the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution '' . 
Nato is trying to protect the rebels from getting massacred . 
Nato is destorying the Airplanes , Tanks , and heavy artillery . 
It comes down to Nato trying to make it a fair fight . 
All Russia is afraid of is that once the rebels make Gaddafi leave Libya or they remove him from prower , that Russia wo n't be apart of the winning team an all that comes with saving Arab lives . 
It will get them good feeling among the Arab League . 
Can someome tell me how Gaddafi is spelled . 
I spell it `` Gaddafi '' . 
I have also seem it spelled `` Kad '' dafy '' Which is the correct spelling for the Libyan Tyrant . 
@SportsCar39 : Sorry about the meds comment the other day . 
I 've seen his name spelled 3 or 4 different ways . 
The most common variation seems to be Kaddafi . 
I like Al KaDaffy myself . 
The Russians rate right down there with Kaddafi in my estimation but they make a point . 
Innocent civilians were protected about day three and a DMZ or free fire zone would have protected civilians from both factions . 
Providing close air support for the rebels and attacking Libya 's armor and troops all the way back to Surt was not part of Resolution 1973 and the UN Charter prohibits outsiders from from interfering in civil wars . 
If Obama and the coalition want KaDaffy gone , they could have done it easily enough and no one else in the world is strong enough to do anything about it . 
Reuters and other media : why do you not quit giving credence to the murderer by quoting his propaganda statements and those of his `` news '' people ? 
We all know what he is and what he stands for . 
Do you really think you are doing something good by quoting his lies ?

2011-03-29,"TUNIS | Tue Mar 29 , 2011 2:20 pm EDT TUNIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyans are suffering dire shortages of food , water and medicine in areas caught up in the six-week-old civil war , above all in cities under siege from Muammar Gaddafi 's forces , residents and aid workers say . 
In Libya 's third largest city Misrata , where forces loyal to leader Muammar Gaddafi and rebels continue to clash , the main hospital has been inundated with wounded and residents say water supplies and electricity have been cut off . 
Libyan officials deny deliberately cutting power and water to the city . 
`` The humanitarian situation is catastrophic . 
There is a shortage of food and medicine . 
The hospital is no longer able to deal with the situation , '' Sami , a rebel spokesman , said by telephone . 
`` We call for urgent help to protect civilians and improve the humanitarian situation . '' 
Aid agencies , based in the rebel-held east , were able to bring in supplies via Misrata 's Mediterranean port last week but it is uncertain if they can deliver more because control over the port has seesawed between rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces . 
`` We are very concerned -LRB- about Misrata -RRB- , '' said Eman Moankar , a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross operations in eastern Libya . 
`` The consequences of this fighting is a worry for us . '' 
In Zintan , resident Abdulrahman also spoke of shortages as pro-Gaddafi forces remain outside the western Libyan town . 
`` It is difficult to even get water in from wells outside the town because of the positions of the forces , '' he said . 
Aid is coming into rebel-held eastern town of Benghazi but with the security situation limiting humanitarian access further west , U.N. aid agencies say they are reviewing conditions and hope to determine the next steps in coming days . 
`` We are managing to send some supplies in already with the Libyan Red Crescent , of course -LRB- it 's -RRB- only reaching some parts of the country , '' Melissa Fleming of the U.N. refugee agency said . 
`` Of course cities under siege or Gaddafi control are not being reached . '' 
She said the UNHCR had reports of a lot of internal displacement , with thousands of families living in makeshift shelters cut off from any kind of assistance . 
The U.N. World Food Programme said it was concerned about food shortages in the country . 
`` Libya depends on food imports , '' said spokeswoman Reem Nada , speaking from the Libyan-Tunisian border . 
`` Supplies are being cut off , stocks are depleting . '' 
The World Health Organization , present at the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , has propositioned drugs and medical equipment there . 
`` As soon as we have access to Libya , as other U.N. agencies , we will help in providing these drugs to centers and hospitals , '' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said . 
In the capital Tripoli , Gaddafi 's main power base , residents are also facing tough conditions . 
Prices have soared , basic items such as milk and cooking gas have grown scarce , and people must spend hours queuing as the war hits daily life . 
`` Tripoli is suffering , '' a resident , who did not want to be identified , said by phone . 
`` This is the life in Tripoli . 
It 's getting worse every day . '' 
Shop shelves have fast emptied and gas canisters as well as electric hot plates to warm coffee and tea without using gas have become scarce . 
`` Most of the products have now disappeared , children 's milk , for example , '' he said . 
As residents have rushed to stock up for what international observers say could be weeks or months of war , some have hoarded supplies , resulting in steep price hikes . 
`` Most of the commodities like oil , the basic needs , prices are increasing , '' the resident said . 
`` For example , we used to buy one can of oil for cars , it used to cost 1.25 dinars , now it costs almost five dinars . 
When you come to cooking oil , it 's also double the price . '' 
`` If you want to buy it you have to go early , maybe you will find it , maybe you wo n't . 
People are very frightened so they store these things in their house , and some they store and sell for double the prices . '' 
As is typical in an economy of shortage , especially in a country under international embargo , Libyans must spend hours in line to obtain basic goods . 
Adding to the difficulties are shorter store hours than usual . 
`` There are very big queues in the banks and sometimes they do n't have currency . 
So they have queues in the banks , queues in the gas stations , queues in the shops , '' the resident said . 
Libyan national television has said little about the hardships of current daily life , showing mainly pro-Gaddafi rallies and events for many hours of its broadcast day . 
Shokri Ghanem , the chairman of Libya 's National Oil Corporation , said on Tuesday oil output had `` dramatically declined '' and that there was a petrol shortage . 
`` There is a crisis because of what is happening in Libya . 
I hope there will be a solution soon , '' he said on state TV . 
`` Many oil fields have halted because the foreign work force left the country . 
Many refineries have also stopped producing including Brega . 
It 's difficult to return to normal in a short period . 
That needs time . '' 
The Internet is not working in Tripoli , but government-controlled newspapers are still being printed . 
`` Most people are not concerned with this , they are concerned with their living conditions , '' the Tripoli resident said .

Full Article Rebels push west before Libya crisis talks NAWFALIYAH\/MISRATA , Libya | Tue Mar 29 , 2011 12:20 am IST NAWFALIYAH\/MISRATA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels advanced west towards the birthplace of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Monday , firing mortars and heavy machineguns in sporadic clashes with loyalist forces . 
Emboldened by Western-led air strikes against Gaddafi 's troops , the rebels took the town of Nawfaliyah and moved towards Sirte , Gaddafi 's home town and an important military base , in the sixth week of an uprising against his 41-year rule . 
As the rebels pressed forward in the east , Gaddafi 's troops were patrolling an area near the center of Misrata after shelling the previously rebel-controlled western city for days . 
The government in Tripoli said it had `` liberated '' Misrata from rebels and declared a ceasefire there . 
Diplomatic activity accelerated on the eve of a 35-nation meeting in London on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in the oil-producing North African country . 
Italy proposed a deal including a ceasefire , exile for Gaddafi and dialogue between rebels and tribal leaders . 
The rebel leadership ruled out compromise with Gaddafi 's followers . 
`` We have had a vision from the very beginning and the main ingredient of this vision is the downfall of the Gaddafi regime , '' spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
Qatar became the first Arab country to recognize the rebels as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people . 
Libyan state television called the move `` blatant interference '' . 
Russia criticised the Western intervention that has turned the tide in the conflict , saying it amounted to taking sides in a civil war and breached the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution . 
The French and British leaders called for supporters of Gaddafi to abandon him and asked Libyans opposing him to join a political process to pave the way for his departure . 
`` Gaddafi must go immediately , '' President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister David Cameron said in a joint statement . 
`` We call on all his supporters to drop him before it is too late . '' 
In the nine days since the start of the Western-led bombing , the motley volunteer force of rebels has pressed half-way along the coast from its stronghold of Benghazi towards the capital Tripoli and regained control of most major oil terminals in the OPEC member state . 
A U.S. Treasury Department official said the rebels could sell Libyan crude without being subject to U.S. sanctions if they conducted the transactions outside the National Oil Corporation and other entities in Gaddafi 's administration subject to sanctions . 
With its finances under pressure , the rebel leadership said it hopes to restart oil exports within a week . 
Some energy traders said that , sanctions aside , they could not touch Libyan oil because of shipping and legal risks . 
On Monday the rebels met sporadic resistance as they continued their advance in convoys of pick-up trucks with machineguns mounted on them . 
Just west of sandy , barren Nawfaliyah , bursts of sustained machinegun fire and the whoosh of several rockets could be heard , and plumes of black smoke rose ahead . 
`` Those are from our guns , '' said Faisal Bozgaia , 28 , a hospital worker turned rebel fighter , pointing to the smoke . 
Rebels said occasional ambushes by Gaddafi forces had pushed them back but that they later regained their positions . 
`` We are advancing one , two kilometres at a time , '' rebel Khalif Ali , 22 , said in the town of Harawah , west of Nawfaliyah . 
But the rapid advance is stretching rebel supply lines . 
`` We have a serious problem with petrol , '' said a volunteer fighter waiting to fill up in the oil town of Ras Lanuf . 
Reuters correspondent Michael Georgy , reporting from Sirte to the west , said he saw police and military but no sign of fighting . 
Soldiers were manning checkpoints and green Libyan flags flapped in the wind . 
Militiamen fired AK-47 rifles defiantly into the air . 
`` If they come to Sirte , we will defend our city , '' said Osama bin Nafaa , 32 , a policeman . 
In Misrata , Gaddafi soldiers manned checkpoints and took up position on rooftops . 
Some housefronts were smashed , smoke was rising from several areas and gunfire rang out constantly across the city . 
Several civilians approached a group of journalists , some of them woman and children waving green flags . 
`` Civilians are happy , '' said an army official who declined to be named . 
`` Everything you are hearing is a lie . 
The function of our army is to save the people and to protect the leader . 
We can not kill our own people . '' 
A rebel spokesman in another western town , Zintan , said forces loyal to Gaddafi had bombarded the town with rockets early on Monday , Al Jazeera reported . 
Western-led air strikes began on March 19 , two days after the U.N. Security Council authorised `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . 
But from the outset , the mission has faced questions about its scope and aims , including the extent to which it will actively back the rebel side and whether it might target Gaddafi himself . 
The start of allied bombings proved a turning point for the rebels who were hemmed into Benghazi at the time . 
Russia , which abstained in the U.N. vote , said Western attacks on Gaddafi 's forces amounted to taking sides . 
`` We consider that intervention by the coalition in what is essentially an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference . 
NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the BBC : `` We are there to protect civilians -- no more , no less . '' 
France , which dropped the first bombs of the campaign nine days ago , said the coalition was strictly complying with U.N. terms . 
It said its planes struck a command center south of Tripoli belonging to Gaddafi 's forces on Sunday and Monday . 
The Defense Ministry in London said British Tornado aircraft destroyed Libyan government ammunition bunkers in the Sabha area of Libya 's southern desert in the early hours of Monday . 
`` He -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- is still capable ... of inflicting further great bloodshed on the people of his own country . 
So we must maintain our efforts absolutely in line with international law , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague told BBC television . 
On Sunday , NATO agreed to take full command of military operations in Libya after a week of heated negotiations . 
The United States , which led the initial phase , had sought to scale back its role in another Muslim country after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
An alliance spokeswoman said on Monday the transition would take a couple of days . 
Libya accused NATO of `` terrorising '' and killing its people as part of a global plot to humiliate and weaken it . 
The government says the Western-led air attacks have killed more than 100 civilians , a charge denied by the coalition which says it is protecting civilians from Gaddafi 's forces and targeting only military sites to enforce a no-fly zone .

2011-03-30,"By the CNN Wire Staff Dramatic losses for Libyan rebels NEW : President Obama does not rule out the option of arming rebel fighters Opposition fighters retreat from Bin Jawad , regroup in Ras Lanuf Libyan government says military and civilian locations were bombed in Tripoli Libyan forces pound Misrata , a witness with the opposition says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi went on the attack Tuesday , pushing opposition fighters back to the outskirts of a key oil town , rebels said . 
Also Tuesday , world diplomats met in London to discuss the future of the North African nation . 
Opposition fighters in Bin Jawad battled Gadhafi forces and came under a hail of artillery and rocket attacks , a rebel source said . 
CNN saw rebel fighters streaming back out of the city , beating what looked to be a hasty retreat . 
One said the barrage was too much for the opposition to withstand , and that Gadhafi loyalists had infiltrated Bin Jawad . 
Rebel forces regrouped in the nearby city of Ras Lanuf , a key oil town that they said they seized on Sunday . 
They came under heavy fire on the western edge of that city , said the rebels , who responded in kind , firing back with whatever weapons were available . 
Tuesday 's fighting marked a reversal of the momentum of the opposition , which until recently had faced relatively little resistance in its westward march . 
Planning Gadhafi 's exit from Libya Witness : ` Utter carnage ' in Misrata Elsewhere in Libya , three loud explosions were heard in Tripoli . 
The blasts came within about a 20-minute span and were the first time since the uprising began that such blasts were heard during daylight in the Libyan capitol . 
On state television , a bulletin attributed to a `` military source '' said that military and civilian locations were bombed in Tripoli `` by the crusader colonial aggression . '' 
It was not immediately clear where the explosions actually took place . 
To the east , Libyan forces continued to pound parts of the city of Misrata Tuesday , with tanks firing mortar shells and troops using heavy artillery in an effort to retake control of the city , a witness told CNN . 
Coalition planes circled overhead but did not strike the tanks , he said . 
The day after Gadhafi 's regime tried to convince journalists that it was in control of Misrata by taking them on a trip to part of the city -- but not allowing them into the city center -- his troops were killing and wounding civilians and evicting thousands of people from their homes , the witness told CNN . 
`` The carnage and the destruction and the human suffering from both the evictions and ... terrorizing the city -- it 's beyond imagination , '' said the witness , an opposition councilman in Misrata , in western Libya . 
`` It 's incredible . '' 
CNN could not independently verify the witness ' descriptions . 
Fierce battles on the ground raged in Libya as diplomats from around the world met in London to decide next steps . 
More than 40 foreign ministers and representatives attended the Tuesday conference , including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping . 
`` The purpose of this conference is to broaden and deepen the coalition effort , '' said British Foreign Secretary William Hague . 
`` We all want to see that cease-fire . 
We all want to see Gadhafi go . 
Those things are clear . 
But once we have that cease-fire , we have something to work with . '' 
Gadhafi has showed no sign of letting up his effort to crush the rebellion , which seeks an end to his nearly 42 years in power . 
Organizers of the conference said it will look for ways to strengthen the U.N. Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that created a no-fly zone above Libya and mandated the protection of civilians . 
It will also search for urgent ways to get humanitarian aid to war-torn cities like Misrata . 
Opposition fighters have credited coalition airstrikes with helping them advance in their rebellion , but say more are needed . 
The witness in Misrata on Tuesday pleaded for coalition forces to strike Gadhafi 's forces in that city to `` save Misrata from a massacre . '' 
Off the coast of Misrata , U.S. military planes fired at three Libyan boats , destroying one and damaging the other two , military officials said in a statement Tuesday . 
The Libyan ships were targeted because of reports that they were firing indiscriminately at merchant vessels in the port of Misrata on Monday , the statement said . 
Libyan state TV had a banner Tuesday saying , `` Civilian and military locations in Misrata , Tripoli , Zaltin , Mazda and al-Watiyaare being bombed by the crusaders and colonial enemies . '' 
The central group representing the opposition in Libya and working to plan a new government if Gadhafi were to fall issued a statement Tuesday describing its `` vision of a democratic Libya . '' 
`` We have learned from the struggles of our past during the dark days of dictatorship that there is no alternative to building a free and democratic society and ensuring the supremacy of international humanitarian law and human rights declarations , '' the statement from the Interim National Council said . 
The group , representing numerous areas throughout Libya , has been meeting in Benghazi . 
In the statement , the council vowed to draft a constitution , guarantee key rights to every Libyan citizen , respect freedom of expression and establish `` a state that draws strength from our strong religious beliefs in peace , truth , justice , and equality . '' 
Much of the statement focused on promises to build a better economy that would eradicate poverty . 
About a third of Libyans live at or below the national poverty line . 
The declaration makes no reference to religious freedom . 
Mahmoud Shammam , a spokesman for the council , said the future government would try members of the Gadhafi regime , not `` hang people in the street . '' 
`` We are going to establish law and order , '' he said in London . 
`` We are not going to take revenge on the streets of Tripoli and Benghazi . '' 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of the council Tuesday at the meeting , part of a U.S. effort to expand ties with rebel leaders fighting to oust Gadhafi . 
It was the second meeting in less than two weeks between Clinton and the Libyan Interim National Council 's Mahmoud Jabril , a former head of Libya 's economic planning council . 
Clinton warned that military action against Gadhafi would continue until he `` ceases his attacks on civilians , pulls his troops back from places they have forcibly entered , and allows key services and humanitarian assistance to reach all Libyans . '' 
President Barack Obama gave interviews to all three major U.S. television networks Tuesday , in which he made it clear he would be open to arming the rebel fighters . 
`` I 'm not ruling it out , but I 'm also not ruling it in , '' Obama told NBC in one of the separate interviews he gave the day after a nationally televised speech on the Libya situation . 
`` I think it 's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could , '' Obama told ABC . 
`` We 're looking at all our options at this point . '' 
The United States will also send a liaison to Benghazi to open up a more direct line of communication with members of the opposition , a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday . 
The official did not say when . 
The U.S. government has spent about $ 550 million on the Libya effort , the Pentagon said Tuesday , adding that about 60 % of that went for munitions . 
Another $ 40 million is expected to be spent over the next three weeks . 
After that , costs are expected to be about $ 40 million per month , said Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kesler .

2011-03-30,"By the CNN Wire Staff CIA operating in Libya , in contact with opposition , source says Libyan foreign minister quits , U.K. says Opposition says it is carrying out `` tactical withdrawal '' Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- CIA operatives are providing intelligence from Libya , where opposition forces are on the run and the defiant government suffered the embarrassing defection of its foreign minister Wednesday . 
The NATO-led coalition , which is enforcing a no-fly zone and protecting civilians from the intense fighting , got no help from the weather in its ongoing efforts to protect the fragile opposition movement . 
`` The weather conditions did not allow close combat support by aircraft in the last couple of days , '' said Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers , chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . 
Moammar Gadhafi 's government , for its part , kept up the war of words . 
State-run Libyan TV late Wednesday quoted a military source as saying a `` civilian location was shelled tonight in the city of Tripoli by the colonizing crusader aggression . '' 
U.S. military switches Libya strategy ` Flickers ' of al-Qaeda in Libya Amid debate on whether the allies will arm the retreating and undertrained rebels , a U.S. intelligence source told CNN the CIA is in the country to increase the `` military and political understanding '' of the situation . 
`` Yes , we are gathering intel firsthand and we are in contact with some opposition entities , '' said the source . 
The White House refused to comment on a Reuters report that President Barack Obama has signed a secret order authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel troops . 
`` I will reiterate what the president said yesterday -- no decision has been made about providing arms to the opposition or to any group in Libya , '' said White House press secretary Jay Carney in a statement . 
`` We 're not ruling it out or ruling it in . 
We 're assessing and reviewing options for all types of assistance that we could provide to the Libyan people , and have consulted directly with the opposition and our international partners about these matters . '' 
According to the Reuters report , Obama signed the covert aid order , or `` finding , '' within the past few weeks . 
Such findings are required for the CIA to conduct secret operations , the report said . 
A U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly could not confirm the finding , but noted when there are crises like this , `` you look at all instruments of national power . '' 
In early March , a U.S. official told CNN `` the intelligence community is aggressively pursuing information on the ground '' in Libya . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons that he has not ruled out arming the Libyan opposition , but added that Britain has not made the decision to do so . 
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provided classified briefings to House and Senate members who asked whether the United States intended to arm the rebels , participants told CNN . 
Clinton and Gates made clear that no decision had been made , and Congress members from both parties said they believed it would be a bad idea , according to participants . 
Regarding the committing of U.S. forces to the U.N.-backed operation , the White House has said Obama acted within his authority under the War Powers Act . 
It notes that the president and other officials consulted congressional leaders several times in the run-up to the March 19 deployment of U.S. forces to the U.N.-authorized Libya mission . 
Clinton told members of Congress the administration acted within the requirements of the War Powers Act and needed no authorization for further decisions on the mission , lawmakers said . 
The opposition got a boost Wednesday with news that Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa willingly traveled to London and told the government there that he has resigned , the United Kingdom Foreign Office said . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman , who has been reporting from Libya for several weeks , said that Koussa 's departure is a significant blow , but not a critical loss to the regime . 
World leaders map out future for Libya The players in Odyssey Dawn Ahmed : ` I 'm not afraid of Gadhafi ' Will U.S. arm Libya 's rebels ? 
The department provided no other details on the surprise move . 
CNN 's Nic Robertson , who previously met with Koussa , said the former head of intelligence once was a stalwart defender of the government . 
The Senate 's Rogers called Moussa 's defection `` huge news . '' 
Libya 's opposition said its fighters are executing a `` tactical withdrawal '' from a swath of territory they once controlled , a move that comes as Gadhafi 's forces relentlessly pound them . 
Col. Ahmed Bani , speaking at a news conference in the opposition capital of Benghazi on Wednesday , said his forces are being outgunned by the superior military power of loyalists , spared the wrath of coalition airstrikes . 
They have been pushed eastward over the last two days after CNN reported on Sunday that rebels took Brega , Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad and reached a town just east of Sirte . 
Rebel forces have now lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the Brega area , Bani said . 
Ajdabiya , which is east of Brega , will be prepared as a `` defense point '' if the withdrawal continues farther east , he said . 
CNN 's Wedeman said the rebels continue to have no effective command and control . 
Bani called on the international community to supply opposition fighters with better and more powerful weapons to hold off the Gadhafi forces . 
He said the opposition was open to foreign troops training rebel fighters . 
Bani asked for tanks , heavy artillery and communications and logistics equipment . 
The rebels have been demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year rule in Libya , but they have been facing `` sustained attacks in the face of the coalition bombing '' in Misrata , Ras Lanuf , and Bin Jawad , Robertson reported . 
In an address to the House of Commons in London on Wednesday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague said that `` regime forces have intensified their attacks , driving back opposition forces from ground they had taken in recent days . '' 
He cited the violence in the western town of Misrata . 
`` Misrata also came under heavy attack yesterday , with further loss of civilian life , including children , from mortars , sniper fire and attacks on all sides from regime tanks and personnel carriers , '' Hague said . 
In the outskirts of Ajdabiya -- which was recently taken over by opposition forces -- Gadhafi 's regime planted several dozen land mines , Human Rights Watch said in a statement Wednesday . 
`` Given the pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area , the mines were clearly laid while government forces were in Ajdabiya , '' the group said . 
Human Rights Watch also said 370 people are missing in the eastern part of the country , with some suspected to be in government custody . 
That list includes rebel fighters and civilians , including doctors , the group said .

2011-03-30,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan rebels man a checkpoint in Uqayla , 20 kilometres east of the town of Ras Lanuf , Libya . 
British and American leaders are openly considering arming the Libyan rebels The rebels have suffered military setbacks this week The rebels would likely need training to use advanced weaponry An al Qaeda and Hezbollah presence among the rebels is a concern -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- European and American leaders weighed the pros and cons of arming Libya 's rebels Wednesday -- a possibility made more urgent by a series of new military setbacks for forces seeking to topple strongman Moammar Gadhafi . 
Government forces have been pushing from Bin Jawad to Ras Lanuf , a critical eastern oil town that the opposition seized on Sunday . 
Gadhafi 's military has also launched escalated strikes in the western town of Misrata . 
The new offensive was launched in the wake of an international arms embargo and air strike campaign designed to establish a no-fly zone and provide humanitarian relief for civilians threatened by the Libyan military . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons Wednesday that the United Nations Security Council mandate `` allows all necessary measures to protect civilians and populated areas -LRB- and -RRB- this would not necessarily rule out provision of assistance to those protecting civilians in certain circumstances . '' 
`` As I 've said before , we do not rule it out but we have not taken the decision to do so , '' he said . 
U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday he is also open to the possibility of arming rebel fighters . 
`` I 'm not ruling it out , but I 'm also not ruling it in , '' he told NBC . 
In a separate interview with ABC , Obama said that `` if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could . 
... We 're looking at all our options at this point . '' 
One significant problem , however , is the need to train opposition forces on how to use advanced weaponry . 
`` The notion of the gang that could n't shoot straight might be lived out , '' retired Maj. Gen. James `` Spider '' Marks told CNN Tuesday night . 
`` There must be some degree of training associated with arming this force , '' said Marks , a former commanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center . 
`` However , some weapons systems , clearly they can get a handle on and they can use immediately . 
It 's the more lethal weapon systems that would require training , and I do n't think there 's time to do that . '' 
Another problem : a possible al Qaeda and Hezbollah presence within Libya 's rebel movement . 
U.S. intelligence has detected evidence of `` flickers '' of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements among the rebels , according to Adm. James Stavridis , the U.S. NATO commander . 
Stavridis stressed Tuesday , however , that such a presence appears to be minimal . 
`` The intelligence that I 'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I 'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi , '' Stavridis told a congressional committee . 
Stavridis 's comments come the same day that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with leaders of Libya 's opposition in London . 
A senior counterterrorism official , unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record , backed up Stavridis ' assessment , downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition . 
There is probably `` a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda '' in Libya among the rebels , `` but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates , '' the official said . 
Al Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years . 
`` It 's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition , '' the official said , but `` the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya . '' 
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that the rebel leaders meeting with Clinton `` made clear what their principles are . '' 
`` We believe that -LRB- their principles are -RRB- meritorious , '' Carney said .

2011-03-30,"By the CNN Wire Staff Mother of alleged rape victim ` angry ' The are no longer afraid to condemn Gadhafi They say the regime is still holding al-Obeidy An investigation continues in the case Tobruk , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Aysha Ahmed and Attique Saleh lived in silence for more than four decades under the ironfisted rule of Moammar Gadhafi . 
Not after they watched their daughter manhandled and dragged away from a Tripoli hotel . 
Eman al-Obeidy 's parents told CNN Tuesday they are no longer afraid to publicly condemn the Libyan strongman , an act that would have been unthinkable just weeks ago . 
If Gadhafi were to face Ahmed now , she would slap him , she told CNN Tuesday . 
Al-Obeidy burst into the hotel housing international journalists in Tripoli Saturday and told them she had been raped by 15 militia men . 
Cameras captured the drama as al-Obeidy , sobbing and screaming , wanted the world to know the brutality of Gadhafi 's regime . 
Woman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces Marriage for woman allegedly raped The Libyan government said al-Obeidy has been freed and that a criminal case is underway . 
The men accused of raping al-Obeidy have filed counter-charges for slander , Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Tuesday . 
But Ahmed contradicted the government , saying the government was still detaining her daughter , in an interview in the eastern city of Tobruk . 
She said she wanted Gadhafi to air footage of al-Obeidy as proof of her safety . 
Ahmed said she can not forgive the grave injustice her daughter has suffered . 
She said the family has even received phone calls offering bribes to reject their daughter 's claims and to tell their daughter to change her story . 
But they stand by her . 
They believe that Gadhafi 's regime is trying to discredit her as a woman who has been raped and -- as some people in conservative Muslim societies believe -- therefore dishonored . 
An in-absentia engagement ceremony held at a mosque in Tobruk Monday night proves that al-Obeidy 's family and tribe stand by her , Ahmed said . 
She described her daughter , 29 , as a kind , caring woman who wanted to be a journalist . 
She chose to study law instead when she realized there was no freedom of the press in her homeland . 
The government first portrayed al-Obeidy as mentally ill and a prostitute . 
It has since changed its story , saying she is sane and therefore able to withstand legal proceedings . 
She also harbored a deep love of languages , particularly Italian and French , Ahmed said . 
As a young girl , she looked out over the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean and called on the oil tankers to carry her to France . 
A government spokesman said Sunday that al-Obeidy had been released and was with her family . 
Moussa Ibrahim said then that al-Obeidy and her family were asked if they wanted to be interviewed by `` one or two , preferably female , reporters to verify that she 's fine , she 's healthy , she 's free with her family . '' 
He refused to take further questions on the issue , repeatedly stating that Libyan society is `` very conservative . '' 
A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy 's sister 's house Monday , but were blocked by security forces . 
The sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN , and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel . 
Ahmed said she was also concerned for the safety of her other daughter . 
Al-Obeidy stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning . 
Her face was bruised . 
So were her legs . 
She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh . 
Speaking in English , she said had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . 
Though her injuries appeared consistent with what she said , CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story . 
`` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . 
`` My honor was violated by them . '' 
Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles . 
Government officials tried to stifle her , but she persisted . 
Security forces moved to subdue her , and even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . 
Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head . 
One government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt . 
Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment . 
Some journalists were beaten and kicked . 
CNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair . 
As security forces subdued the screaming woman and dragged her away , al-Obeidy warned , `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it . ''

2011-03-30,"Does al Qaeda have some Libyan missiles ? 
By Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister , CNN These surface-to-air missile were left at an abandoned Libyan air force base in the dissident-held city ofTobruk in eastern Libya on February 24 . 
Chad president claims North African affiliate has stolen some SAMs No concrete evidence yet of this But al Qaeda known to have enough funds for weapons black market -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The pilots hardly had time to react . 
Two streaks of light shot past their plane as it climbed into the skies above Mombasa in Kenya . 
Fortunately for the hundreds of tourists on board , the two SA-7 surface-to-air missiles -LRB- SAMs -RRB- fired by terrorists from a hillside close to the airport missed their target . 
Minutes later and thousands of feet below , more than a dozen people were killed in a bomb attack on an Israeli-owned hotel , the second part of a coordinated attack carried out by al Qaeda in November 2002 . 
It remains the only record of al Qaeda firing SAMs on a passenger jet . 
But if the president of Chad is right , the terrorist group may just have acquired another batch . 
President Idriss Deby has told the magazine Jeune Afrique -LRB- Young Africa -RRB- that al Qaeda 's North African affiliate -- Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- -- has taken advantage of unrest in Libya to seize SAMs from military stockpiles in rebel-held areas . 
He claimed that the missiles had already been `` exfiltrated '' by the AQIM from Libya and taken to the group 's sanctuaries in the Tnr region of north and northwestern Niger . 
`` It 's a very serious situation , '' he added . 
`` AQIM is on the way to becoming a veritable army , the best equipped in the region . '' 
` Flickers ' of al-Qaeda in Libya U.S. military switches Libya strategy Anderson : Gadhafi opposition badly armed Deby said he was `` 100 % sure '' of the information , but U.S. military officials have not publicly weighed in on the claim . 
When asked about the reports during testimony before Congress Tuesday , Adm. James Stavridis , the NATO supreme allied commander in Europe , said he would respond in closed session . 
There are certainly plenty of SAMs in Libya . 
Video and photographs have shown rebel fighters posing with shoulder-fired surface to air missiles including SA-7s , the same type fired in Kenya . 
The SA-7 is a 1960s-era Soviet-made missile , later distributed to insurgents fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan by the CIA in order to disguise their true origin . 
But analysts doubt that AQIM has obtained such missiles . 
Deby offered no concrete evidence -- in public at least -- to back up his claims . 
He may also have an interest in playing up the al Qaeda threat in his own backyard . 
Counterterrorism analysts say that Deby did not add to his credibility when he said there was some truth to Moammar Gadhafi 's assertion that al Qaeda was orchestrating the Libyan rebellion , a claim for which no evidence has surfaced . 
Stavridis said in his testimony that only `` flickers '' of al Qaeda activity had been detected in eastern Libya . 
Given relatively high rates of Islamist radicalization in eastern Libya in recent years , it is possible that al Qaeda sympathizers in rebel ranks could have transferred weapons to AQIM . 
But it seems unlikely because the rebels ' overwhelming motivation is to topple the Gadhafi regime . 
A more plausible scenario sees AQIM buying missiles on the very substantial black market in weapons in Africa . 
According to Andrew Lebovich , a researcher at the New America Foundation who closely tracks AQIM , the organization 's significant revenues from kidnapping , drug smuggling and human trafficking mean that it has the money to buy SAMs . 
`` If , and it 's a big if , AQIM really did get hold of surface to air missiles and transport them all the way down to Niger , their main rationale would likely be to use them to defend against helicopter raids on their camps by French and other special forces teams in the area . '' 
AQIM appears to have already acquired some anti-aircraft weapons . 
Geoff Porter , an expert on AQIM , wrote in the February edition of CTC Sentinel , published by West Point 's Combating Terrorism Center , that AQIM has used its rising revenues to purchase DSHK -LRB- Dushka -RRB- .50 caliber anti-aircraft machine guns on the black market , possibly from West Africa . 
AQIM has been traditionally weak in Libya , according to Noman Benotman , a former Libyan jihadist who is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation , a UK-based counterterrorism think tank . 
The group 's leadership is mainly Algerian , and its foot soldiers are being increasingly drawn from the Sahel region of Mali , Niger and Mauritania . 
But there are signs that its horizons are broadening . 
According to a recent briefing paper on Libya co-authored by Benotman , up to 40 Libyans have joined the group in the last two or three years . 
And in 2009 , Saif al Islam Gadhafi , one of the Libyan leader 's sons , told CNN 's Nic Robertson that several Libyans had joined AQIM 's ranks in Algeria and Mali . 
According to Benotman , AQIM decided to start infiltrating Libya after the fall of the Tunisian regime in January , after years of avoiding the country because of Gadhafi 's intimidating security apparatus . 
He wrote that `` in early January 2011 , two Libyan AQIM members left their bases in northern Mali and traveled via southern Algeria into Libya . 
Arriving in Ghat , a remote desert city in Libya 's extreme south-west on 15 January , they were involved in a shootout with Libyan security forces , killing one policeman , before being killed themselves . 
This is AQIM 's first known armed operation in Libya . '' 
CNN has not been able to independently verify the incident . 
Last week Sheikh Abu Musab Wadud , the head of AQIM , reacted to Western airstrikes by issuing a video statement denouncing the intervention as a `` modern crusade '' and promising to work to remove it . 
The SA-7 may not be state of the art , but it has proven crudely effective over the years . 
SA-7s were among the weapons deployed by Iraqi insurgents to bring down several U.S. military helicopters in Iraq . 
While most military aircraft are equipped with counter-measures , civilian planes generally are not . 
Western counterterrorism officials say they are concerned about the flood of weapons from Libyan garrisons now in circulation and the difficulty of tracking them . 
Most are not as dangerous as SAMs , but some just may be .

2011-03-30,"WASHINGTON | Wed Mar 30 , 2011 4:54 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Obama administration estimates U.S. military operations in Libya have cost about $ 550 million so far and will cost about $ 40 million a month going forward , a U.S. lawmaker said on Wednesday . 
`` It 's about $ 550 million , '' said Norm Dicks , the senior Democrat on the House defense appropriations subcommittee . 
He spoke to reporters after a closed-door meeting with Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , and Admiral Mike Mullen , the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff . 
The officials estimated the operations would cost another $ 40 million between now and April 18 , and then $ 40 million more a month after that , Dicks said . 
The Pentagon said on Tuesday spending of $ 550 million so far on military operations in Libya would stabilize at $ 40 million per month once U.S. forces are reduced and NATO takes over greater control .

2011-03-30,"WASHINGTON | Wed Mar 30 , 2011 6:16 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama has signed a secret order authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel forces seeking to oust Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , government officials told Reuters on Wednesday . 
Obama signed the order , known as a presidential `` finding '' , within the last two or three weeks , according to government sources familiar with the matter . 
Such findings are a principal form of presidential directive used to authorize secret operations by the Central Intelligence Agency . 
This is a necessary legal step before such action can take place but does not mean that it will . 
As is common practice for this and all administrations , I am not going to comment on intelligence matters , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement . 
`` I will reiterate what the president said yesterday -- no decision has been made about providing arms to the opposition or to any group in Libya . '' 
News that Obama had given the authorization surfaced as the President and other U.S. and allied officials spoke openly about the possibility of sending arms supplies to Gaddafi 's opponents , who are fighting better-equipped government forces . 
The United States is part of a coalition , with NATO members and some Arab states , which is conducting air strikes on Libyan government forces under a U.N. mandate aimed at protecting civilians opposing Gaddafi . 
Interviews by U.S. networks on Tuesday , Obama said the objective was for Gaddafi to `` ultimately step down '' from power . 
He spoke of applying `` steady pressure , not only militarily but also through these other means '' to force Gaddafi out . 
Obama said the U.S. had not ruled out providing military hardware to rebels . 
`` It 's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could . 
We 're looking at all our options at this point , '' he told ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer . 
In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted to reporters that no decision had yet been taken . 
U.S. officials monitoring events in Libya say neither Gaddafi 's forces nor the rebels , who have asked the West for heavy weapons , now appear able to make decisive gains . 
While U.S. and allied airstrikes have seriously damaged Gaddafi 's military forces and disrupted his chain of command , officials say , rebel forces remain disorganized and unable to take full advantage of western military support . 
People familiar with U.S. intelligence procedures said that Presidential covert action `` findings '' are normally crafted to provide broad authorization for a range of potential U.S. government actions to support a particular covert objective . 
In order for specific operations to be carried out under the provisions of such a broad authorization -- for example the delivery of cash or weapons to anti-Gaddafi forces -- the White House also would have to give additional `` permission '' allowing such activities to proceed . 
Former officials say these follow-up authorizations are known in the intelligence world as '' ` Mother may I ' findings . '' 
In 2009 Obama gave a similar authorization for the expansion of covert U.S. counter-terrorism actions by the CIA in Yemen . 
The White House does not normally confirm such orders have been issued . 
Because U.S. and allied intelligence agencies still have many questions about the identities and leadership of anti-Gaddafi forces , any covert U.S. activities are likely to proceed cautiously until more information about the rebels can be collected and analyzed , officials said . 
`` The whole issue on -LRB- providing rebels with -RRB- training and equipment requires knowing who the rebels are , '' said Bruce Riedel , a former senior CIA Middle East expert who has advised the Obama White House . 
Riedel said that helping the rebels to organize themselves and training them how use weapons effectively would be more urgent then shipping them arms . 
Sending in weapons would arguably violate an arms embargo on Libya by the U.N. Security Council imposed on February 26 , although British , U.S. and French officials have suggested there may be a loophole . 
Getting a waiver would require the agreement of all 15 council members , which is unlikely at this stage . 
Diplomats say any countries that decided to arm the rebels would be unlikely to seek formal council approval . 
An article in early March on the website of the Voice of America , the U.S. government 's broadcasting service , speculated on possible secret operations in Libya and defined a covert action as `` any U.S. government effort to change the economic , military , or political situation overseas in a hidden way . '' 
The article , by VOA intelligence correspondent Gary Thomas , said covert action `` can encompass many things , including propaganda , covert funding , electoral manipulation , arming and training insurgents , and even encouraging a coup . '' 
U.S. officials also have said that Saudi Arabia and Qatar , whose leaders despise Gaddafi , have indicated a willingness to supply Libyan rebels with weapons . 
Members of Congress have expressed anxiety about U.S. government activities in Libya . 
Some have recalled that weapons provided by the U.S. and Saudis to mujahedeen fighting Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s later ended up in the hands of anti-American militants . 
There are fears that the same thing could happen in Libya unless the U.S. is sure who it is dealing with . 
The chairman of the House intelligence committee , Rep. Mike Rogers , said on Wednesday he opposed supplying arms to the Libyan rebels fighting Gaddafi `` at this time . '' 
`` We need to understand more about the opposition before I would support passing out guns and advanced weapons to them , '' Rogers said in a statement . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Or maybe his goal is food riots , reduction of large parts of major cities to rubble , and a cart load of dollar bills for a loaf of bread to make a socialist take over easier ... Maybe he 's not just inept , but malevolent . 
Are we arming the next terrorists attack on the US ? 
If I know Al Qaeda fighers are with the Libyan rebels , SURELY Obama knows Al Qaeda fighers are with the Libyan rebels . 
Either Obama is foolish or he has bad intentions for the United States . 
This discussion is now closed . 
We welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication .

2011-03-30,"AJDABIYAH , Libya | Wed Mar 30 , 2011 11:32 am EDT AJDABIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels beat a rapid retreat east on Wednesday , ceding land and a series of oil towns as quickly as they had taken them after Muammar Gaddafi 's forces unleashed rockets and artillery on lightly armed rebel forces . 
Aided by Western air strikes , rebels had made a two-day charge along more than 200 km -LRB- 125 mile -RRB- of barren coast and seized strategic oil terminals . 
They have now retreated , giving up gains to Gaddafi 's better armed troops . 
The failure of the rebels to hold ground and put pressure on Gaddafi , despite more than 10 days of Western-led air strikes , is likely to unsettle the United States , Britain , France and others who want to see the Libyan leader step down . 
Hundreds of rebel pick-ups mounted with machine guns and other vehicles streamed east of Brega with little sign of order , heading toward Ajdabiyah , a town that rebels took five days to retake from Gaddafi even after air strikes were launched . 
`` We are going to Ajdabiyah , '' said rebel fighter Mohamed al-Abreigi . 
`` We will gather there and , God willing , we will head back to Brega today . '' 
Dozens of rebel vehicles gathered at the western gate to Ajdabiyah , a town which lies about 140 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
But rebels did not seem to be regrouping into defensive positions there . 
One man in military fatigues shouted : `` Civilians inside , civilians inside . '' 
When asked what was happening , one rebel said : `` We do n't know . 
They say there may be a group -LRB- from Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- coming from the south . '' 
To the south is open desert . 
Ajdabiyah , battered by the to-and-fro of fighting , stands at the gateway to the rebel held east of Libya . 
It is located on a key junction with one route heading to Benghazi and another northeast to the oil port of Tobruk near the Egyptian border . 
Libyan families were fleeing north to Benghazi as news of the retreat spread . 
The road out of Ajdabiyah was packed with cars carrying families and their belongings . 
Rebels had advanced beyond the coastal town of Bin Jawad , about 525 km -LRB- 330 miles -RRB- east of the capital Tripoli . 
But as they approached Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte , they came up against the Libyan leader 's heavier weaponry . 
`` Gaddafi 's forces have Grad -LRB- rockets -RRB- which have a range of 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- ... If we had Grads we could liberate Libya in a day , '' said rebel fighter Ezzedine Saleh . 
Another fighter , Muftah Mohammed , told Reuters : `` Kalashnikovs , RPGs -LRB- rocket-propelled grenades -RRB- and light rockets -- these are our weapons . '' 
Rebels regularly appeal for better weapons from the West and more air strikes . 
But even some members of the rebel movement have admitted that one of the biggest challenges is keeping discipline in their enthusiastic but inexperienced force . 
Few rebel fighters have much formal military training . 
They have proved keen to race to the front but equally swift to fall back with little sign of order when big guns fire at them . 
Their own weapons offer little to block Gaddafi 's advance . 
`` Where is the French air force ? 
We wo n't be able to get to Sirte except with help from the French air force , '' said rebel Rafa Abbas near Ras Lanuf , moments before aircraft roared overhead . 
A series of loud booms followed . 
A rebel fighter , Ahmed , returning from Ras Lanuf , told Reuters : `` The French planes came and bombed Gaddafi 's forces . '' 
But the apparent aerial attack showed no sign of slowing down Gaddafi 's advance or halting the pace of the rebel retreat . 
Some 10-15 km -LRB- 6-10 miles -RRB- west of Brega , around a dozen rebel fighters stopped by the road and trained their guns south into the Sahara . 
Wisps of smoke could be seen in the distance . 
`` They -LRB- Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- are coming from the desert , '' yelled one fighter . 
Another fired his Kalashnikov rifle in the air to scare away a group of camels . 
There was no sign of the rebels forming any determined defense of the sprawling oil town of Brega . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
The fact is that a substantial number of the rebels will include jihadist agitators -LRB- assuming U.S. intel has not relied entirely on Gaddafi 's claims over the past few years -RRB- who have encouraged , supported , incited and even spearheaded the revolution , and will not be without honor in any new government that the West will have to deal with . 
How does one arrange security and intel with a future government whose security includes Al Qaida or jihadist moles and even open sympathizers ? 
John McCain might want also to consider mission-creep against forces that know how to make strategic retreats , how to ambush , how to cache and deploy heavy arms in and around cities -LRB- and just how much they have cached -RRB- , inaccessible to air strikes , how well motivated G 's forces really are , etc. . 
The U.N. has fashioned a general economic noose for G. , the coalition is striking systematically at his forces ' materiel , and there is no turning back . 
But there is no reason to ramp it up either . 
This is a war of attrition , nothing more , nothing less . 
There has been way too much talking by the coalition diplomats when the Libyan rebels need air power , long range artillery\/rockets , and tanks . 
Are all these US and NATO Politicians and Military general completely STUPID . 
Common sense appears in very short supply . 
A civil war is raging in Libya . 
Gadhafi has a trained military army . 
The rebels have no trained military army . 
WE can knock out all Gadhafi 's air power etc but that still leaves his ground soldiers . 
And UN 1970 resolution is to protect civilians only . 
So how do you stop Gadhafi troops when they enter cities without us killing civilians . 
Answer you need to put `` boots on the ground '' to fight Gadhafi troops and then we have another IRAQ to suck up lives and squander tax dollars . 
And the UN resolution 1970 is ignored . 
Has anyone learned any lessons ... . 
And remember there are 6 or 7 dictators in countries around Libya who crush their people , so will we bomb them also . 
These med-evil countries live by the Sharia Law and have been killing each other for centuries . 
They are not going to stop . 
We should get the hell out , and let them murder one another . 
Once their OIL is gone , we will have NO interest in them .

2011-03-31,"Here 's an excerpt from the op-ed I wrote today in The Washington Post : American statesmen have always experimented with the use of limited military means to support foreign policy interests that are important , and worth engaging American power , but not vital . 
From the Barbary wars -LRB- fought against the Barbary States , which included parts of modern Libya -RRB- to gunboat diplomacy in Asia to the many military interventions over the past few decades -LRB- Grenada , Lebanon , Somalia , the no-fly zone over Iraq , Bosnia , Kosovo -RRB- , the United States has often tried to find ways to use its military yet not engage in all-out war . 
Some were more successful than others , but in all cases , the central task was to find the balance between the goals we sought and the means we were willing to deploy . 
The time we didn t ask questions about the costs and simply escalated the means , we ended up in Vietnam . 
The tendency for a president is to be pushed to achieve a decisive victory , no matter the costs , no matter whether the interests at stake are vital or secondary . 
Presidents want to be leaders of great causes , and the Libyan mission is certainly a good cause . 
But the more grandiose the rhetoric and the goals , the broader the military mission . 
And then the United States takes responsibility for the fate of Libya a country riven with tribes , lacking strong institutions and a civil society , and destroyed by four decades of Gaddafi s madness . 
Do we really want to own this , and largely alone ? 
Is it such a bad idea that others should be involved ? 
Washington is now hoping that a bit more military power will dislodge Gaddafi s regime . 
My fingers are crossed . 
But it would be far more sensible , while hoping for the best , to plan for other likely outcomes ... As I argue in the op-ed , limited interventions might have limited successes , but they can also avoid catastrophic failures . 
President Obama 's reasons for employing U.S. military force in Libya are idealistic at best , if not hopelessly romantic at worst . 
Unfortunately , idealism is not what drives , much less influences significantly , the clashes and movements in relations between and among nation states . 
Foreign policy veterans , and most military leaders know that intuitively , if not explicitly . 
Woodrow Wilson s League of Nations idea following The Great War is a good example of what happens when the ideal conflicts with the real . 
As Americans , we harbor very idealistic notions about wars of rebellion . 
It is part of our own History , mythology , and legends . 
History is grittier than what we wish , and harder than what we would like to remember . 
All civil wars and rebellions are ugly . 
Something President Obama and the rest of us will learn in due course in Libya . 
March 31 , 2011 at 11:35 am | Reply Arabian Spring ? 
President Obama is obviously a man of conscious and the fact that he has refused to sit on his hands in the face of the happenings across Northern Africa and surly now events building in the Middle East demands that the U.S. needs to forge new policy . 
The U.S still being a super power with responsibilities that come with the title , is obligated to lead not only in forming needed new international policies for America but also by example set the bar for all nations of the world to follow . 
Because of our fundamental democratic believes , believes in freedoms , the rule of law , equality , and most importantly truth ; our policy makers now find themselves in a vary difficult position . 
These countries around the globe with their populous demanding change and hopefully desiring to move towards a system similar to our own ; are now forcing us to evaluate our own policies in dealing with dictators that all the nations of the world have had relationships with for decades . 
Its time for the U.S. to begin the process of coming clean or the face the consequences ; that we can no longer continue this business as usual practices with murderous dictators . 
If America and the nations of the civilized world continue trade relations with such dictators we not only promoting but also empower the vary behavior that we deplore . 
The closest thing we have to a globe committee is the United Nations and honestly we all known the dysfunctional qualities of committee rule . 
Getting things done under such constraints are merely impossible , thus the other strong reason why America and currently the Obama administration needs to and has to take on these issues as impossible as they may seem . 
The U.N. mandate 1973 is surly only the beginning of a conversation that all the nations of the world need to begin . 
That if the nations of the world are going to come together in consistent policies that effect the populous of the world now is the time . 
If our policy makers don t lead the way ; we are no better than an individual who buys stolen goods , from a murder . 
March 31 , 2011 at 2:31 pm | Reply Does the U.S. want to own Libya ? 
Of course it does !!! Only a person whose IQ is less than 10 would believe otherwise !!! What a ridiculous question ! 
March 31 , 2011 at 4:41 pm | Reply This question seems to confirm the views of the Libyan people lately , that the U.S. is after their oil . 
Otherwise the Americans ca n't be bothered to engage themselves in this millitary foray . 
No , the U.S. does n't necessarily want to own Libya , but it wants to show the world , who has more to say . 
March 31 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Reply Of course the U.S. wants to own Libya as anybody with half a brain would surmise . 
Why do you think that Obama 's setting up a `` no-fly '' zone and now arming the `` rebels '' for ? 
After all , Libya is an oil rich country like Iraq and we invaded Iraq and now own it for that very same reason . 
March 31 , 2011 at 7:36 pm | Reply ahhh , thats all i needed to know to understand the US involvement ... i was wondering why the US even cared but now it all makes sense once again May 7 , 2012 at 7:09 am | This is a three layered chess game for the removal of a dictator . 
If I may explain the first layer of the game is a least cost intervention meaning no blood and very modest treasure used . 
Second layer is the CIA they will goose things along to the conclusion and the objective we need . 
Third layer offer buisness and jobs for all of those 20 year olds that just want the freedom to get jobs that pay well . 
This is known as a piece of the action . 
Remember if our emotions control our moves we will loose . 
Everybody thought Regan was nuts two but it worked . 
There was no real operational star wars program . 
I am going with the President on this one he is precise when he wants to get something done . 
April 1 , 2011 at 1:41 am | Reply I feel it serves the U.S. well in keeping some portion of the globe destabilized , but in the end , this game is going on since far too long for anybody 's comfort , American Middle East policies have indirectly contributed to the economic down slide of that nation . 
it would be in everybody 's interest that America stops playing the global cop , else it might find itself pitted against the whole world in manner of the Nazis during the penultimate stages of the WW II . 
April 1 , 2011 at 2:12 am | Reply US only wants to liberate Libya with democracy , as it always has . 
Saying this in case Americans have forgotten their heritage ... April 2 , 2011 at 1:28 am | Reply It grieves me to see mindless cynicism and downright non-comprehension in the comments here . 
The question is not whether we want to `` own '' Libya , but whether we want to `` take ownership '' as the current business jargon goes of the whole Libyan situation . 
I think the administration has answered that with a resounding `` no '' . 
Afghanistan and Iraq show what happens when we involve ourselves in primitive countries with tribal loyalties and no history of democratic institutions . 
When you remove a dictator in a country of this nature , all you do is create a power vacuum . 
If you leave , you will just leave it to some warlord to take over again . 
If you stay and try to do `` country building '' with military means -LRB- and the military are the wrong ones to do this in any case -RRB- you just unite the people against you as the foreign occupier . 
No fly zone to prevent a Rwanda style massacre of innocent civilians ? 
Ok , but let the other Arab states do that . 
No , we do n't want to `` own '' the Libya mess . 
That 's for the Libyans to figure out .

2011-03-31,"Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of the Libyan mission , said Thursday that NATO was still enforcing the arms embargo . 
As NATO takes over Libya mission , it says it wo n't provide arms to rebels NATO commander : `` We have very strict rules of engagement '' A Vatican envoy says up to 40 civilians were killed as a result of NATO operations Brussels , Belgium -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On NATO 's first day of command in Libya on Thursday , the alliance reaffirmed its commitment to enforcing the arms embargo and not providing weapons to the rebels . 
`` The Alliance has the assets in place to conduct its tasks under Operation Unified Protector -- the arms embargo , no-fly zone and actions to protect civilians and civilian centers . 
In line with the mandate of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 , NATO 's focus is on protecting civilians and civilian-populated areas against the threat of attack , '' NATO said in a statement , adding that the `` operational tempo '' of the mission had not changed because of the handover . 
NATO officials say the handover has been smooth and seamless . 
On his first day as commander of the Libyan mission , Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard fielded questions on the possibility that civilians had been hurt as a result of NATO operations . 
A Vatican envoy reported that as many as 40 civilians had been killed . 
A closer look at Bashar al-Assad `` It is a news report and I appreciate the source of this report , but it is worth noting that I take every one of those issues seriously , '' said Bouchard from the mission 's operational command in Naples , Italy . 
`` We are very careful in the prosecution of any of the possible targets that we have . 
We have very strict rules of engagement provided to us and we are operating within the legal mandate of our United Nations mandate , '' he added . 
Russian diplomatic officials , meanwhile , warned against a `` creative '' interpretation of the U.N. resolution and hinted it was beginning to regret its decision to abstain during the U.N. vote . 
Russia , as one of the Security Council 's permanent members , has veto power . 
But NATO officials insist they are employing the strictest interpretation of the resolution . 
`` The alliance has nothing to hide -- not to Russia and not to you , '' Adm. Giampaolo Di Paola , chairman of NATO 's Military Committee , told a press briefing at NATO headquarters . 
"
2011-03-31,"Libyan rebels wave the flag of the rebellion as they gather near Brega March 31 . 
CIA operatives are inside Libya , sources tell CNN There is a debate over whether the U.S. should arm rebel forces Key issue : Can they be trained in time to use the weapons ? 
Also , would the armed rebels then support NATO 's mission ? 
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States has seen what happens when it arms rebel forces against brutal regimes -- and how it can backfire . 
Libya could end up in that same category . 
Here are some frequently asked questions on the situation in Libya , what the options are and the debate over arming the rebels . 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization , of which the United States is a member , is working to take down Col. Moammar Gadhafi 's brutal regime , which has reportedly killed thousands of Libyans since a revolt broke out over the past month . 
Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Thursday that Gadhafi still wants to take back the city of Benghazi , the rebel stronghold , and that the dictator `` will kill as many -LRB- people -RRB- as he must to crush the rebellion . '' 
France was the first nation to step in to enforce the no-fly zone directive . 
French fighter jets struck military targets in eastern Libya on March 19 . 
Britain also stepped into the conflict by providing logistical support . 
Shortly after , U.S. fighter jets used air strikes to take out targets while warships launched missiles into the northern African nation . 
The United States has since handed over the brunt of the mission to NATO , but it is still the major force behind the effort . 
But administration officials , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , insist that `` there will be no boots on the ground , '' or sending in U.S. troops to support the rebels . 
By taking down Gadhafi , the country stands a chance at developing a democracy . 
In essence , Gadhafi needs to go and prevent a humanitarian and refugee crisis that could help destabilize the entire region . 
It 's a point that has been made clear from President Barack Obama , his administration and leaders around the world . 
Who are the opposition and what do they want ? 
Simply put , Libyans who are outraged at the atrocities that the Gadhafi regime has inflicted on its people including massive human rights violations . 
But if the rebels are successful , there are concerns that such a fractured group could form an actual government -- or work with the U.S. And perhaps that is why Central Intelligence Agency operatives are inside Libya , a U.S. intelligence source said , to get firsthand knowledge of who the coalition is working with . 
Will U.S. arm Libya 's rebels ? 
Rumsfeld speaks out on mission in Libya Gates : Obama followed War Powers Act Why it 's a bad idea Training Libyan rebels against Gadhafi 's forces comes down to education . 
Can the rogue group learn to use sophisticated machinery and the tactics to employ it in time -- and with a clear directive ? 
`` This is a nightmare trying to train the Libyans . 
I tried to do it many years ago , said Robert Baer , a former CIA operative . 
`` These people are very difficult to manage . '' 
Baer added that the type of discipline needed `` takes a very , very long time , especially when you 're dealing with a foreign force and you have to have Arabic speakers on the ground . 
It 's tough . '' 
So is it practical to arm the rebels fast enough ? 
`` Well , the notion of the gang that could n't shoot straight might be lived out , '' Retired Army Brigadier Gen. James Marks said . 
`` Absolutely , there must be some degree of training that is associated with arming this force . 
However , some weapons systems clearly they can get a handle on and they can use immediately . '' 
`` We simply do n't have control over the rebels . 
They do n't have to follow our orders , '' Baer said . 
`` They take our money and weapons and go shoot who they want . '' 
Why it 's a good idea Paul Wolfowitz , a deputy secretary of defense under former President George W. Bush , said it 's vital the U.S. supports arming the rebels . 
`` I think we should be doing everything we can to support the opposition , '' he said . 
`` It 's true , we do n't know what the opposition would be like when they take over , but there are actually some promising signs . '' 
Another Bush official said that arming rebels is vital to the overall mission . 
`` Somebody has got to be on the ground doing the hard work of taking the territory , '' said former National Security adviser Stephen Hadley . 
`` And if it 's not going to be U.S. troops -- and nobody really wants that -- then we 're going to have to deal with the Libyan people and try to empower them to fight and win their own freedom . 
And giving them weapons has to be part of that . '' 
Will history come back to haunt us ? 
The Soviet Union fought a brutal war in Afghanistan in the 1980s . 
The U.S. , strictly opposed to the move by the `` evil empire , '' as former President Ronald Reagan called it , tried to tilt the balance by arming the Afghan mujahadeen against the Soviets . 
Though in the short term it helped the mujahadeen drive the Soviets out , some of those same weapons were used years later against the U.S. during the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in the country 's history . 
Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Michigan , said in a statement that he has deep concerns over such past efforts . 
`` We do n't have to look very far back in history to find examples of the unintended consequences of passing out advanced weapons to a group of fighters we did n't know as well as we should have , '' said Rogers , , who is chairman of of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . 
`` We need to be very careful before rushing into a decision that could come back to haunt us . '' 
But former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that sometimes arming opposition forces can work . 
`` We did a good job in Afghanistan -LRB- arming -RRB- the Northern Alliance and some of their militias in the south and they were very successful in driving al Qaeda out of Afghanistan and of changing the regime from the Taliban to the Afghan government , '' Rumsfield said . 
According to Adm. James Stavrides , the U.S. NATO commander , U.S. intelligence has detected evidence of `` flickers '' of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements among the rebels -- though the influence appears to be minimal . 
Senior officials and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney seemed to downplay that notion , saying that the values being expressed by the rebels are `` antithetical to the purposes and ideals set forth by terrorist organizations . '' 
Rumsfeld , one of the key figure in taking the U.S. to war in Iraq , said there are concerns about terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and Hezbollah influencing the rebels . 
He said that there are still a great deal of questions as to who is involved in the rebel group and therefore `` you have to be careful about arming rebels . '' 
Rep. Dan Burton , R-Indiana , asked Thursday : `` How many of these citizen-soldiers fighting against Gadhafi -- how many are people who are tied into terrorist organizations in Iraq and Afghanistan and do we know who they are ? 
Do we have any idea ? '' 
He added that it 's `` a heck of a situation when we go into a conflict and we do n't know who we are supporting . '' 
What 's it going to cost ? 
While NATO has taken over the military operations in Libya , the U.S. still has committed itself to support , which could result in billions of dollars in aid going forward . 
Meanwhile in Washington , the battle in Congress is over cutting spending , reducing the deficit and passing a 2011 budget . 
There is no doubt that critics on both sides of the aisle will grill administration officials on why the U.S. should add money the country does n't have -- and whether the operation could stretch the already overstretched U.S. military .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : It is Friday , April 1st -- no foolin ' -- and you 're watching CNN Student News ! 
I 'm Carl Azuz . 
First up today , we 're heading to the North African nation of Libya . 
AZUZ : But a top ranking official from that country is heading out ! 
Libya 's foreign minister turned up in London yesterday . 
His name is Moussa Koussa , and he told the government in London that he had resigned his position in Libya . 
Koussa is someone who , just a month ago , was defending the Libyan government . 
British officials say Koussa 's resignation is a serious problem for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and his authority in Libya . 
U.S. military commanders have said that Libya is not a `` boots on the ground '' operation , meaning they are n't planning to send ground troops into the country . 
We 've heard President Obama say that , too . 
But the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency -- the CIA -- is on the ground in Libya . 
A source told CNN that operatives from the agency are gathering intelligence and sometimes connecting with rebel fighters . 
NATO -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- has taken command of the coalition military operation in Libya . 
Now , when we say that NATO has taken command , so what ? 
What does that mean ? 
Well , NATO is an organization that 's made up of 28 countries from North America and Europe . 
The United States is a key member . 
So are the United Kingdom , France , Germany . 
NATO does n't have its own unique troops . 
NATO forces are made up of troops from those member countries . 
So U.S. forces , British forces , French forces : They 're still very much a part of this operation in Libya . 
AZUZ : In Japan , officials are worried about the levels of radiation in the ocean water near the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . 
Officials say those levels are skyrocketing , and there 's no clear idea of what 's causing the spike or how to stop it . 
Samples taken on Wednesday show that the levels of one radioactive isotope in the water are more than 4,000 times higher than the limit that 's approved by regulators . 
But one official said the seawater radiation does n't pose a risk to people eating seafood , at least , not yet . 
MEGAN CLOHERTY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : In response to rising gas prices , President Obama outlined a plan to expand offshore oil and natural gas drilling to provide short-term relief and other steps that would allow the nation to transition to cleaner and cheaper sources of energy . 
U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : We consume about 25 percent of the world 's oil . 
We only have two percent of the reserves . 
CLOHERTY : Obama said the demands of global oil consumption and the instability in the oil market leave America with no other choice but to act now to establish its energy independence . 
OBAMA : We 've got to discover and produce cleaner renewable sources of energy that also produce less carbon pollution , which is threatening our climate . 
And we 've got to do it quickly . 
CLOHERTY : The president said that despite fears raised by the nuclear plant emergency in Japan , he is not abandoning nuclear power as an alternative to oil . 
While Obama 's plan to increase offshore drilling may upset the environmental lobby , his energy secretary emphasized the drilling is a short-term fix . 
U.S. SECRETARY OF ENERGY STEVEN CHU : Ultimately , what this is about is diversifying our supply of energy . 
CLOHERTY : Republican leaders charged the president 's program wo n't do much to make things better for Americans anytime soon . 
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL , -LRB- R -RRB- MINORITY LEADER : The president 's target is decades from now , but Americans should be able to expect action now . 
CLOHERTY : While the president 's efforts to reduce oil prices bring motorists relief at the gas pump , the administration plans to raise fuel efficiency standards for car makers this fall , which could result in an increase in sticker prices .

TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : What 's the word for when something on the internet spreads very quickly ? 
AZUZ : The video about bullying that 13-year-old Alye Pollack posted on YouTube went viral . 
Within two weeks , nearly 50,000 people had seen it . 
Alye sat in front of the camera and held up pieces of paper introducing herself and sharing some of the names bullies have called her . 
There 's been a lot of talk recently about the internet giving bullies more ways to pick on people . 
Alye turned the tables , going online to speak out against it . 
And she says her video is making an impact . 
ALYE POLLACK , MADE ANTI-BULLYING VIDEO : I 've had a lot of people come up to me and say , `` Now I know not to say bad things . 
I think before I do say something . '' 
And that 's just amazing , because people are actually being affected by my video . 
EUNICE YOON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT , HONG KONG : It 's 4:00 in the afternoon , rush hour . 
Most people in China are starting to go home from work . 
But for the people of Qingyanliu village , their day has just started . 
This tiny village near the manufacturing hub of Ewu sets its clock by the online habits of China 's shoppers . 
Until five years ago , this place was a rural backwater . 
Now , its 10,000 residents generate $ 120 million in sales thanks to a popular e-retailing site called Taobao . 
E-commerce chief Liu Wengao says the village has grown five-fold , and is now a base for entrepreneurs looking to make it rich off online stores . 
LIU WENGAO , LOCAL E-COMMERCE CHIEF -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` There are hundreds of millions of people in China and tens of millions on the internet , '' he says . 
`` We will never run out of customers . '' 
YOON : When China 's shoppers place their orders on Taobao , Chin Yao Moon 's merchants fill them at shops like this . 
Liu Jin has inventory of his own . 
But if he does n't have what his customers want , someone else in this town will . 
LIU JIN , ONLINE MERCHANT -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` We are over here picking up what we need to fulfill their order , '' Liu explains . 
YOON : Once his basket is full , he is off to start packing the evening shipments . 
The entire village is alive with vendors like Liu . 
Express trucks come and go seemingly nonstop into the wee hours . 
Thousands of parcels are stacked daily , emerging from underground warehouses . 
These basements have a mind-boggling array of goods , everything from the practical to the strange . 
The government keeps rents in these buildings low , so people like Lin Saila can get started investing only in a room and a computer . 
Today , she received over 3,000 orders . 
LIN SAILA , STORE MANAGER -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` Every year , there 's a lot of growth , '' she says . 
`` Each year is better than the last . '' 
YOON : Nearly all of this stuff is made right here in Ewu , so it 's convenient and it 's cheap to get . 
So , what vendors do is that they take orders online , and then they package everything up and ship it right across the country . 
Liu has been to Beijing and Shanghai , but now this farmer 's son can stay closer to home . 
LIU -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` I make money , '' he says . 
`` It gives me more freedom . '' 
YOON : The express truck is about to leave . 
Liu hustles to make sure his customers get what they want on time . 
LIU -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` Every day is this hectic , '' he says . 
`` We 'll be back at it tomorrow in the town the Internet built . '' 
YOON : Eunice Yoon , CNN , Qingyanliu , China . 
AZUZ : Weird is how a lot of you describe yesterday 's `` TVs watching you '' story , when information about what people watch is shared with advertisers . 
Sam does n't see a problem with it , writing `` it 's important for advertisers to locate a demographic to help them with their research . '' 
Sadam can see how it would be better if ads were more relevant , but feels this is a major invasion of privacy . 
`` Random companies seeing what we watch on TV is not their business ; it 's ours . '' 
Levi states `` it 's not like they are watching you get dressed or anything ; they 're just trying to do business . 
I think they have every right to . '' 
From Brenna : `` It allows you to watch ads for things you 're interested in , instead of things you do n't even care about . '' 
But Natalie writes `` the idea is n't foolproof in any way . 
If it 's some sort of setting that can be turned off , though , it could help us greatly . '' 
And Kaylee , who says our privacy is being violated , adds it should either stop , or the companies could ask customers if they 're comfortable being monitored . 
Great comments , y ' all ! 
AZUZ : Some guys need to work up a lot of nerve to ask someone to prom . 
Jason here did n't seem to have that problem . 
He wrote a song , roped his buddies into being a back-up band , got the whole class in on the idea . 
And all for one simple question . 
Sure , he put her on the spot , but you know she said yes . 
We 're just glad someone was recording the whole thing and posted it on YouTube . 
AZUZ : That way we can prom-ote Jason 's impressive proposal . 
You might think a video like that would prom-pt us to make some jokes . 
But we prom-ise not to . 
We do promise that we 'll be back on Monday . 
Hope you have a great weekend .

2011-03-31,"March 31 , 2011 | By Fawaz A. Gerges , Special to CNN Almost two weeks of intense bombings and the enforcement of a no-fly zone in Libya by Western-led forces have neither broken the will of Col. Moammar Gadhafi nor subdued his followers . 
Instead , the past couple of weeks have proved that Libya is much more divided than the world had feared . 
The major challenge facing the opposition now will be in reaching out to tribal supporters of Gadhafi -- and skeptics and bystanders -- to allay their fears . 
This kind of reconciliation will be the only means to avert a protracted , costly civil war that could allow Gadhafi to regain some degree of control . 
The coalition 's airstrikes have indeed severely degraded Gadhafi 's military infrastructure and paved the way for the rebels to recapture , at least for a time , a number of coastal communities and important oil installations , including Ras Lanuf , Brega and Bin Jawad . 
But loyalist forces pushed them out in recent days -LRB- Ajdabiya and Uqayla still appear to be in rebel hands at the moment -RRB- . 
According to Pentagon spokesman Vice Adm. Bill Gortney , any military gains made by the rebels will be tenuous because of their lack of organizational structure . 
Two high-level Libyan officials , Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa and Ali Abdussalam el-Treki , did defect this week . 
Despite this , Gadhafi 's entourage is fiercely defending the cities and towns recaptured from the rebels . 
That they continue to persevere in the face of international force should not come as a surprise , given the tribal structure of Libyan society and Gadhafi 's manipulation and co-opting of tribal divisions and allies . 
What is even more alarming is that Gadhafi 's forces have managed to insert themselves into urban areas across Libya . 
To defeat these loyalists will necessitate boots on the ground fighting a long , bloody , guerrilla-style war . 
Civilians would undoubtedly become targets . 
Even if the Western-led coalition arms and trains the rebels and dislodges Gadhafi from power , the morning after will likely be messy , costly and even less certain . 
Libya appears to be sliding into a prolonged conflict with no light at the end of the tunnel .

2011-03-31,"By Alexis Crow , Special to CNN Arming rebel force carries with it clear moral predicament in facilitating the act of killing U.S. has reputation for propping up unsavory dictators while arming opposition groups The longer conflict continues , the longer the country can be used as launch-pad for opportunists Dr. Alexis Crow is Research Fellow at Chatham House 's International Security Programme . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the Western coalition considers the option of whether or not to arm the rebel opposition in Libya , one word immediately comes to mind : `` Blowback . '' 
Coined by author Chalmers Johnson , it is now often referred to specifically as the unintended consequence of the U.S. decision to arm the non-Afghan Arab fighters -- or ` mujahideen ' -- in their fight against the Soviets . 
Little did the CIA know that the very same fighters would one day form the backbone of al Qaeda . 
Yet in contrast to `` Charlie Wilson 's War '' in Afghanistan , and indeed other CIA missions throughout the Cold War -- particularly in Latin America -- the current decision is being debated in the open . 
On whether or not to arm the rebels , President Obama announced : `` I 'm not ruling it out but I 'm also not ruling it in . '' 
Why such a cautious tone ? 
Primarily , arming a rebel force carries with it a clear moral predicament in facilitating the act of killing . 
This is something to be carefully debated by all of the Libya coalition partners . 
Furthermore , since the start of the Cold War , the U.S. has garnered quite a tarnished reputation for propping up unsavory dictators on the one hand , and giving arms and materiel to opposition groups , on the other . 
Notwithstanding , since the start of the intervention , the U.S. and its allies have had to seriously consider the option of arming the Libyan opposition , in the event that the conflict becomes a stalemate between a loosely-organized rebel group and Gadhafi 's well-equipped loyalist forces . 
But the resounding questions are : Who are the rebels , and do they represent a coherent democratic alternative to Gadhafi 's regime ? 
Or , will arming the opposition fuel a tribal conflict ? 
A case could be made that Gadhafi 's autocratic rule is comparable to that of Marshal Tito in the Balkans : Only a dictator could hold different tribes or nationalities in place in one political entity . 
When Gadhafi came to power by military force in 1969 , he united three separate territories , divided by the former king Idriss I -- hence , the argument goes , a representative democracy could n't hold them together again . 
However , there are reports of a considerable population of the Warfalla and Tarhuna tribes -- those loyal to the Gadhafi regime -- residing in the east of the country , as well as many Benghazis living in the west . 
If they form some sort of united front against Gadhafi and in the name of democracy -- spearheaded by the rebels -- there may be hope for change . 
Yet how quickly could a new government become stabilized -- especially in a region rocked by Islamist revolt ? 
How long might that government stay in power ? 
With hindsight , what national interest might justify supplying arms to rebels in a volatile and unstable region ? 
The longer an armed conflict continues , the longer the country can be used as a launch-pad for opportunists seeking to wield non-state power , and accordingly , the more time afforded for such groups to raid arms depots or caches potentially provided by the West . 
After all , the Kalashnikovs and M-16s used during the Soviet war in Afghanistan have remained serviceable for decades -- and are even employed against ISAF forces today . 
Looking back to CIA 's support of the mujahideen , `` Charlie Wilson 's War '' was somehow justified by the national interest of containing the Soviets -- by ensuring their military defeat in south Asia , we might have hastened their ideological defeat in Europe . 
Yet with hindsight , what national interest might justify supplying arms to rebels in a volatile and unstable region , populated by spin-off groups from the al Qaeda franchise , ready to capitalize on a potential civil war ? 
In what way can this befit any national security interest of a coalition partner ? 
Therefore , even more than the moral dilemma of giving arms to groups , the option at hand may pose a greater strategic dilemma , with unintended consequences for decades to come . 
These questions merit serious consideration in the coming days -- before any option is `` ruled in . '' 
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alexis Crow .

2011-03-31,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan foreign minister flees country NEW : Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa is old and sick and had permission to leave , Libya claims The International Criminal Court does not consider him a suspect at the moment Koussa is the highest-ranking defector from the Gadhafi government so far Experts : He probably has information about the Lockerbie bombing , Libya 's arms program London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The surprise arrival Wednesday of a tall , gray-haired man at a small airport outside of London raised eyebrows -- and it also raised hopes of a breakthrough on many fronts . 
The man on the plane was Moussa Koussa , Libya 's foreign minister and former intelligence chief , and he was defecting from the regime of Moammar Gadhafi , the highest-ranking official yet to do so . 
Koussa was a stalwart defender of the government as recently as a month ago . 
But in recent weeks , his demeanor has visibly changed . 
At one recent media briefing , he kept his head down as he read a statement and left early . 
He did not tell the Libyan government he was planning to quit before he arrived in Britain , Libyan government spokesman Mousa Ibrahim said Thursday . 
Hoekstra : What may be next in Libya Libyan opposition speaks out on tactics Anderson : Gadhafi opposition badly armed But Ibrahim downplayed the defection itself , saying Moussa was an old man in poor health who had not been able to handle the pressure of his job . 
`` We gave him permission to leave , '' Ibrahim said , less than 24 hours after Libyan government denials that Koussa had defected , and insisted he was coming back . 
The British Foreign Office announced late Wednesday that Koussa had resigned and come willingly to the United Kingdom . 
There 's debate about whether his departure from Tripoli will weaken Gadhafi , with some saying it will be a signal to other doubters around Libya 's leader that it 's time to jump ship . 
`` It could potentially have a devastating impact on morale within the Gadhafi regime , '' said Noman Benotman , a former Libyan militant now with the Quilliam Foundation , a counter-extremism think tank . 
`` Strategically , this move attacks the center of gravity within the regime , '' Benotman said . 
`` I hope other senior figures within the regime now realize that they too need to be part of the solution and not remain part of the problem . '' 
But others say that Koussa was never in Gadhafi 's innermost circle and that his departure is a significant blow but not a critical loss to the regime . 
Whether his defection precipitates further crumbling of the government in Tripoli or not , Koussa may be able to shed light on Libya 's exact role in events like the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 and the killing of a British policewoman in 1984 . 
`` Let 's remember , Moussa Koussa is the single most important Libyan official who was responsible for the intelligence service , the planning and execution of -LRB- the bombing of -RRB- Pan Am 103 , '' CNN national security contributor Frances Fragos Townsend said . 
He was also a key player in Libya 's decision to give up its weapons of mass destruction program , said Townsend , who was a homeland security adviser in the George W. Bush administration . 
`` He was the single individual who had to approve or disapprove my going forward to meet with Gadhafi . 
And so he really does have secrets to tell , '' she said , adding that Libya 's leader confided in Moussa and relied on him . 
British intelligence will be questioning him and passing information to Americans , she anticipated . 
And she 's certain he arranged everything carefully before he boarded the plane for Britain . 
`` His finances , his immunity from prosecution and his freedom from extradition process -- he would have worked that all before he left , '' she said . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday that Koussa had not been offered any immunity . 
On Thursday , Hague reiterated calls for senior members of the Gadhafi government to step down . 
Koussa 's defection provides evidence `` that Gadhafi 's regime ... is fragmented , under pressure and crumbling from within , '' he said . 
Koussa is voluntarily speaking with officials in the UK , he said . 
The International Criminal Court , which has opened an unprecedented investigation into possible crimes against humanity during the ongoing Libya civil war , said Thursday that Koussa is not a suspect . 
`` We have no individuals under investigation , and we will see where the evidence leads us , '' ICC prosecution spokeswoman Florence Olara said . 
She said she did not know whether Koussa had been in touch with prosecutors seeking immunity or offering testimony . 
But Scottish prosecutors want to question him about the Lockerbie bombing , the government there said Thursday . 
Scottish officials said they have informed the Foreign Office in London that they want to speak to him . 
`` The investigation into the Lockerbie bombing remains open and we will pursue all relevant lines of inquiry , '' the government said in a statement . 
The only person convicted in connection with the bombing , Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi , was freed from prison in Scotland in 2009 and sent home to Libya on the grounds that he had terminal cancer .

2011-03-31,"By Amar C. Bakshi , CNN Chris Strohm over at the National Journal lays out five reasons to arm Libya s rebels , and another five reasons not to . 
Five reasons for arming the rebels include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- it may level the playing field ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the UN Resolution authorizes all necessary measures ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- it may stymie al-Qaeda ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- regional stability is at stake ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- other countries can provide the arms . 
Five reasons against arming the rebels include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- we don t know who they are ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- it may not be needed ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- it may not be legal ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- it may stir up a hornet s nest ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- it may cost too much . 
Below I ve highlighted a few takes from people on both sides of the debate , and their reasons . 
Fareed argues that arming the opposition is a low-cost policy with a high rate of success , necessary for leveling the playing field against Gadhafi . 
Over the past five decades , the U.S. has had very mixed results when it has intervened , by air or land , in other people 's wars . 
But it has done pretty well when it has helped one side of the struggle . 
Arming rebels in Afghanistan , Central America and Africa has proved to be a relatively low-cost policy with high rates of success . 
Giving arms , food , logistical help , intelligence and other such tools to the Libyan opposition would boost its strength and give it staying power . 
Once Gadhafi realizes that he is up against an endless supply of arms and ammunition , he will surely recalibrate his decisions . 
Fareed further argues that a genuine rebel army could pressure Gadhafi toward some kind of exit : Now that we have tied ourselves to their -LRB- the Libyan rebels -RRB- fate , we certainly need to help them more substantially . 
The arms embargo , which applies equally to Gadhafi and the opposition , will have to be circumvented . 
A genuine rebel army would put further pressure on Gadhafi , who would know that he faced death at its hands , and would push him toward some kind of exit . 
Max Boot adopts a more aggressive stance , saying the U.S. end goal ought to be removing Gadhafi from power , and arming the rebels is a vital step in that direction . 
Given that we already have Western agents on the ground helping them -LRB- the rebels -RRB- , and that Western aircraft are actively bombing Gadhafi s forces to bring about his defeat , it seems disingenuous to claim we are not involved in regime change . 
The only question now is whether that regime change will be swift or protracted . 
I believe it is in our interest to do everything possible to bring about Gadhafi s downfall as rapidly as possible and then to help Libya stabilize itself in the aftermath . 
The lesson Max draws from Afghanistan in the 1980s is : If the U.S. is involved in toppling a regime , whether directly or indirectly , we must not walk away afterwards . 
Otherwise our aid can backfire . 
Now according to Reuters and the New York Times , President Obama has signed a secret finding authorizing the C.I.A. to provide arms and other support to the Libyan rebels , although reportedly debate continues within the administration on whether to actually follow through on arming the rebels : Several weeks ago , President Obama signed a secret finding authorizing the C.I.A. to provide arms and other support to Libyan rebels , American officials said Wednesday . 
But weapons have not yet been shipped into Libya , as Obama administration officials debate the effects of giving them to the rebel groups . 
The presidential finding was first reported by Reuters . 
Blogger Andrew Sullivan is outraged that President Obama may get the U.S. involved in regime change in secret : To say that this is a betrayal of his candidacy and his supporters would be an understatement . 
It makes George Bush 's request for a vote from Congress before committing the US to war in Iraq look like a model of democratic accountability . 
How dare this president commit this country to an open-ended involvement in a foreign country 's civil war - in secret , with no real public debate and then presented as a fait accompli . 
And now we are told there is a debate within the administration over whether to follow through on its preparation and actually arm the rebels . 
How can that be possible ? 
If we are not there for regime change imposed by foreign powers , as the president has insisted , on what grounds is this even being discussed ? 
Andrew further argues that arming the rebels would undermine the Arab Spring : This secret shift to full-on entanglement is also , to my mind , a well-meant but ill-conceived undermining of the Arab Spring . 
Regime change by force of foreign arms is not a democratic revolution ; it is the imposition by foreign powers of their agenda in the service of groups we do not know or understand -- and will never know and never fully understand . 
Bruce Riedel warns of a slippery slope : You can t just give them weapons . 
They need to be organized and disciplined to go from being an armed mob to a force capable of dealing with Gadhafi s troops . 
That means sending trainers and advisers , which means putting boots on the ground . 
Alexis Crow echoes common concerns about the makeup of the rebels : But the resounding questions are : Who are the rebels , and do they represent a coherent democratic alternative to Gadhafi 's regime ? 
Or , will arming the opposition fuel a tribal conflict ? 
And Josh Felter and Brian Fishman warn that arming the rebels could simply fuel a deadly civil war , which could allow for a niche jihadi group to flourish : The more likely scenario than a clean rebel victory , however , is also more dangerous : that either military stalemate or internal divisions among rebel groups will lead to a chaotic civil war in which a small jihadi faction can flourish amid lawless conditions . 
History shows us that even a small band of determined extremists , if well led , armed , and equipped , can wreak havoc and challenge efforts to bring stability and order to a weakened state . 
Algeria suffered a decade of terribly brutal civil war at the hands of extremists such as the Armed Islamic Group and its splinter faction the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat . 
Other examples include the Abu Sayyaf group in the southern Philippines , Jemaah Islamiyah in Indonesia , and Islamist extremist groups that fuel the insurgency in Chechnya . 
And al-Qaida in Iraq still kills on a scale that would be deemed completely unacceptable in any country where the recent past was not so tremendously violent . 
The debate rages on . 
Spencer Ackerman notes that NATO is all over the place on the question of arming the Libyan rebels : The international community does not seem to have resolved the question of whether or not to arm the rebels . 
In Brussels , the alliance s civilian leader firmly backed off that option in an interview with CNN . 
We are not in Libya to arm people , said Anders Fogh Rasmussen , but to protect people . 
That contradicted the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice . 
We ve not , certainly , ruled that out , Rice told ABC s George Stephanopoulos , who said that the U.S. has an important interest in seeing Gadhafi step down . 
President Obama is obviously a man of conscious and the fact that he has refused to sit on his hands in the face of the happenings across Northern Africa and surly now events building in the Middle East demands that the U.S. needs to forge new policy . 
The U.S still being a super power with responsibilities that come with the title , is obligated to lead not only in forming needed new international policies for America but also by example set the bar for all nations of the world to follow . 
Because of our fundamental democratic believes , believes in freedoms , the rule of law , equality , and most importantly truth ; our policy makers now find themselves in a vary difficult position . 
These countries around the globe with their populous demanding change and hopefully desiring to move towards a system similar to our own ; are now forcing us to evaluate our own policies in dealing with dictators that all the nations of the world have had relationships with for decades . 
Its time for the U.S. to begin the process of coming clean or the face the consequences ; that we can no longer continue this business as usual practices with murderous dictators . 
If America and the nations of the civilized world continue trade relations with such dictators we not only promoting but also empower the vary behavior that we deplore . 
The closest thing we have to a globe committee is the United Nations and honestly we all known the dysfunctional qualities of committee rule . 
Getting things done under such constraints are merely impossible , thus the other strong reason why America and currently the Obama administration needs to and has to take on these issues as impossible as they may seem . 
The U.N. mandate 1973 is surly only the beginning of a conversation that all the nations of the world need to begin . 
That if the nations of the world are going to come together in consistent policies that effect the populous of the world now is the time . 
If our policy makers don t lead the way ; we are no better than an individual who buys stolen goods , from a murder . 
March 31 , 2011 at 2:29 pm | Reply It is a pity that the 70 % of the US population whose IQ are below average influence the decisions made by the remaining 30 % whose IQ are over and above the average . 
Is it a problem with democracy ? 
March 31 , 2011 at 11:49 pm | Reply Not that your comment warrants a response , but if the response of the elites is merely to criticize roll your eyes around and offer no meaning full response . 
Then I guess you honestly don t understand how freedom of expression or democracy works . 
April 1 , 2011 at 10:05 am | Wow ! 
It 's difficult to grasp most of your points because your writing is nearly incoherent . 
You seem to suggest that President Obama is correct to take unilateral action on his own without regard to opinions of the US people -LRB- through their elected representatives in Congress -RRB- or the world opinion -LRB- the United Nations -RRB- . 
I suppose you would also support the Obama administration taking any unilateral action it chooses without consulting with anyone . 
That sounds like dictatorship to me . 
April 1 , 2011 at 8:01 am | Reply I do not suggest war or police actions I suggest that removing most favorable trade status from the likes of dictators who don t care to advance the interest of their own people . 
Further those nations that ignore trade embargos be added to the same list . 
April 1 , 2011 at 9:21 am | For the last 40-50 yrs our policy has been to support dictators at the cost of the people of those countries . 
In part this is what helped create al-Qaeda and terrorist mind sets against the then super powers of Russia and USA . 
The government which we the American people fund is directed by corporate American , and other international big bucks powers . 
Their minds sets are protect the Oil , protect their profits protect our energy needs . 
In the case of Libya its Italian , French , and British Oil interest that s being defended and the new Obama Doctrine forced on to him by the recent events in Egypt and across the Arabic countries . 
The revolts by this people were inevitably going to happen you can only suppress truth for a short time in the new information age . 
The promotion of Democracy is currently being forced on U.S. policy makers . 
Lest they be seen as hypocrites and the general populous of Americans the same , So if we the American people truly believe in freedom we need to put our money were are mouths are or quit buying Oil from these dictators . 
April 1 , 2011 at 9:37 am | Reply '' ... democratic believes , believes in freedoms ... '' believes is the key word , exactly ! 
With 676 thousands dollars of debt per family you are very `` free '' comparing with the Lybians those had almost no debts under Gaddafi 's rule April 2 , 2011 at 7:21 pm | Reply The only right thing the U.S. can do is to do nothing at all . 
This country has absolutely no business sticking it 's nose into Libya 's civil war but the right-wing thugs in Washington are adamant on doing so through their own arrogance and self-righteousness . 
No wonder this country 's in the trouble it finds itself ! 
March 31 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Reply Actually , Arab league , France and UK were much more adamant about it than these `` right-wing thugs in Washington '' . 
March 31 , 2011 at 5:50 pm | Reply This policy of do nothing sends a clear message to the dictators and the people of the world that life under their regimes . 
That the Americans are comfortable with the actions of these dictators ; all we care is that they continue to sell us their Oil . 
Americans and the nations of the world will continue to buy your goods so that the dictator can continue to dictate and Americans can t quite grasp why the people of other nations have doubts about the Americans . 
April 1 , 2011 at 10:37 am | Reply Please do n't arm the freedom fighters , they have to succeed on the ground , now they have covert c.i.a. ops , no more should be needed . 
We should start wrapping up our operations by July or sooner . 
In and out and the freedom fighters will respect the U.S. more . 
March 31 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | Reply I ponder at times that our government may actually convince themselves that the general public who actually is aware of our involvement in other countries , is not happening at all ... did I make sense ?????? CIA involvement is and always will be `` covert '' . 
Thus , since we have a `` habit '' of getting involve ... let , s accept the fact that the only solution is to simply go ahead and do the best we can . 
Yes , there are parameters , but the simple solution is in this case is to arm the rebels , get Gaddafi out , and take it from there . 
March 31 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | Reply What the U.S. needs to do is to break it 's `` habit '' of getting involved and overcome it 's arrogance and self-righteousness . 
We have absolutely no right to be there at all !!! March 31 , 2011 at 7:22 pm | Reply Is n't arming the rebels how Afghanistan wound up under Taliban rule ? 
The rebels became the oppressors . 
March 31 , 2011 at 5:15 pm | Reply Obama wants Libyans saved from Gaddafi 's savage forces but does not care two hoots about the Afghans dying violent deaths at the hands of the US troops . 
Is it because he considers the lives of civilians in oil-rich Libya more valuable than those of poor Afghans ? 
April 1 , 2011 at 12:37 am | Reply this is why we going broke . 
given out to much to others you dont see them helping us . 
March 31 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Reply I find it strange that the U.S. sees no qualm to arm the rebels , while the Gaddafi forces get no reinforcement from outside due to arms embargo . 
Even if the rebels were armed with sophisticated weaponry , it is no guarantee that they would beat the government forces . 
On the battlefield artillery does n't always help if one lacks experience and training . 
March 31 , 2011 at 5:47 pm | Reply No followup on March 20 French airstrike and failure of rebel militia to assess , see : BENGHAZI : AIRSTRIKE ASSESSMENT -LRB- EYES ONLY -RRB- You ca n't change horses in the middle of the stream . 
We backed them and should see it through . 
We should n't write them off so quick . 
Democracy takes time and education , and eventually they will get there . 
At this point , anything is better than Gadhafi . 
March 31 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Reply WE HAVE ALWAYS DESERTED OUR ALLIES ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE . 
This is nothing new April 1 , 2011 at 12:58 am | Reply North Korea , Saudi Arabia , Iran , China , Venezuela , Cuba , ... ... ... None of these countries are a democracy either should NATO enforce no fly zones over all of these countries so their citizens can revolt . 
Think about it ... ... We should arm the `` rebels '' with nuclear war heads with triggers set to go off as soon as they are armed ... Problem solved . 
That is the only way to end fighting and blood shed in these backwards countries . 
March 31 , 2011 at 6:43 pm | Reply Your comments prompt me to ponder why American education has incubated so many nuts like you ? 
April 1 , 2011 at 12:08 am | Reply We did n't back anybody . 
We created a no-fly zone to protect civilians from being slaughtered by the thousands . 
Republicans were for it , until Obama did it . 
Arming the rebels is something that should not be taken lightly . 
We armed the Afghan mujahideen in their fight against Soviet occupation . 
Research that , and see what the consequences were . 
We do n't need to make another mistake like that . 
March 31 , 2011 at 7:31 pm | Reply BS we were n't protecting citizens . 
We are engaged in a full scale war , killing people and breaking things April 1 , 2011 at 1:00 am | Reply Arming the rebels may not be the best idea , but it is certainly better than the alternative . 
Just imagine instead of a Civil War in Libya that the headlines were more along the line of a genocide by Gadhafi killing all his protesting citizens . 
The `` No Fly Zone '' however in my opinion is a clear sign of international unification against Gadhafi and for him to be tried for his crimes . 
It also allowed the rebels to be doing as well as they are but I do agree with the `` Obama Doctrine '' that we need only interveen to protect our intrest , it does however seem to me like it allows us to pick and choose our battles which can help us in the future if we 're ever faced with a situation like the one in Libya . 
March 31 , 2011 at 7:59 pm | Reply The so-called `` Obama Doctrine '' will end up doing far more damage than any good . 
Besides , I get sick and tired of hearing all this Western propaganda about pro-Qadaffy forces killing `` civilians '' . 
After all , they 're killing `` rebels '' who are trying to take over Libya . 
Without Western interference , this conflict would have ended by now . 
March 31 , 2011 at 8:18 pm | Reply The constant bombardment of Gadhafi ` s supporters will cause them to bow to the wishes of the coalition . 
A human can not take the noise of exploding shells for more than a month . 
They will kiss arse for some quiet . 
March 31 , 2011 at 8:06 pm | Reply Ai n't that just like a Democrat : Blame Republicans for intervening in other country 's affairs , pass laws so that America ca n't interfere with other country 's affairs , then go right ahead and intervene in other country 's affairs . 
I 'm flat out disgusted with partisan politicians and the mindless morons who vote for them . 
Ai n't that just like a Democrat : use doublespeak to conjure up a rationalization for Libyan involvement -LRB- when no valid reason exists -RRB- , depend on the partisan lemmings to regurgitate it , as if it is Holy and above question , engage in a push-button attack , then turn tail and hand the op over to France . 
What was it the Democrats had against Operation Iraqi Freedom again ? 
March 31 , 2011 at 11:35 pm | Reply The helter-skelter advance and retreat of the Libyan rebels is how Arabs fight when they are not trained by western powers . 
Mostly it 's alot of shouting and bluster , firing off rounds in the general direction and falling back to regroup and find enough courage to advance again . 
One guy who 'd been studying in America came and brought his own rifle which he did not know how to load -LRB- or clean -RRB- . 
Very emotional , not logical . 
Hope the CIA sent Arab speakers because they wo n't listen to you otherwise and translating battlefield tactics and small weapons handling is tedious thru translators . 
Everyone will want to be a general but no one will know how to lead . 
If Obama is too squeamish to get in he needs to take the head off the opposition quickly . 
That means a sniper or close-in assassin to take out Gadhafi and his sons . 
There are people who can do this and its alot cheaper in lives and money than a civil war fought by civilians . 
The Europeans are the ones who use Libyan oil so let them do it . 
March 31 , 2011 at 11:44 pm | Reply April 1 , 2011 at 1:16 am | Reply Not to bring up folks ' dirty laundry but , it was Biden and Obama , among other Democratic leaders and followers , who suggested that Bush should be impeached because he convinced the Congress to grant him war powers . 
Obama got the UN to agree but , that is n't what the Constitution requires . 
We do n't NEED ANY OTHER COUNTRY to declare a war when it 's in our national interest . 
But , we DO NEED THE CONGRESS TO AGREE . 
You 're spending huge amounts of money every time you fire those cruise missles and even the cost of small arms can soar if you do n't have fire discipline on the line -LRB- such as your allies firing weapons in the air for fun -RRB- . 
If they wanted to take the leader of Libya out they had adequate reasons without ANYONE but us agreeing to it . 
When is he going to seek Congressional approval for this escapade ? 
They run the budget and every day of this stupidity cost this nation and YOU your taxes and inflation due to debt . 
Obama is trying to criple the US economically to please his patron , Soros , and he 's losing the fight on spending in Congress . 
He 's hoping by pulling this it works out several advantages for him . 
He wants this exercise so he can appear to be a leader -LRB- about like the Ceasar in Gladiator -RRB- . 
He wants this to force Congress in approve spending -LRB- which always has `` goodies '' for his party buried in them -RRB- . 
He wants this because he 's trying to boost the union dues by trying to create more of a need for union labor .

Gadhafi anounced in November he was going to give the Russian and Chinese companies the contracts and cut out Spain 's Repsol , France s Total , and Italy s Eni , Germany s Winstershall a unit of BASF and OMV of Austria . 
The American companies involved are Occidental Petroleum , and Waha Oil , a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips , Marathon and Hess .

Just like CIA covert operations and the Presidential approval for ` recognizing and assisting the rebels ' , supplying them with weapons is well underway already . 
All part of ` the plan ' , boys and girls . 
The only part of the plan that 's indistinct at this time is how it 's all going to end up ? 
For those ` rebels ' are ` Islamicists ' , Ghaddafi is n't and , as we 're told , Islamicists are a big part of ` world terror ' .

Americans , do you ever learn any history ? 
Or you think that your example set in the 18th century would be true and applicable for everybody else ? 
Let me try to explain myself : there are two types of revolutions and therefore revolts around the world . 
One is caused by intellectuals the other one by plebes . 
So far the revolution by intellectuals occurred only in the US , which led to real changes and improvement on human rights -LRB- i.e. let me remind you , this is why you are celebrating July 4th each year -RRB- . 
The revolution caused and conducted by plebes , on the other hand , is the type that almost all other revolutions throughout the history can be attributed to . 
You want a list ? 
It 's going to be a long one -LRB- but i 'll try to shorten to the key events in the world history -RRB- : French Revolution , Russian Bolshevik Revolution , Islamic Revolution in Persia . 
What do they all have in common ? 
Instead of making the lives of common people better , they ended up in large massacres : the reign of terror in France and thousands guillotined , the persecution of thousands of people in Russia by Lenin and Stalin and camps such as Gulag , the discrimination of killing of Bahais and people from other congregations in Iran . 
One more example needs not to be forgotten is the war Afghanistan between Soviets and Taliban , where you , sweethearts , out of total stupidity and lack of any understanding of the situation , empowered Taliban , which eventually came back to bite you in the arse on 9\/11 . 
So go ahead , support the rebels , bring disorganized plebes and eventually Al-Qaeda to power , but then do n't complain and moan when you have another skyscrapers blown up and get your hands dirty with blood of lots and lots of civilians who will be beheaded because of the refusal to follow the Sharia law just like it happened in in Soviet Union in camps or public executions in Afghanistan . 
P.S. And if you really count on democratic elections there , remember the human psychology first and note the following facts : in the past years in Iran such leaders as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power in an absolutely democratic way in Iran , Hamaz was also elected democratically in Gaza and the most notable example is Hitler , whose party was supported in 30 's by an overwhelming majority .

I would not be surprised if Turkey interfered with effective air campaign . 
We see propaganda shots of Turkish humanitarian evacuations which do not help insurgents in the long term . 
If this stalemate continues , Turkey status as regional power will increase and NATO will be tarnished . 
Because of decisions by consensus there is nothing that can be done about it within NATO structure . 
The way around it is to provide effective ground weapons to insurgents .

2011-03-31,"By the CNN Wire Staff CIA working the ground in Libya ? 
A witness said he fears a `` massacre '' in Misrata A U.S. presidential finding authorizes CIA operations in Libya , a source says White House : Libyan foreign minister 's defection shows pressure is `` having an effect '' Tune in to `` AC360 '' at 10 ET Thursday night for an exclusive interview with The New York Times journalists who were captured , then released by the Libyan regime . 
Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From the halls of Congress to the shell-pocked streets of Libyan cities , intertwined themes rang clear Thursday : Leader Moammar Gadhafi is determined to prevail , and the opposition needs more training and allied air strikes to have a chance . 
`` Gadhafi will `` kill as many -LRB- people -RRB- as he must to crush the rebellion , '' Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee . 
The rebels , who were regrouping after several setbacks , pinned their hopes on more coalition air power , which will likely increase as weather improves . 
`` We want more to bring a speedy end to this , '' Col. Ahmed Omar Bani , an opposition spokesman , told CNN . 
`` A strike is not a strike unless it kills , '' he said . 
Rare view inside Misrata 's war zone Wounded pregnant woman shares story Gadhafi 's son had a U.S. internship Libyan foreign minister flees country CIA operatives have been in Libya working with rebel leaders to try to reverse gains by loyalist forces , a U.S. intelligence source said . 
The United States , insisting it is now fulfilling more of a support role in the coalition , shifted in that direction as NATO took sole command of air operations in Libya . 
The ferocity of this month 's fighting and Gadhafi 's advantage in firepower was clearly evident in Misrata , which has seen snipers , significant casualties and destruction . 
A witness told CNN Thursday there `` is utter madness '' and Gadhafi 's men are going door-to-door evicting and terrorizing people . 
`` I am afraid it will be one big massacre here in Misrata '' if the international forces `` do not do more , '' he said . 
CNN did not identify the witness for security reasons . 
Saddoun El-Misurati , a spokesman for the Libyan opposition in Misrata , described intense fighting and casualties in the city . 
`` We managed to get two shipments , so far , of badly needed medical supplies to the hospitals . 
But obviously we still need more supplies in dealing with the day-to-day casualties and the situation on the ground , '' he said . 
Gadhafi 's military capabilities had been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned air strikes , U.S. officials have said . 
But the dictator 's forces outnumber the rebels by about 10-to-1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , Mullen noted . 
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , also speaking before the House committee , warned that the Libyan rebels still need significant training and assistance . 
`` It 's pretty much a pickup ballgame '' right now , he said . 
Anderson : Gadhafi opposition badly armed Libyan opposition speaks out on tactics U.S. and British officials say no decision has been made about whether to arm the opposition . 
Dianne Feinstein , head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , told CNN 's `` The Situation Room '' she opposes doing that . 
The Democratic senator cited failures of such a move in other conflicts . 
Bani -- asked whether he is open to the idea of ground forces from outside Libya joining the rebels ' effort -- responded that `` all options are open to us . '' 
`` It has been very hard the past few days because the freedom forces have been facing heavy tanks and artillery weapons with very light weapons , '' the spokesman said . 
While some members of the Libyan military reportedly defected to join the opposition , the rebels include many volunteers who have not been trained . 
Over the weekend , CNN reported that rebels had taken al-Brega , Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad , and reached a town just east of Sirte . 
But in the past three days , opposition fighters have been pushed back eastward . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman , reporting Thursday from near al-Brega , said the rebels , armed with light mortars and machine guns , have displayed no strategy in their running battles with loyalist troops . 
Gates reiterated the Obama administration 's promise that no U.S. ground forces will be used in Libya , telling committee members that the rebels had indicated they did n't want such an intervention . 
But the United States does have CIA personnel on the ground . 
A U.S. intelligence source said the CIA is operating in the country to help increase U.S. `` military and political understanding '' of the situation . 
A former counterterrorism official with knowledge of U.S. Libya policy said there is a presidential finding authorizing the CIA to conduct operations in support of U.S. policy in Libya , including assessing the opposition and determining their needs . 
Specific activities by CIA officers will be determined by conditions on the ground and would need further approval from the White House , the source said . 
A former senior intelligence official said officers `` might be advising -LRB- rebels -RRB- on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter-surveillance . '' 
Presidential findings are a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations . 
The CIA has had a presence in Libya for some time , a U.S. official told CNN earlier this month . 
`` The intelligence community is aggressively pursuing information on the ground , '' the official said . 
The CIA sent additional personnel to Libya to augment officers on the ground after the anti-government protests erupted , the official said , without giving details . 
CIA officers assisted with the rescue of one of two U.S. airmen whose fighter jet crashed in Libya on March 21 , a knowledgeable U.S. source said . 
NATO emphasized Thursday that the U.N. resolution authorizing action in Libya precludes `` occupation forces . '' 
NATO Adm. Giampaolo Di Paola , chairman of the NATO Military Committee , indicated that the presence of foreign intelligence personnel does not violate U.N. Security Council 1973 , which authorized action in Libya . 
Rebel forces have been demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42 years of rule in Libya . 
They have faced sustained attacks by a regime fighting to stay in power and portraying the opposition as terrorists backed by al Qaeda . 
Rebel forces have lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the al-Brega area , Bani said Wednesday . 
Ajdabiya , which is east of al-Brega , will be prepared as a `` defense point '' if the withdrawal continues farther east , he said . 
Amid the setbacks faced by rebels , a significant crack in Gadhafi 's armor surfaced when Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa fled to London on Wednesday and told the government there that he has resigned , the British Foreign Office said . 
Koussa -- a former head of Libyan intelligence -- was a stalwart defender of the government as recently as a month ago . 
But in recent weeks his demeanor had visibly changed . 
At one recent media briefing , he kept his head down as he read a statement and left early . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Koussa had not been offered any immunity . 
Koussa 's defection provides evidence `` that Gadhafi 's regime ... is fragmented , under pressure and crumbling from within , '' said Hague , adding that Koussa is voluntarily speaking with officials in the United Kingdom . 
Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Thursday that Koussa did not tell the government he planned to resign before he flew to Britain . 
Ibrahim said Koussa asked for sick leave and the government gave him permission to leave the country and receive intensive medical care . 
The government had another setback Thursday , with news that an official who was picked as Libyan ambassador to the United Nations has defected . 
A relative and an opposition leader said Thursday that former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki was in Cairo .

2011-04-01,"From Frederik Pleitgen and Jonathan Wald , CNN Buildings are riddled with bullet holes ; wreckage litters the streets Moammar Gadhafi 's forces laid siege to the western city A CNN team gets a firsthand look Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five weeks of battle and Misrata looks grim . 
Bullets have made Swiss cheese of buildings . 
Wreckage litters streets that are empty save opposition fighters desperately defending their city against Moammar Gadhafi 's heavy armor . 
The Libyan leader laid siege to the nation 's third largest and most prosperous city after opposition fighters took control here . 
Just two hours east of Tripoli , it was the final rebel stronghold in the West . 
Now it is a city of fear , uncertainty and human suffering . 
International reporters had not been able to access central Misrata and many of CNN 's reports were cobbled together from interviews with witnesses and doctors . 
That was until Wednesday , when CNN journalists were able to reach the city by boat . 
The fishing trawler was commissioned by two wealthy Libyan businessmen to carry 150 tons of food , medicine and other basic supplies . 
A heart surgeon on board said he wants to do everything he can to help : Libya is in `` mortal danger '' and he could not stand by without doing his share .

An opposition fighter celebrates atop the carcass of a tank .

Gadhafi 's foes say they are outgunned and fight back with the few weapons they possess , including rifles and rocket-propelled grenades . 
They provided CNN with a video of a man disabling a tank with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher .

2011-04-01,"By the CNN Wire Staff Mother of alleged rape victim ` angry ' NEW : Mother says she worries government will portray her daughter in a negative light Al-Obeidy will `` hopefully '' be seen by a few female journalists by Saturday , government says Her mother told CNN she had not seen her Al-Obeidy 's speaking out was unprecedented , a columnist says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman who was dragged away by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's officials after telling journalists that some of his troops had raped her will finally be seen by journalists in the coming days , a government spokesman said Thursday . 
Eman al-Obeidy will `` hopefully '' be visited by two or three female journalists by Saturday , Mousa Ibrahim said . 
He added that he did not know where she was Thursday . 
`` The only place she will be other than her family house '' is a shelter for women who have been raped , kidnapped , or otherwise victimized , he said . 
`` Maybe she is there . '' 
But al-Obeidy 's mother , Aisha Ahmad , told CNN Thursday that she still has not heard from her . 
Ahmad said she is concerned the government will portray her daughter in a negative light . 
Gadhafi 's son had a U.S. internship Libyan foreign minister flees country Ahmad said she no longer fears Gadhafi . 
`` If I were to see his face , I would strangle him , '' she told CNN in a previous interview at her modest home in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk . 
It was on Saturday that al-Obeidy , a 29-year-old law school graduate , burst into the Rixos Hotel as foreign journalists were having breakfast . 
Her face and legs were bruised . 
She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh . 
She said she had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . 
Her visible injuries appeared to support her claims , but CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story . 
`` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . 
`` My honor was violated by them . '' 
Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be rope burns on her wrists and ankles . 
Government officials tried to subdue her , but she persisted . 
Even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . 
Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head . 
One government official who was there to facilitate access for journalists pulled a pistol from his belt . 
Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment . 
Some journalists were beaten and kicked . 
CNN 's camera was confiscated and smashed beyond repair . 
As security forces dragged her away , al-Obeidy warned : `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it . '' 
The Libyan government first said al-Obeidy was mentally ill and drunk . 
Officials called her a prostitute . 
Later , the government changed its story and said al-Obeidy was sane enough to withstand legal proceedings . 
Libyan government spokesman Mousa Ibrahim said the men accused of raping al-Obeidy are being investigated , but the suspects , in turn , have filed countercharges for slander . 
Ahmad said she received a call Sunday from a man who offered her a bribe to reject al-Obeidy 's claims and persuade her daughter to change her tale . 
She stands by her daughter , she said . 
So does her entire family and tribe . 
To show their support , the family held an in-absentia engagement ceremony for al-Obeidy at a mosque in Tobruk on Monday . 
The attempt to discredit al-Obeidy as a promiscuous , un-Islamic woman ties into the idea of sexual shaming in a conservative Muslim society where it 's commonly believed that a woman who has been raped has lost her honor , said Mona Eltahawy , a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues . 
For a woman in such a society to come forward to claim she has been raped is no small thing . 
`` No one would do that unless they were raped , and especially in a conservative society , '' Eltahawy told CNN on Tuesday . 
Al-Obeidy 's act ended up being as significant as that of the discontented fruit vendor in Tunisia who set himself afire and sparked revolt in the entire region , Eltahawy said . 
The way al-Obeidy spoke out was unprecedented and she has already been hailed as a hero on social networking sites . 
Ahmad challenged Gadhafi to air video of her daughter on state television as proof of her well-being . 
She also said she was worried about her other daughter , with whom al-Obeidy was living . 
A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy 's sister 's house Monday , but were blocked by security forces . 
The sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN . 
Al-Obeidy 's story raced around the world after she stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning . 
Ahmad said she has not been able to stop crying . 
She has n't slept or eaten . 
She sees only her daughter 's distress shared so publicly at a pivotal moment of her nation 's history .

2011-04-01,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan rebels attempting to organize A government spokesman says the rebels are not serious about the cease-fire The ultimate goal is still regime change , the opposition says Sources tell CNN Gadhafi could relinquish power to someone in his inner circle Report : A senior adviser to one of Gadhafi 's sons is in London for talks Are you in Libya ? 
Send your pictures , video to iReport . 
Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Battles raged in Libya on Friday as mixed messages of peace put forth from several corners brought no guarantees of an end to the bloody conflict . 
In the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil laid out conditions for a cease-fire with Moammar Gadhafi 's forces . 
Among them were the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias from western cities , an end to the sieges laid on cities such as Misrata and freedom of expression for the Libyan people . 
But ultimately , he said , the opposition 's goal remains regime change in Libya . 
Jalil spoke at a podium with the United Nations special envoy to Libya , Abdelilah al-Khatib , who had carried the opposition 's message to Tripoli the day before . 
Rebels discuss cease-fire with Gadhafi Al-Khatib reiterated that the U.N. objective is to achieve a cease-fire and end the loss of civilian lives but he did not mention regime change , highlighting the discrepancy between the stated objectives of the Libyan opposition and the international community . 
Meanwhile in Tripoli , Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters that the rebels are not `` really serious '' about the offer of a cease-fire , which he said was tied to `` silly conditions . '' 
`` They are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people , who are holding up arms , who are tribal , violent , no unified leadership , al Qaeda links , and no one knows who they are . 
If this is not mad , then I do n't know what it is , '' he said . 
`` We will not leave our cities . 
We will not stop protecting our civilians . '' 
Ibrahim added that the Libyan government is ready for peace . 
Sources close to Gadhafi told CNN that political solutions are still possible but that the Libyan leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle . 
They said there is still time for dialogue but expressed doubts about who would represent the opposition . 
Any transition , they said , would involve Gadhafi 's second son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and for such a transition to take place there would first have to be an end to the fighting . 
The sources added that there is an emerging consensus within the regime that the old guard must prepare to give way to a younger generation of leaders . 
Citing unnamed British government sources , the Guardian newspaper reported Friday that a senior adviser to Saif Gadhafi was in London for secret talks with British officials . 
That adviser , Mohammed Ismael , told CNN earlier this week that he would be traveling to London for family reasons . 
Calls placed to his mobile phone by CNN on Friday were not answered . 
Asked about the Guardian report , a British Foreign Office spokesman neither confirmed nor denied it . 
`` We are not going to provide running commentary on our contacts with Libyan officials , '' the spokesman said . 
`` In any contact that we do have , we make it clear that Gadhafi has to go . '' 
Ibrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said he did not know where Ismael was and declined to comment on what he might be doing . 
The Libyan sources told CNN that for now , Gadhafi remains confident the regime can withstand any challenge from the rebels . 
Bad weather for the last two days forced a hiatus in international airstrikes , and in that time , rebel forces retreated from areas they had gained . 
But in a fresh offensive Friday , Libyan opposition forces led by army units that have defected from Gadhafi 's forces were able to pushed back Gadhafi 's troops , rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . 
Rebels were fighting with newly refurbished rocket launchers and artillery delivered to the frontlines Thursday night by the army units that switched sides , Abdulmolah said . 
Fighting raged at the western gates of the oil town of al-Brega , which has changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of Libya 's civil war . 
In the west , witnesses reported more explosions and fierce urban warfare in the besieged city of Misrata , once the final rebel stronghold in the western part of the country . 
Gadhafi 's heavily armed forces continued their pounding Friday amid a series of political setbacks . 
Observers said the surge in firepower reaffirmed the regime 's message : Gadhafi is determined to prevail , and the defections of some of his high-profile allies are making him nervous . 
`` You 're certainly getting evidence that there are a lot of tensions , '' said Anne-Marie Slaughter , a professor of international affairs at Princeton University . 
`` Each person that leaves , that makes it a little scarier for the people that are still remaining , '' she said . 
`` And you may , at some point , get a tipping effect . '' 
On Thursday , word emerged that Gadhafi 's pick for U.N. ambassador , former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki , had defected to Egypt . 
The day before , the latest foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , fled to London and told the government there that he had resigned . 
U.S. officials claim Gadhafi 's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned airstrikes . 
But the dictator 's forces still outnumber rebels by about 10-to-1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Navy Adm. Mike Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday . 
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , also speaking before the House committee , warned that the Libyan rebels still need significant training and assistance . 
`` It 's pretty much a pickup ballgame '' right now , he said . 
U.S. and British officials say no decision has been made about whether to arm the opposition .

2011-04-01,"The president 's Libya policy comes under congressional criticism `` Of course this is about regime change , '' a congressman says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite having CIA agents on the ground and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's exit as stated policy , U.S. officials continue to say the NATO-led military mission in Libya is only for its authorized humanitarian purposes . 
The seeming discrepancy is part of a delicate diplomatic posture by the Obama administration on the complex overseas operation that involves a U.N. Security Council resolution , a multinational military force and the symbolism of presidential statements and actions . 
With the military mission shifting Thursday to a new phase of full NATO control after initial U.S. leadership , divisions among alliance partners and within Congress became more evident , exacerbated by the administration 's differing military and political goals . 
President Barack Obama continues to insist that arming the Libyan rebels remained an option under consideration , while NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet ruled it out . 
At House and Senate committee hearings , Republicans grilled Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen on the U.S. role in Libya . 
`` To say this is not about regime change is crazy , '' said Republican Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado . 
`` Of course this is about regime change . 
Why not just be honest with the American people ? '' 
Obama has said the motivation for launching military action on March 19 was to prevent a massacre of civilians by Libyan military forces descending on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
Kucinich : Only Congress can declare war Libya hearings aplenty on the Hill Since then , airstrikes carried out mostly with U.S. planes and missiles have taken out much of Gadhafi 's anti-aircraft capability and destroyed ground forces and supply lines . 
While Gadhafi 's forces have pulled back from Benghazi , they reclaimed territory from the rebels in recent days , leading to fears of a prolonged stalemate without stronger military support for the rebels . 
On Thursday , White House spokesman Jay Carney noted the United States turned over control of the Libya mission to NATO that morning -- 12 days after it began -- to fulfill Obama 's pledge to the nation that U.S. leadership would end within `` days , not weeks . '' 
While Carney said the United States and its allies would keep up pressure on Gadhafi 's government , he acknowledged that it was impossible to say when the mission would end . 
Regardless of when , he said , `` the scope of the U.S. involvement will be limited '' and Obama continues to reject any possibility of sending in U.S. ground troops . 
At the same time , a former counterterrorism official confirmed the existence of a presidential finding that authorizes the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct operations supporting U.S. policy in Libya . 
A presidential finding is a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations , and a former senior intelligence official said such operations could include `` advising on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter surveillance . '' 
Top administration officials distinguished between the military mission charged with protecting Libyan civilians and the other non-military efforts -- including sanctions , freezing assets and CIA operations -- aimed at hastening Gadhafi 's departure . 
`` Does the United States have the capacity to unilaterally with military force produce regime change in Libya or another country ? 
We probably do , '' Carney told reporters . 
`` Is that a desirable action to take when you have your eye on the long game here in terms of Libya 's future , the future ... interests of the United States and the region ? 
No. '' Obama 's dual-track policy , with the military coalition protecting Libyan civilians while the United States pursues `` as a political , diplomatic and economic policy '' the end of Gadhafi 's rule , is the best fit for the Libya situation , Carney insisted , citing the international backing for the military mission through a U.N. Security Council resolution and Arab League support . 
Critics complained that it is both dishonest and a mistake for the military objective to differ from the policy objective . 
At a House Armed Services Committee hearing , Rep. Chris Gibson , R-New York , said the mission 's `` military and political goals are not harmonized , '' while Coffman called it `` just the most muddled definition of an operation probably in U.S. military history . '' 
On the Democratic side , liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio challenged Obama 's legal power to commit U.S. forces to a combat role without congressional authorization . 
`` This is a clear and arrogant violation of our Constitution , '' Kucinich declared on the House floor . 
`` Even a war launched ostensibly for humanitarian reasons is still a war and only Congress can declare a war . '' 
Sen. John McCain of Arizona , the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 2008 , warned that pulling U.S. forces back to a supporting role under NATO control undermined the military mission at a key moment . 
`` For the United States to be withdrawing our unique offensive capabilities at this time sends the exact wrong signal both to our coalition partners as well as to the Gadhafi regime , especially to those Libyan officials whom we are trying to compel to break with Gadhafi , '' McCain said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing . 
`` I need not remind our witnesses that the purpose of using military force is to achieve policy goals , '' McCain told Gates and Mullen . 
`` But in this case , not only are our military means out of alignment with our desired end of Gadhafi leaving power , we are now effectively stopping our strike missions all together without having accomplished our goal . '' 
While Obama administration officials have described the continuing U.S. role in the military mission as supportive -- involving refueling , intelligence , surveillance and communications -- Gates said Thursday that U.S. strike aircraft such as A-10 and AC-130s could still be made available to NATO . 
However , he added that he believed NATO allies had the capacity to take out Libyan ground forces as necessary under the mission 's mandate of protecting civilian populations . 
Appearing before both the House and Senate panels at separate hearings , Gates said the no-fly zone had been established and now needed to be sustained , but acknowledged `` you could have a situation in which you achieve the military goal but do not achieve the political goal . ''

2011-04-01,"By Gloria Borger , CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger : Barack Obama argued for acting as part of a coalition She says that kind of leadership raises question of who 's driving the operation Republican critics are able to attack style of leadership shown by Obama , she says Borger : GOP presidential contenders do n't have to take stand for or against intervention Editor 's note : Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN , appearing regularly on CNN 's `` The Situation Room , '' `` AC360 , '' `` John King , USA '' and `` State of the Union . '' 
Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To recap : The United States and its allies are scrambling to defeat Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in Libya . 
There 's a no-fly zone , a freezing of assets , threats about prosecution in international courts and an arms embargo . 
We 're trying to get Gadhafi to surrender -- and , hopefully , leave . 
And , by the way , the president has secretly ordered the CIA to try to figure out just who the rebels are -- and whether they 're a dependable enough crew , worthy of our money or our arms . 
`` We have n't ruled out arming the rebels , '' a senior administration official tells me . 
`` But there are a lot of questions that need to be answered first -- including whether they are even trained to use what we might give them . '' 
If the policy sounds , er , improvisational , that 's because it is . 
Naturally , any form of ad-hoc-ism is not exactly comforting , especially when it comes to foreign military intervention . 
Most often , intervention works this way : When we are attacked , we respond . 
When people plan to attack us , we try to prevent it . 
Presidents are asked to consult with Congress , provide a mission , goals , timetables and endgames . 
We like to know how we 're getting out before we get in . 
We are understandably war-weary . 
Yet when the president proposes an alternative to the now unpopular all-or-nothing-go-it-alone military interventions of Iraq and Afghanistan , it 's still somehow unsettling . 
We do n't want to go it alone . 
Yet we 're not sure we trust others to take the lead . 
View from Libya 's ` shaky ' frontline Gates : Obama followed War Powers Act Kucinich : Only Congress can declare war When the president says , as he did in his speech Monday , `` We should not be afraid to act -- but the burden of action should not be America 's alone , '' we get it . 
But we also start wondering : What happens if we 're not driving the car ? 
We always drive the car . 
Truth is , we like to drive . 
And when we 're not driving , we think it 's easy -- even likely -- for the coalition to veer off course . 
So here 's the conundrum : We do n't want to go it alone . 
Yet we 're not sure we trust others to take the lead . 
And that 's where the Republican political play is right now . 
And it 's easy : Sidestep the entire question of intervention , while either -LRB- a -RRB- saying Obama took too long to do it or -LRB- b -RRB- he did it in a wimpy -LRB- and possibly self-defeating -RRB- way -LRB- spelled `` coalition '' -RRB- . 
In other words , do n't lead . 
Just say Obama ca n't lead . 
Consider Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , who recently complained to a local radio station that `` The Obama administration 's position has been to say , ` You know , we 're just one of the boys . 
We 're not going to try to be the leader . ' 
And we see that when you do n't have strong leadership from the strongest country in the world , then everybody else scatters out and breaks up . '' 
So , um , what 's the right thing to do ? 
`` I 'm not saying ` Do this , do that , ' '' he told WFMN radio in Jackson , Mississippi , going on to say we need to make sure we have the resources we need to accomplish the mission . 
Now is that clear ? 
Mitt Romney says he supports military action , but says Obama is taking orders -- from the Arab League and the UN -- rather than giving them . 
And then there 's Newt Gingrich , who was for an intervention before he was against it -- at least the way Obama did it . 
Republicans can get away with the Obama-doesn ` t-believe-in-American-exceptionalism stuff for awhile because the public itself is ambivalent . 
In fact , a Pew poll taken on the eve of the president 's speech showed that only 47 % of Americans believed that the airstrikes in Libya were warranted . 
And when asked about whether there is a clear goal , the public also seemed largely unconvinced . 
Most notably , independent voters said there 's no clear goal , by a 57 % to 35 % margin . 
The president deserves props for the immense coalition he put together , not to mention a successful vote in the UN Security Council against Libya . 
Yet Obama has succeeded in making no one completely happy : Those who wanted unilateral intervention quickly say Obama has dithered , caring more about building a coalition than saving the Libyan people . 
On the other end of the spectrum , those worried about intervention without a clear exit strategy consider Obama to be too hasty . 
So he ca n't win . 
If Gadhafi goes , Obama 's a hero . 
And all of that improvisation will suddenly look like a well-constructed sonata . 
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger .

2011-04-01,"Journalists recount being taken in Libya All four captives were subject to physical and mental abuse The lone woman in the group says she was subjected to sexual abuse They believe they were spared because of the potential repercussions of killing Americans -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Held by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , four New York Times journalists felt death was certain . 
The feeling was never stronger than when the soldiers hovered over Lynsey Addario , Stephen Farrell , Tyler Hicks , and Anthony Shadid with automatic weapons as they lay on the ground . 
`` I think we all had that -- that very sinking feeling that this was it , '' Shadid said on CNN 's `` AC360 Thursday . 
`` And I remember on my stomach looking up and I remember him being a tall soldier and him saying , ` Shoot them . ' '' 
The four journalists were released this month after being held for about a week . 
Addario recalled that physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her captors started almost immediately . 
Journalists taken by Gadhafi 's forces `` I remember I was sitting in the car and I 'm bound , and they had bound my hands so tight they were starting to go numb , '' Addario told CNN 's Anderson Cooper . 
`` And I was sitting there , sort of blowing the wisps of hair out of my face , and this guy came up next to me . 
And my instinct was that , ` Oh , he 's going to help me , ' and he just punched me in the side of the face . '' 
`` Then I started crying because I thought , ` It 's only going to get worse , '' she said . 
`` We 're in the first 15 minutes . 
This could last months , you know ? ' '' 
Addario said the man who punched her in the face laughed afterward , and , as the only woman , she also had to deal with sexual assault . 
`` They came and groped me ... I 've never been touched like that in the Muslim world , and I 've been working 11 years in the Muslim world , '' she said . 
`` That 's when I said , `` Oh , God , I just do n't want to be raped . '' 
The four colleagues initially thought they were safe as they began `` pulling back slowly '' from Ajdabiya , a northeastern Libyan city as Gadhafi 's troops advanced , Hicks said . 
They had escaped a firefight between the opposing sides . 
But their retreat from the area was going too slowly , Shadid recalled . 
`` It must have been seconds , but it felt like minutes , '' he said . 
`` We saw the green military uniforms , the military vehicles . 
And then almost -- I mean almost instantly -- you realized that you were actually at a government checkpoint and that we had ... pretty much no options at that point . '' 
Fleeing was not an option , Addario said . 
`` You ca n't turn around and go back because they 'll open fire . 
I mean , you would assume they would open fire , '' she said . 
`` You look more suspicious if you try and run away . '' 
Addario said their driver moved on to Plan B , telling the soldiers the people in the car were journalists . 
But Gadhafi 's troops were not swayed by that argument . 
That was n't working , '' Farrell remembered . 
Tarhouni : Oil to fund the Libyan rebels `` We were put on our knees first and there was a lot of ... slapping , '' Shadid said . 
`` There was emptying our pockets . 
And I remember one of the soldiers was yelling at me , ` You 're the translator . 
You 're the spy . ' '' 
It was soon after then that one of the soldiers threatened to kill them . 
But `` another soldier said to him , ` You ca n't . 
They 're Americans . ' '' 
That did seem to hit a chord , '' Farrell said . 
Shadid added , `` I think the idea of executing three Americans and a British journalist would have had implications ... There was going to be repercussions of basically executing us there at a checkpoint . '' 
While the abusive during captivity was n't limited to Addario , it often focused on her . 
In prison , one man tried to drag her out of her cell , but quit after she put up a fight . 
In the back of a Land Cruiser , she had to deal with another `` twisted '' scenario . 
`` A guy reached over from the front seat and started caressing my hair either like a mother would a son or a daughter , '' Addario said . 
`` And then he started touching my face , very sort of gently and saying this phrase over and over , '' she said . 
`` And I sort of tried to put my head down . 
`` And he picked it up and just kept caressing me in this weird sort of tender way . 
And he was saying this phrase over and over , '' she said . 
`` And I said to Anthony , I said what 's ` Mort ? ' 
And Anthony said , ` He 's telling you you 're going to die tonight . ' 
I mean , what can you say ? '' 
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists , 14 journalists have been killed around the world so far in 2011 , including two slain by crossfire in Libya and one each in Tunisia , Egypt and Yemen , some of the other Arab countries that have experienced uprisings this year . 
Sabah al-Bazee , a freelance journalist who regularly contributed to CNN , was killed this week in Iraq . 
Currently , two Reuters journalists are missing in Syria .

2011-04-01,"Vehicles belonging to forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi explode after an air strike by coalition forces , along a road between Benghazi and Ajdabiyah March 20 , 2011 . 
It is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . 
PARIS | Fri Apr 1 , 2011 9:14 am EDT PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - It is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . 
Only Nicolas Sarkozy saw the popular revolt that began in Libya on February 15 as an opportunity for political and diplomatic redemption . 
Whether the French president 's energetic leadership of an international coalition to protect the Libyan people from Muammar Gaddafi will be enough to revive his sagging domestic fortunes in next year 's election is highly uncertain . 
But by pushing for military strikes that he hopes might repair France 's reputation in the Arab world , Sarkozy helped shape what type of war it would be . 
The road to Western military intervention was paved with mutual suspicion , fears of another quagmire in a Muslim country and doubts about the largely unknown ragtag Libyan opposition with which the West has thrown in its lot . 
That will make it harder to hold together an uneasy coalition of Americans , Europeans and Arabs , the longer Gaddafi holds out . 
Almost two weeks into the air campaign , Western policymakers fret about the risk of a stray bomb hitting a hospital or an orphanage , or of the conflict sliding into a prolonged stalemate . 
There is no doubt the outcome in Tripoli will have a bearing on the fate of the popular movement for change across the Arab world . 
But because this war was born in Paris it will also have consequences for Europe . 
`` It 's high time that Europeans stopped exporting their own responsibilities to Washington , '' says Nick Witney , a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations . 
`` If the West fails in Libya , it will be primarily a European failure . '' 
When the first Arab pro-democracy uprisings shook the thrones of aging autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt in January , France had got itself on the wrong side of history . 
Foreign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie had enjoyed a winter holiday in Tunisia , a former French colony , oblivious to the rising revolt . 
She and her family had taken free flights on the private jet of a businessman close to President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali , and then publicly offered the government French assistance with riot control just a few days before Ben Ali was ousted by popular protests . 
Worse was to come . 
It turned out that French Prime Minister Francois Fillon had spent his Christmas vacation up the Nile as the guest of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , the next autocrat in the Arab democracy movement 's firing line , while Sarkozy and his wife Carla had soaked up the winter sunshine in Morocco , another former French territory ruled by a barely more liberal divine-right monarch . 
Television stations were re-running embarrassing footage of the president giving Gaddafi a red-carpet welcome in Paris in 2007 , when Libya 's `` brother leader '' planted his tent in the grounds of the Hotel de Marigny state guest house across the road from the Elysee presidential palace . 
On February 27 , a few days after Libyan rebels hoisted the pre-Gaddafi tricolor flag defiantly in Benghazi , Sarkozy fired his foreign minister . 
In a speech announcing the appointment of Alain Juppe as her successor , Sarkozy cited the need to adapt France 's foreign and security policy to the new situation created by the Arab uprisings . 
`` This is an historic change , '' he said . 
`` We must not be afraid of it . 
We must have one sole aim : to accompany , support and help the people who have chosen freedom . '' 
MAN IN THE WHITE SHIRT Yet the international air campaign against Gaddafi 's forces might never have happened without the self-appointed activism of French public intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy , a left-leaning philosopher and talk-show groupie , who lobbied Sarkozy to take up the cause of Libya 's pro-democracy rebels . 
Libya was the latest of a string of international causes that the libertarian icon with his unbuttoned white designer shirts and flowing mane of greying hair has championed over the last two decades after Bosnian Muslims , Algerian secularists , Afghan rebels and Georgia 's side in the conflict with Russia . 
Levy went to meet the Libyan rebels and telephoned Sarkozy from Benghazi in early March . 
`` I 'd like to bring you the Libyan Massouds , '' Levy says he told the president , comparing the anti-Gaddafi opposition with former Afghan warlord Ahmad Shah Massoud , who fought against the Islamist Taliban before being assassinated . 
`` As Gaddafi only clings on through violence , I think he 'll collapse , '' the philosopher told Reuters in an interview . 
On March 10 , Levy accompanied two envoys of the Libyan Transitional Council to Sarkozy 's office . 
To their surprise and to the consternation of France 's allies , the president recognized the council as the `` legitimate representative of the Libyan people '' and told them he favored not only establishing a no-fly zone to protect them but also carrying out `` limited targeted strikes '' against Gaddafi 's forces . 
In doing so without consultation on the eve of a European Union summit called to discuss Libya , Sarkozy upstaged Washington , which was still debating what to do , embarrassed London , which wanted broad support for a no-fly zone , and infuriated Berlin , France 's closest European partner . 
He also stunned his own foreign minister , who learned about the decision to recognize the opposition from a news agency dispatch , aides said , while in Brussels trying to coax the EU into backing a no-fly zone . 
`` Quite a lot of members of the European Council were irritated to discover that France had recognized the Libyan opposition council and the Elysee was talking of targeted strikes , '' a senior European diplomat said . 
Across the Channel , British Prime Minister David Cameron , aware of the deep unpopularity of the Iraq war , had turned his back on Tony Blair 's doctrine of liberal interventionism when he took office in 2010 . 
But after facing criticism over the slow evacuation of British nationals from Libya and a trade-promotion trip to the Gulf in the midst of the Arab uprisings , he overruled cabinet skeptics , military doubters and critics among his own Conservative lawmakers to join Sarkozy in campaigning for military action . 
However , Cameron sought to reassure parliament that he was not entering an Iraq-style open-ended military commitment . 
`` This is different to Iraq . 
This is not going into a country , knocking over its government and then owning and being responsible for everything that happens subsequently , '' he said . 
In Britain , as in France , the government won bipartisan support for intervention . 
In Germany , on the other hand , the Libyan uprising was an unwelcome distraction from domestic politics . 
It played directly into the campaign for regional elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg , a south-western state which Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrats had governed since 1953 . 
Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle , leader of the Free Democrats , the liberal junior partners in Merkel 's coalition , tried to surf on pacifist public opinion by opposing military action . 
Polls showed two-thirds of voters opposed German involvement in Libya , a country where Nazi Germany 's Afrika Korps had suffered desert defeats in World War Two . 
Present-day Germany 's armed forces were already overstretched in Afghanistan , where some 5,000 soldiers are engaged in an unpopular long-term mission . 
Westerwelle made it impossible for Merkel to support a no-fly zone , even without participating . 
He publicly criticized the Franco-British proposal for a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to prevent Gaddafi using his air force against Libyan civilians . 
Merkel said she was skeptical . 
The Germans prevented a March 11 EU summit from making any call for a no-fly zone , much to the frustration of the French and British . 
Relations between France 's Juppe and Westerwelle deteriorated further the following week when Germany prevented foreign ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized powers from calling for a no-fly zone in Libya . 
Westerwelle told reporters : `` Military intervention is not the solution . 
From our point of view , it is very difficult and dangerous . 
We do not want to get sucked into a war in North Africa . 
We would not like to step on a slippery slope where we all are at the end in a war . '' 
That argument angered allies . 
As the meeting broke up , a senior European diplomat tells Reuters , Juppe turned to Westerwelle and said : `` Now that you have achieved everything you wanted , Gaddafi can go ahead and massacre his people . '' 
When the issue came to the U.N. Security Council on March 17 , 10 days before the Baden-Wuerttemberg election , Germany abstained , along with Russia , China , India and Brazil , and said it would take no part in military operations . 
Ironically , that stance seems to have been politically counterproductive . 
The center-right coalition lost the regional election anyway , and both leaders were severely criticized by German media for having isolated Germany from its western partners , including the United States . 
The main political beneficiaries were the ecologist Greens , seen as both anti-nuclear and anti-war . 
In Washington , meanwhile , President Barack Obama was , as usual , taking his time to make up his mind . 
Military action in Libya was the last thing the U.S. president needed , just when he was trying to extricate American troops from two unpopular wars in Muslim countries launched by his predecessor , George W. Bush . 
Obama had sought to rebuild damaged relations with the Muslim world , seen as a key driver of radicalization and terrorism against the United States . 
The president trod a fine line in embracing pro-democracy and reform movements in the Arab world and Iran while trying to avoid undermining vital U.S. interests in the absolute monarchies of Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and other Gulf states . 
Compared to those challenges , Libya was a sideshow . 
The United States had no big economic or political interests in the North African oil and gas producing state and instinctively saw it as part of Europe 's backyard . 
Obama had also sought to encourage allies , notably in Europe , to take more responsibility for their own security issues . 
Spelling out the administration 's deep reluctance to get dragged into another potential Arab quagmire , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a farewell speech to officer cadets at the West Point military academy on March 4 : `` In my opinion , any future Defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should ` have his head examined ' , as General -LRB- Douglas -RRB- MacArthur so delicately put it . '' 
Prominent U.S. foreign policy lawmakers , including Democratic Senator John Kerry and Republican Senator John McCain pressed the Obama administration in early March to impose a `` no - fly '' zone over Libya and explore other military options , such as bombing runways . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had said after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on February 28 that a `` no-fly '' zone was `` an option which we are actively considering '' . 
But the White House pushed back against pressure from lawmakers . 
`` It would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said on March 7 . 
`` We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we 're pursuing . '' 
While Carney said a no-fly zone was a serious option , other U.S. civilian and military officials cautioned that it would be difficult to enforce . 
On March 10 , U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper forecast in Congress that Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces would prevail in the long term , saying Gaddafi appeared to be `` hunkering down for the duration '' . 
If there was to be intervention , it had become clear , it would have to come quickly . 
U.S. officials say the key event that helped Clinton and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , persuade Obama of the need for intervention was a March 12 decision by the Arab League to ask the U.N. Security Council to declare a no-fly zone to protect the Libyan population . 
The Arab League 's unprecedented resolve -- the organization has long been plagued by chronic divisions and a lack of spine -- reflected the degree to which Gaddafi had alienated his peers , especially Saudi Arabia . 
When the quixotic colonel bothered to attend Arab summits , it was usually to insult the Saudi king and other veteran rulers . 
The Arab League decision gave a regional seal of approval that Western nations regarded as vital for military action . 
Moreover , two Arab states - Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - soon said they would participate in enforcing a no-fly zone , and a third , Lebanon , co-sponsored a United Nations resolution to authorize the use of force . 
Arab diplomats said Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa , a former Egyptian foreign minister with presidential ambitions , played the key role in squeezing an agreement out of the closed-door meeting . 
Syria , Sudan , Algeria and Yemen were all against any move to invite foreign intervention in an Arab state . 
But diplomats said that by couching the resolution as an appeal to the U.N. Security Council , Moussa maneuvered his way around Article VI of the Arab League 's statutes requiring that such decisions be taken unanimously . 
It was he who announced the outcome , saying Gaddafi 's government had lost legitimacy because of its `` crimes against the Libyan people '' . 
The African Union , in which Gaddafi played an active but idiosyncratic role , condemned the Libyan leader 's crackdown but rejected foreign military intervention and created a panel of leaders to try to resolve the conflict through dialogue . 
However , all three African states on the Security Council - South Africa , Nigeria and Gabon - voted for the resolution . 
France acted as if it had AU support anyway . 
Sarkozy invited the organization 's secretary-general , Jean Ping , to the Elysee palace for a showcase summit of coalition countries on the day military action began , and he attended , providing African political cover for the operation . 
Having failed to win either EU or G8 backing for a no-fly zone , and with the United States internally divided and holding back , France and Britain were in trouble in their quest for a U.N. resolution despite the Arab League support . 
Gaddafi 's forces had regrouped and recaptured a swathe of the western and central coastal plain , including some key oil terminals , and were advancing fast on Benghazi , a city of 700,000 and the rebels ' stronghold . 
If international intervention did not come within days , it would be too late . 
Gaddafi 's troops would be in the population centers , making surgical air strikes impossible without inflicting civilian casualties . 
In the nick of time , Obama came off the fence on March 15 at a two-part meeting of his National Security Council . 
Hillary Clinton participated by telephone from Paris , Susan Rice by secure video link from New York . 
Both were deeply aware of the events of the 1990s , when Bill Clinton 's administration , in which Rice was an adviser on Africa , had failed to prevent genocide in Rwanda , and only intervened in Bosnia after the worst massacre in Europe since World War Two . 
They reviewed what was at stake now . 
There were credible reports that Gaddafi forces were preparing to massacre the rebels . 
What signal would it send to Arab democrats if the West let him get away with that , and if Mubarak and Ben Ali , whose armies refused to turn their guns on the people , were overthrown while Gaddafi , who had used his airforce , tanks and artillery against civilian protesters , survived in office ? 
The president overruled doubters among his military and national security advisers and decided the United States would support an ambitious U.N. resolution going beyond just a no-fly zone , on the strict condition that Washington would quickly hand over leadership of the military action to its allies . 
`` Within days , not weeks , '' one participant quoted him as saying . 
A senior administration official , speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity , said the key concern was to avoid any impression that the United States was once again unilaterally bombing an Arab country . 
Asked what had swung Washington toward agreeing to join military action in Libya , he said : `` It 's more that events were evolving and so positions had to address the change of events . '' 
`` The key elements were the Arab League statement , the Lebanese support , co-sponsorship of the actual resolution as the Arab representative on the Security Council , a series of conversations with Arab leaders over the course of that week , leading up to the resolution . 
All of that convinced us that the Arab countries were fully supportive of the broad resolution that would provide the authorization necessary to protect civilians and to provide humanitarian relief , and then the -LRB- March 19 -RRB- gathering in Paris , confirmed that there was support for the means necessary to carry out the resolution , namely the use of military force , '' the official said . 
When Rice told her French and British counterparts at the United Nations that Washington now favored a far more aggressive Security Council resolution , including air and sea strikes , they first feared a trap . 
Was Obama deliberately trying to provoke a Russian veto , a French official mused privately . 
`` I had a phone call from Susan Rice , Tuesday 8 p.m. , and a phone call from Susan Rice at 11 p.m. , and everything had changed in three hours , '' a senior Western envoy told Reuters . 
`` On Wednesday morning , at the -LRB- Security -RRB- Council , in a sort of totally awed silence , Susan Rice said : ` We want to be allowed to strike Libyan forces on the ground . ' 
There was a sort of a bit surprised silence . '' 
Right up to the day of the vote , when Juppe took a plane to New York to swing vital votes behind the resolution , Moscow 's attitude was uncertain . 
So too were the three African votes . 
British and French diplomats tried desperately to contact the Nigerian , South African and Gabonese ambassadors but kept being told they were in a meeting . 
`` There was drama right up to the last minute , '' another U.N. diplomat said . 
That day , March 17 , Clinton had just come out of a television studio in Tunis , epicenter of the first Arab democratic revolution , when she spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on a secure cellphone . 
Lavrov , who had strongly opposed a no-fly zone when they met in Geneva on February 28 and remained skeptical when they talked again in Paris on March 14 , told her Moscow would not block the resolution . 
The senior U.S. official denied that Washington had offered Russia trade and diplomatic benefits in return for acquiescence , as suggested by a senior non-American diplomat . 
However , Obama telephoned President Dimitry Medvedev the following week and reaffirmed his support for Russia 's bid to join the World Trade Organization , which U.S. ally Georgia is blocking . 
China too abstained , allowing the resolution to pass with 10 votes in favor , five abstentions and none against . 
It authorized the use of `` all necessary measures '' - code for military action -- to protect the civilian population but expressly ruled out a foreign occupation force in any part of Libya . 
The United States construes it to allow arms sales to the rebels . 
Most others do not . 
Reuters reported exclusively on March 29 that Obama had signed a secret order authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel forces . 
The White House and the Central Intelligence Agency declined comment . 
Clinton said no decision had been taken on whether to arm the rebels . 
No sooner had the first cruise missiles been fired than the Arab League 's Moussa complained that the Western powers had gone beyond the U.N. resolution and caused civilian casualties . 
His outburst appeared mainly aimed at assuaging Arab public opinion , particularly in Egypt , and he muted his criticism after telephone calls from Paris , London and Washington . 
Turkey , the leading Muslim power in NATO with big economic interests in Libya , bitterly criticized the military action in an Islamic country . 
The Turks were exasperated to see France , the most vociferous adversary of its EU membership bid , leading the coalition . 
Sarkozy , who alternated on a brief maiden visit to Ankara on February 25 between trying to sell Turkish leaders French nuclear power plants and telling them bluntly to drop their EU ambitions , further angered Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan by failing to invite Turkey to the Paris conference on Libya . 
Italy , the former colonial power which had Europe 's biggest trade and investment ties with Libya , had publicly opposed military action until the last minute , but opened its air bases to coalition forces as soon as the U.N. resolution passed . 
However , Rome quickly demanded that NATO , in which it had a seat at the decision-making table , should take over command of the whole operation . 
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini threatened to take back control of the vital Italian bases unless the mission was placed under NATO . 
But Turkey and France were fighting diplomatic dogfights at NATO headquarters . 
Ankara wanted to use its NATO veto put the handcuffs on the coalition to stop offensive operations . 
France wanted to keep political leadership away from the U.S.-led military alliance to avoid a hostile reaction in the Arab world . 
The United States signaled its determination to hand over operational command within days , not weeks , as Obama had promised , and wanted tried-and-trusted NATO at the wheel . 
It took a week of wrangling before agreement was reached for NATO to take charge of the entire military campaign . 
In return , France won agreement to create a `` contact group '' including Arab and African partners , to coordinate political efforts on Libya 's future . 
Turkey was assuaged by being invited to a London international conference that launched that process . 
That enabled the United States to lower its profile and Obama to declare that Washington would not act alone as the world 's policeman `` wherever repression occurs '' . 
While the president promised to scale back U.S. involvement to a `` supporting role '' , the military statistics tell a different tale . 
As of March 29 , the United States had fired all but 7 of the 214 cruise missiles used in the conflict and flown 1,103 sorties compared to 669 for all other allies combined . 
It also dropped 455 of the first 600 bombs , according to the Pentagon . 
For all the showcasing of Arab involvement , only six military aircraft from Qatar had arrived in theater by March 30 . 
They joined French air patrols but did not fly combat missions , a military source said . 
Sarkozy announced that the United Arab Emirates would send 12 F16 fighters , but NATO and UAE officials refused to say when they would arrive . 
Britain 's Cameron spoke of unspecified logistical contributions from Kuwait and Jordan . 
The main Arab contribution is clearly political cover rather than military assets . 
While the duration and the outcome of the war remain uncertain , some political casualties are already visible . 
Unless the conflict ends in disaster , Germany and its chancellor and foreign minister - particularly the latter - are set to emerge as losers . 
`` I can tell you there are people in London and Paris who are asking themselves whether this Germany is the kind of country we would like to have as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council . 
That 's a legitimate question which was n't posed before , '' a senior European diplomat told Reuters . 
German officials brush aside such talk , saying Berlin would have the backing of its western partners and needs support from developing and emerging countries more in tune with its abstention on the Libya resolution . 
Merkel has moved quickly to try to limit the damage . 
She attended the Paris conference and went along with an EU summit statement on March 25 welcoming the U.N. resolution on which her own government had abstained a week earlier . 
She also offered NATO extra help in aerial surveillance in Afghanistan to free up Western resources for the Libya campaign . 
A second conspicuous casualty has been the European Union 's attempt to build a common foreign , security and Defense policy , and the official meant to personify that ambition , High Representative Catherine Ashton . 
Many in Paris , London , Brussels and Washington have drawn the conclusion that European Defense is an illusion , given Germany 's visceral reticence about military action . 
Future serious operations are more likely to be left to NATO , or to coalitions of the willing around Britain and France . 
By general agreement , Ashton has so far had a bad war . 
Despite having been among the first European officials to embrace the Arab uprisings and urge the EU to engage with democracy movements in North Africa , she angered both the British and French by airing her doubts about a no-fly zone and the Germans by subsequently welcoming the U.N. resolution . 
Unable to please everyone , she managed to please no one . 
As for Sarkozy , whether he emerges as a hero or a reckless adventurer may depend on events beyond his control in the sands of Libya . 
Justin Vaisse , a Frenchman who heads the Center for the Study of the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution think-tank in Washington , detected an undertone of `` Francophobia and Sarkophobia '' among U.S. policy elites as the war began . 
`` Either the war will go well , and he will look like a far-sighted , decisive leader , or it will go badly and reinforce the image of a showboating cowboy driving the world into war , '' Vaisse said . 
The jury is still out .

Once upon a time , a market seller in Tunisia set fire to ... the Arab order , NATO , European unity , US politics , ... Big fuel buildup problem if you are a firefighter . 
I now pity the rebels in Libya . 
They are needing to rely now on the same Europe that could n't even defend its own territory in two World Wars without a massive American commitment , and which needded U. S. military punch even to settle the conflict the Balkansafter European soldiers stood by during masacres . 
Perhaps the rebels should have learned a lesson from Croatia after it got its no fly zone and built an Army before trying to take back the rest of their nation . 
I hope the rebels win and do in fact create a democracy in Libya , but the way the Syrian dictator is acting , he no longer fears a successful revolt in his nation . 
Gaddafi is showing that guns for hire do work . 
I just wonder why the rebels have n't also hired mercenaries to form a leadership cohort in conjunction with the soldiers who switched to the rebellion . 
Perhaps though NATO is waiting for Gaddafi to put his tanks and artellery on exposed terrain during their long march to Bengazi . 
We can only hope .

2011-04-03,"By the CNN Wire Staff Coalition airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles , reports say A government spokesman says the rebels are not serious about a cease-fire An opposition leader calls for the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Notions of a cease-fire in Libya quickly faded Saturday as a battle raged for control of the oil town of al-Brega , where rebel fighters claimed they had lost fighters and vehicles to NATO airstrikes . 
Airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters , spokesmen for the Libyan opposition said Saturday . 
Seven others were wounded . 
NATO was investigating the incident , a spokeswoman said Saturday . 
`` NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify as we have no reliable sources on the ground , '' NATO 's Oana Lungescu said . 
`` Clearly , if someone fires at one of our aircraft , of course they have the right to defend themselves . '' 
Rebel spokesman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga said opposition fighters had retaken al-Brega after a night of heavy fighting with Moammar Gadhafi 's forces . 
But it was not immediately clear who commanded control Saturday of the coastal city that has now changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of the Libyan war . 
Meanwhile , in Misrata , east of Tripoli , two mortars landed at a medical clinic Saturday evening , causing one death and numerous injuries , said a medical official with the city 's main hospital . 
The doctor , who was not identified for security reasons , told CNN the clinic that was attacked had evacuated patients because of recent attacks , but was being guarded by opposition `` fighters and young people . '' 
One person was killed and 15 injured , said the doctor , who was caring for the wounded . 
Five had serious injuries , including head and chest trauma , he said . 
Forces loyal to Gadhafi showed no signs of backing down after officials spurned an opposition cease-fire proposal . 
Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters in Tripoli on Friday that rebels were not `` really serious '' about the offer , which he said included `` silly conditions . '' 
`` They are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people , who are holding up arms , who are tribal , violent , no unified leadership , al Qaeda links , and no one knows who they are . 
If this is not mad , then I do n't know what it is , '' he said . 
`` We will not leave our cities . 
We will not stop protecting our civilians . '' 
His comments came after Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil laid out cease-fire conditions that included freedom of expression for the Libyan people and the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias from western cities . 
Ultimately , he said , the opposition 's goal remains regime change in Libya . 
Ghoga sought to clarify the opposition 's position Saturday . 
`` There is no , and was no , negotiation on a cease-fire with Colonel Gaddafi 's dictatorship , '' he said at a Bengahzi news conference . 
He repeated the opposition demands that Gadhafi halt all military action , end the sieges laid on cities like Misrata and allow free speech and assembly . 
Sources close to Gadhafi told CNN that political solutions are still possible but that the Libyan leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle . 
They said there is still time for dialogue but expressed doubts about who would represent the opposition . 
Any transition , they said , would involve Gadhafi 's second son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and for such a transition to take place there would first have to be an end to the fighting . 
The Libyan sources told CNN that for now , Gadhafi remains confident the regime can withstand any challenge from the rebels . 
U.S. officials claim Gadhafi 's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned airstrikes . 
The dictator 's forces , however , still outnumber rebels by about 10 to 1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , according to Navy Adm. Mike Mullen , the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman .

2011-04-04,"Alleged Libyan rape victim speaks out NEW : Eman al-Obeidy says men used rifles to sodomize her NEW : She says she has tried to leave Libya , but authorities have thwarted her attempts NEW : Her father begs the international community to come to his daughter 's aid Al-Obeidy says she was interrogated for 72 hours after being dragged from a hotel Watch an interview with Eman al-Obeidy , the woman who claims she was raped by forces loyal to Libyan leader Gadhafi , on `` AC360 '' , tonight at 10 p.m. ET . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eman al-Obeidy , the woman who burst into a Tripoli hotel to tell journalists she was beaten and raped by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi last month , is no longer in custody but says she still fears for her life . 
In two telephone interviews with CNN 's `` AC360 , '' al-Obeidy spoke about her alleged abuse . 
At times in tears , at other times defiant , she recalled men pouring alcohol into her eyes and repeatedly using rifles to sodomize her . 
Al-Obeidy said has since been stopped trying to leave Libya and that she has nightmares . 
`` My life is in danger , and I call on all human rights organization ... to expose the truth and to let me leave now . 
I am being held hostage here , '' she said . 
`` They have threatened me with death and told me I will never leave prison again , if I go to the journalists or tell them anything about what 's happening in Tripoli . '' 
Al-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse . 
Interrogators poured water on her face and threw food at her during the relentless questioning , which ended only after she was examined by a doctor to prove she had been raped , al-Obeidy said . 
`` And when the test came , it verified that I was raped and tortured ... then I was freed . '' 
She said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials , who initially called her mentally ill , drunk and a prostitute , have ruined her reputation . 
Al-Obeidy said her spirits and morale are low and that she has nightmares now . 
`` They did not give me a chance to respond , '' she said . 
The attempt to discredit al-Obeidy as a promiscuous , un-Islamic woman ties into the idea of sexual shaming in a conservative Muslim society where it 's commonly believed that a woman who has been raped has lost her honor , said Mona Eltahawy , a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues . 
Woman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces Libyan woman speaks out about rape For a woman in such a society to come forward to claim she has been raped is no small thing . 
`` No one would do that unless they were raped , and especially in a conservative society , '' Eltahawy told CNN . 
Al-Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on March 26 while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . 
She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli , held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . 
`` They had my hands tied behind me , and they had my legs tied , and they would hit me , while I was tied and bite me in my body . 
And they would pour alcohol in my eyes so that I would not be able to see and they would sodomize me with their rifles , and they would not let us go to the bathroom . 
We were not allowed to eat or drink , '' she told CNN 's `` AC360 , '' speaking through a translator . 
`` One man would leave and another would enter . 
He would finish and then another man would come in , '' al-Obeidy said . 
She said another woman being held captive was able to untie her hands and feet , allowing al-Obeidy to escape . 
When CNN saw her in March , al-Obeidy 's legs and face were bruised and she had blood on her right inner thigh . 
Her visible injuries appeared to support her allegations , but CNN could not independently verify her story . 
Government officials tried to subdue her , scuffling with reporters in the process and eventually dragged her away . 
Al-Obeidy said she is no longer in government custody and has spent time with her sister . 
But she said she can not leave the house where she is staying as officials from the police or army will pursue her . 
She said that when she tries to leave the house , officials chase her down and take her to a police station . 
But police do n't know what to do with her since she is not charged with a crime , and she is released . 
Al-Obeidy said she has been abducted by Gadhafi forces three times -- the first time from the hotel , the second time when she tried to escape to Tunisia last week and a third time on Sunday . 
She said the abduction Sunday and accompanying threats were an effort to prevent her from taking her complaints to a police investigations unit . 
In spite of the danger , al-Obeidy said the most important thing to her is that her voice reaches the world . 
`` I would like to direct a word to all the people watching us in America that we are a peaceful people and we are not members of al Qaeda . 
We are a simple people and moderate Muslims -- not extremists -- and we are not asking for anything expect for our freedom and dignity and the most basic human rights which are denied to us , '' she said . 
Her father said Monday he has still not spoken to his daughter and begged the international community to come to her aid . 
`` What is happening to her is wrong . 
What can I do ? 
I have no power to do anything . 
I urge the human rights organizations and all international humanitarian movements to get involved and help us , '' said Atiq Al-Obeidy . 
CNN 's `` AC360 '' spoke with al-Obeidy Sunday and Monday .

2011-04-04,"By the CNN Wire Staff Jones : Goal in Libya is regime change NEW : Rebel fighters , retreating east of al-Brega , report an ambush and mines One person died and 15 were injured in two mortar blasts Sunday , a hospital doctor says NATO says it is investigating a report that rebel fighters were killed in an airstrike Rebel spokesman : Rebel forces went to assess airstrike damage when they were hit Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British diplomats were on the ground in Libya meeting with key figures of the opposition , but no decision has been made by Western allies on whether to arm them , the UK Foreign Office said Sunday . 
`` What we are engaged in is protecting the civilian population in Libya , which we have done with a lot of success ... when people look at what we 're doing in Libya they do have to look at what would be happening if we did n't do what we 'd done over the last few weeks and it would have been a catastrophic situation , '' UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said . 
A spokesperson for the office said the goal of the British diplomatic team is to build on the work of a previous team and to `` establish further information about -LRB- the opposition -RRB- , its aims , and more broadly , what is happening in Libya . '' 
Meanwhile , the United States agreed to extend until Monday the use of its strike aircraft over Libya due to poor weather conditions over the past few days , NATO spokesman Oana Lungescu said . 
`` These aircraft will continue to conduct and support alliance air-to-ground missions throughout this weekend , '' he said . 
The deadly battles in Libya forged ahead Sunday as pro-government forces shelled a medical clinic in the city of Misrata , killing one person and wounding 15 others , a hospital source said . 
The source , a doctor who was not identified for security reasons , told CNN two people were injured by an initial mortar blast . 
The rest of the injured were wounded by a second mortar blast when they went to the scene of the first attack to help victims . 
Zakaria debriefs former Libyan jihadi Mourning a voice for freedom One of the injured is a 14-year-old child who suffered a fractured skull and is in a coma , the doctor said Sunday . 
The clinic that was attacked had evacuated patients because of recent attacks , said another doctor at a Misrata hospital that received the patients . 
But it was being guarded by opposition `` fighters and young people '' who were injured . 
Elsewhere in the city , the sound of heavy shelling was heard coming from the port area , a resident said . 
He said troops supporting Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi surrounded the city , with snipers perched on rooftops of buildings . 
Misrata 's port is under the control of the rebels and is considered the main site of aid for the people in the embattled city . 
A bombing in the port area could prevent aid ships from reaching Misrata . 
Sunday 's events are the latest in the struggle between forces loyal to Gadhafi and opposition members seeking an end to his nearly 42-year rule . 
Rebel fighters retreated east of the oil town al-Brega on Sunday . 
Fighters said there was some sort of ambush , they saw roadside mines and they needed to get more ammunition . 
They regrouped about 30 to 35 kilometers -LRB- 181\/2 to 22 miles -RRB- east of al-Brega . 
NATO is leading international military operations in the country following a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force and the enforcement of a no-fly zone to protect civilians . 
NATO airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters , spokesmen for the Libyan opposition said Saturday . 
Seven others were wounded . 
`` Based on the information we have , they -LRB- the opposition forces who were hit -RRB- heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was , and that 's when they got hit , '' rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . 
`` They were told to stay back , but they jumped the gun . '' 
NATO was investigating the incident , a spokeswoman said Saturday . 
`` NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify , as we have no reliable sources on the ground , '' NATO 's Lungescu said . 
On Saturday , notions of a cease-fire in the country quickly faded as a battle for control continued in al-Brega . 
It was not immediately clear who had control of the coastal city , which has changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of the Libyan war . 
A former Obama national security adviser said Sunday that the international coalition in Libya can not leave the country until Gadhafi leaves power . 
`` The problem is that while everybody wants to see Gadhafi leave , either be removed or leave on his own , that end state is not yet clear , '' Ret . 
Gen. Jim Jones said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' 
`` Unfortunately most people want perfect clarity in a situation where clarity does n't really exist yet . ''

2011-04-04,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : Rebel official complains of lack of NATO air support British foreign secretary says his country wo n't arm rebels Rebel forces say they have al-Brega surrounded Greek foreign minister : `` It is clear that the -LRB- Libyan -RRB- administration is looking for a solution '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan rebels and forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi fought over the cities of al-Brega and Misrata on Monday , as uncertainty lingered whether Western nations would arm the outgunned opposition . 
An opposition officer in al-Brega said Monday that rebel forces had the oil town surrounded from the north , east and west and had been bombarding the area with rockets for much of the afternoon . 
Maj. Miftah Omar Hamzah told CNN that 50 carloads of loyalist forces remained in al-Brega , but he insisted that the Gadhafi troops were on the defensive . 
New al-Brega , a suburban area of the homes of workers at a nearby oil refinery , was partially under rebel control . 
Opposition officers said they were still clearing the area of Gadhafi forces , and a resident fleeing the area told CNN that it is still unsafe . 
There have been no NATO airstrikes in the area for at least 24 hours , he said . 
The perceived lack of airstrikes enforcing a U.N. resolution to protect civilians from Gadhafi 's forces and enforce an arms embargo brought criticism from a rebel spokesman on Monday . 
`` You are supposed to be implementing this resolution and clearly it 's not implemented in Misrata , it 's not implemented in Zintan or Zahwiya , and we 're wondering where are they ? '' 
In Misrata , destruction permeated the city , which has been choked off by pro-Gadhafi forces . 
Rebels , Gadhafi forces clash in oil town Wounded treated on hospital ship The battle for medical aid in Libya How Libyan government treats media An opposition councilman in Misrata told CNN that a tank entered the outskirts of the city about 3 a.m. Monday and headed for the port area . 
Opposition fighters descended on the area and fought for two hours to force the tank to turn back , which it eventually did , the councilman said . 
The councilman said he could hear NATO jets flying overhead Monday afternoon for the first time in 36 hours . 
`` We need a lot of help in Misrata . 
There 's so much death there , '' said Mustafa Abdul Hamali , a 46-year-old taxi driver who lost half a leg . 
`` I was driving in my car with my wife , and my car just blew up . 
I do n't know what happened . '' 
On Monday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague ruled out his country from arming the rebels but said it would provide them telecommunications equipment , given the urgent need on the ground . 
`` We are prepared to supply nonlethal equipment which will help with the protection of civilian lives and the delivery of humanitarian aid , '' he said . 
Libyan rebels have been hampered by a lack of organization and training on heavy weaponry when confronting the better-trained , better-armed forces of Gadhafi , who is under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court . 
`` We were fighting with light weapons , but they had so much more , '' said Khalid Moteridi , 32 , a businessman who was fighting with the rebels when , he said , he was shot twice in the legs by a sniper . 
`` Artillery , mortars , rocket-propelled grenades , anti-tank rockets -- that 's how they were fighting back . '' 
While Hague 's statement seemed to rule out the United Kingdom from arming the rebels , U.S. officials have yet to say whether they will do so . 
Both countries participated in airstrikes to weaken Gadhafi 's military resources before NATO officially took command of the international operation . 
Due to poor weather conditions in recent days , the United States approved a request by NATO to extend the use of some U.S. strike aircraft , NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said Sunday . 
`` This is a short-term extension , which expires on Monday , '' Lungescu said . 
Moteridi said the situation in Misrata has turned dire . 
`` It 's a tragedy by all means , '' he said . 
`` No electricity , no food , no water . 
We 're trapped from all sides by the Gadhafi forces . '' 
A doctor in Misrata told CNN that government forces shelled a clinic , leaving one dead and 15 injured Sunday . 
Last week , a hospital official said 398 people have been killed since the Libyan conflict began last month . 
He feared there were more deaths that his hospital did n't know about . 
Diplomatic efforts to end the crisis seemed no closer to success Monday . 
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini on Monday said proposals outlined by an envoy whom Gadhafi sent to Greece were `` not credible '' and said his country would become the third to recognize the rebel Libyan National Transitional Council as the legitimate international representative of Libya . 
France and Qatar previously granted the rebel council similar status . 
The nature of the message delivered by Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi was not immediately known . 
`` From what the Libyan envoy said , it is clear that the administration is looking for a solution , '' Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said after the meeting . 
He said Obeidi is expected to continue talks in Turkey and Malta . 
Some rebels from Misrata got a bit of a reprieve Sunday when a Turkish hospital ship picked up more than 300 of the wounded fighters . 
Their injuries included amputated limbs , broken bones and shrapnel wounds . 
The ship is destined for the Turkish port of Cesme , where the patients will receive medical attention , opposition officials said . 
It made a stop in the rebel capital of Benghazi to pick up more patients and supplies , and was greeted by cheering supporters of the opposition . 
Men wearing head bandages and eye patches waved back at the crowd . 
West of Benghazi , the tug-of-war for control continued in al-Brega , which has changed hands six times in six weeks between government and opposition forces . 
Rebel fighters retreated east of al-Brega on Sunday , reporting an ambush , roadside mines and a need for more ammunition . 
Over the weekend , opposition spokesmen said 13 rebels were killed when NATO airstrikes hit several vehicles . 
`` Based on the information we have , they -LRB- the opposition forces who were hit -RRB- heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was , and that 's when they got hit , '' rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . 
`` They were told to stay back , but they jumped the gun . '' 
Lungescu , the NATO spokeswoman , said Saturday that NATO was investigating the incident . 
`` NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify , as we have no reliable sources on the ground , '' she said . 
Despite the unyielding conflict , Moteridi , the rebel fighter who was shot twice in the legs by a sniper , said he wo n't give up . 
`` I 'll go back to Misrata when I get better , God willing , and ... Gadhafi and his gangs will be defeated . ''

2011-04-04,"TRIPOLI\/SFAX , Tunisia | Mon Apr 4 , 2011 7:12 pm EDT TRIPOLI\/SFAX , Tunisia -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi are staging a `` massacre '' in the besieged city of Misrata , evacuees said on Monday , as Turkey said it was trying to broker a ceasefire to halt the bloodshed . 
A government spokesman said Libya was ready for a `` political solution '' with world powers . 
He said the country was ready to discuss political reform , but Gaddafi had to stay . 
Libyan TV showed Gaddafi saluting supporters outside his fortified compound in Tripoli late on Monday . 
But some residents of the capital , angered by fuel shortages and long queues for basic goods , began openly predicting his imminent downfall . 
With Libya in chaos , an official in neighbouring Algeria told Reuters that al Qaeda was exploiting the conflict to acquire weapons , including surface-to-air missiles . 
The U.S. State Department said it had raised concerns with the Libyan rebels about the Islamist group obtaining arms in the east of the country , where they are battling Gaddafi 's forces . 
Evacuees from Misrata , the rebels ' last major stronghold in western Libya , described the city as `` hell . '' 
They said Gaddafi 's troops were using tanks and snipers against residents , littering the streets with corpses and filling hospitals with the wounded . 
`` You have to visit Misrata to see the massacre by Gaddafi , '' said Omar Boubaker , a 40-year-old engineer with a bullet wound to the leg , brought to the Tunisian port of Sfax by a French aid group . 
`` Corpses are in the street . 
Hospitals are overflowing . '' 
Misrata rose up with other towns against Gaddafi last month but is the only major one in western Libyan left in rebel hands . 
`` I could live or die , but I am thinking of my family and friends who are stranded in the hell of Misrata , '' said tearful evacuee Abdullah Lacheeb , who had serious injuries to his pelvis and stomach and a bullet wound in his leg . 
`` Imagine , they use tanks against civilians . 
He -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- is prepared to kill everyone there ... I am thinking of my family . '' 
State TV showed live footage of Gaddafi briefly waving to supporters through the roof of a Jeep outside his compound while bodyguards tried to prevent them from mobbing him . 
But in the maze-like lanes of Tripoli 's medieval market , some openly forecast his fall as rebels based in eastern Libya battle his forces . 
`` People from the east will come here . 
Maybe in two weeks , '' said one entrepreneur who asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisals . 
`` But now , people are afraid . '' 
Stalemate on the frontline of fighting in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's circle and the plight of civilians caught in fighting , or facing food and fuel shortages , have prompted a flurry of diplomacy to try to end the civil war . 
Turkey said it was seeking to broker a ceasefire as an envoy from Gaddafi 's government arrived in Ankara from Athens . 
`` Turkey will continue to do its best to end the sufferings and to contribute to the process of making a road map that includes the political demands of Libyan people , '' Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said after the arrival of Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi from earlier talks in Greece . 
Turkey also expected officials of the rebel National Council to visit Ankara soon , Davutoglu told a news conference . 
A Turkish Foreign Ministry official said both sides had `` conveyed that they have some opinions about a possible ceasefire . '' 
Obeidi later also held talks in Malta . 
ITALY SAYS GADDAFI MUST GOT Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , who had spoken to Greek officials after Obeidi 's talks in Athens , dismissed the Libyan message . 
`` A solution for the future of Libya has a pre-condition : that Gaddafi 's regime leaves and is out and that Gaddafi himself and his family leave the country , '' he said . 
In Washington , the U.S. Treasury said it had lifted sanctions against former Libyan foreign minister Moussa Koussa in the hopes that other senior officials would defect . 
-LRB- nWNA5394 -RRB- Koussa fled to Britain last week and Scottish police want to question him over the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing , for which Libya accepted responsibility and paid compensation to relatives of the 270 dead . 
U.N.-mandated air strikes to protect civilians have so far failed to halt attacks in Misrata by the Libyan army . 
At least five people died when Gaddafi forces shelled a residential area of Misrata late on Monday , a doctor said , warning the death toll was likely to keep rising . 
`` The reception in the hospital is full . 
Five people were confirmed killed in the last two hours and five more are in critical condition , '' the doctor , who gave his name as Ramadan , told Reuters by phone from the city . 
Libyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . 
Accounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . 
A Turkish ship that sailed into Misrata to rescue 250 wounded was protected by Turkish warplanes and warships and had to leave in a hurry after thousands pressed forward on the dock , pleading to be evacuated . 
Another ship operated by Medecins Sans Frontieres docked in Sfax with 71 wounded from Misrata . 
In Algiers , a senior security official said that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- , the Islamist group 's regional wing , was getting hold of weapons in Libya . 
The Algerian official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said a convoy of eight Toyota pick-up trucks had left eastern Libya and headed via Chad and Niger to northern Mali , where in the past few days it had delivered a cargo of weapons . 
`` We know that this is not the first convoy and that it is still ongoing , '' the official said . 
`` Several military barracks have been pillaged in this region -LRB- eastern Libya -RRB- with their arsenals and weapons stores , and the elements of AQIM who were present could not have failed to profit from this opportunity . '' 
In Washington , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States had raised concerns with the Libyan rebels . 
`` We are aware of these reports too and it has been one of the topics of our conversation with ... the opposition forces , '' Toner told reporters . 
`` We have made very clear our concerns and they have ... pledged that they will look into it . '' 
Gaddafi says the uprising is fueled by Islamist radicals and Western nations who want to control Libya 's oil . 
The rebels , whose stronghold is in the eastern city of Benghazi , want nothing less than the removal of Gaddafi and his circle . 
The U.N.-mandated military intervention , in which warplanes have attacked Gaddafi 's armor , radar and air defences , began on March 19 and was intended to protect civilians caught up in fighting between pro-Gaddafi forces and the rebels . 
After chasing each other up and down the coast road linking the oil ports of eastern Libya with Gaddafi 's tribal heartland further west , the two sides are stuck around Brega , a sparsely populated settlement spread over more than 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It would have been over two weeks ago had the U.S. not intervened . 
Why will the West not even hear what the Libyan government has to say ? 
We refuse to even talk to him . 
That does n't make much sense to me . 
It 's the same as if I was in a fight with someone and I kept punching them and told them I wanted peace but they had to vanish -LRB- as I kept punching them -RRB- and then when they say , ` ok lets talk about this , we want to compromise . ' 
We follow them up with a big F U. High stand-off technology has limited effects on urban combat . 
The boots-on-the-ground military understand this . 
Misrata is clearly the line in the sand for Gaddhafi , since it only lies about 200 kilos east of Tripoli -- he has to throw everything at the rebels in this location or defeat will be imminent . 
We should finish off targeting the tanks and large artillery and then let the rebels complete their objective . 
Otherwise , we 'll be seen once again as an imperialistic , intervening force which wants oil and a market for western products -LRB- mostly weapons -RRB- .

2011-04-05,"By Barry Neild for CNN Refugees from Ivory Coast rest in a village in southern Liberia in this photo dated March 24 . 
Situations in both Libya and Ivory Coast have prompted international intervention Some analysts say Libya is more of a strategic priority for West because of oil U.S. involvement seen unlikely , as Obama struggles to sell intervention to jaded public -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Violence is escalating in the west African nation of Ivory Coast , where president-elect Alassane Ouattara is trying to oust incumbent Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to leave office after losing an election . 
But the international response -- limited to a U.N. peacekeeping force already deployed there -- has paled by comparison with the U.S. and NATO air strikes targeting forces to Moammar Gadhafi in Libya to prevent attacks on rebels and civilians . 
Ivory Coast : Search for justice Ivory Coast 's Gbagbo negotiating way out Reported massacre in Ivory Coast Are there any similarities to the situation in Libya ? 
Analysts say that there are sharp differences in the problems facing the two countries , with Ivory Coast 's problems evolving over a period of years before coming to a boil in recent weeks compared to Libya 's relatively recent turmoil . 
But , they say , there are humanitarian concerns over the violence in both countries . 
`` The two conflicts are very separate , but what is similar is the potential threat to the civilian population , '' says Phil Clark , a lecturer in Comparative and International Politics at London 's School of Oriental and African Studies , who points out that global intervention in both countries has been focused on protecting hundreds of thousands of people at risk rather than on regime change . 
But , says Gilles Yabi , a West Africa analyst with the International Crisis Group , the situation on the ground is vastly different with Gbagbo -- whom the United Nations and the United States have urged to stand down -- having no access to planes and helicopters like those initially deployed by Gadhafi . 
`` We have to be quite prudent about making comparisons , '' he said . 
What are the differences in international response ? 
Again there are similarities , with both situations prompting U.N. Security Council resolutions mandating international military intervention , albeit on different scales . 
In Libya , aircraft were deployed to attack Gadhafi 's air defenses and to protect opposition rebels and civilians from government troops . 
In Ivory Coast , extra troops were authorized earlier in the year increasing the size of the U.N. peacekeeping force to 11,000 , while France has dispatched 300 military personnel . 
Tom Cargill , an Africa expert at the Chatham House think tank , says U.N.-sanctioned air strikes in the Ivory Coast conflict are unlikely . 
`` The situation has moved quickly with the rebels moving into built up areas , so there has n't been time to get a mandate from the U.N. , but because they are in built-up areas , that kind of intervention probably wo n't be something air forces would consider . '' 
Analysts disagree on the reasons . 
Cargill says the two can not be compared since Ivory Coast has endured years of crisis and a sustained international engagement aimed at finding a political solution . 
Others like Clark point to more strategic factors , not least the fact that Western countries feel over-stretched by Libya and are unwilling to commit to the same level of action in Ivory Coast . 
`` I think Libya has in a sense acted as a kind of deterrent to collective action , '' says Knox Chitiyo , head of the Africa program at the UK 's Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies . 
`` In terms of escalation , -LRB- Ivory Coast -RRB- has been unfortunate in terms of timing , as the world 's attention has been focused on the Middle East and particularly Libya , so the Ivory Coast , which has been a slow-burning crisis , fell off the radar . '' 
Yes , say some analysts . 
As a major oil producer , Libya 's strategic significance is far greater than cocoa - and coffee-producing Ivory Coast , says Clark . 
Libya 's potential as an incubator for Middle Eastern democracy is also an attention-grabber for Western countries , he says . 
`` There is significant concern over Libya 's oil and what that would mean for Western strategic interest and there 's a sense that Libya fits into this wider pattern of democratization and the falling of draconian regimes in North Africa and the Middle East . '' 
Knox adds : `` Oil is seen by the West as a more strategic commodity than cocoa if we 're to be quite blunt . '' 
Is America likely to get involved in the same way it has in Libya ? 
No , says Knox , partly because as he has shown with Libya , President Barack Obama is unwilling to take a leading role in multinational intervention . 
But , he says , this is also because Obama would find it tough to convince a public disillusioned by America 's experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan , particularly given Ivory Coast 's perceived lack of strategic significance . 
`` We 've seen that Obama has had a real problem selling -LRB- intervention -RRB- to the U.S. audience , '' he said . 
Why is France so involved ? 
As Ivory Coast 's former colonial ruler , France not only has experience of working in the country but also appears to feel a duty to do so , pressing for Security Council action and dispatching troops . 
This , says Yabi , creates its own problems as Gbagbo uses the French presence for his own benefit . 
`` Anti-colonial discourse is one of Gbagbo 's political weapons and he is trying to resuscitate that rhetoric against France . '' 
Knox adds that France 's involvement points to a broader campaign by Paris to inject itself into the international arena , as punctuated by President Nicolas Sarkozy -LRB- who is seeking re-election next year -RRB- taking a lead role in urging military action in Libya .

2011-04-05,"By the CNN Wire Staff CNN talks to Libyan opposition leader NEW : Opposition leaders criticize NATO and Turkey , saying rebels need more air support Abdelati Obeidi is Libya 's new foreign minister NATO general : Use of shields and weather have complicated airstrike missions General calls last week 's fatal NATO airstrike on rebel position a tragic accident Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Efforts to prevent forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from attacking civilians have been complicated by weather and the regime 's decision to hide military equipment in populated areas and to use human shields , NATO Brig. Gen. Marc van Uhm said Tuesday . 
Rebel leaders have criticized NATO 's efforts in recent days , saying civilians and rebel forces in Misrata and elsewhere have suffered under hellish attacks from pro-Gadhafi forces , with little evidence of NATO air power overhead . 
`` I am extremely sorry to say this , but NATO truly disappointed us , '' said Gen. Abdul Fatah Younis , the opposition 's top military official . 
`` If NATO wanted to free Misrata , they could have done that a few days ago . '' 
Five people were killed and 24 wounded in Monday clashes between pro-Gadhafi forces and rebels in Misrata , two sources told CNN . 
Gadhafi 's sons floating a deal ? 
Libyan rebels forced to retreat Libyan woman speaks out about rape Alleged Libyan rape victim speaks out Residents have said Gadhafi troops had choked off the city from electricity and access to food . 
`` Every day , life is getting more and more difficult , '' said one resident , who is not being identified for safety reasons . 
`` There are long queues of people for bread and fuel . '' 
Some are not leaving their homes for days at a time , he added . 
`` There are snipers shooting at anything that moves , '' the resident said . 
`` They are controlling the main road leading to outside the city . '' 
Younis said NATO 's concerns about collateral damage are unfounded . 
`` The region where the Gadhafi forces are is not inhabited by civilians . 
Anyway , civilians are being killed every day , including children , women and elderly , '' he said . 
`` If NATO will wait another week , Misrata will be finished . 
No one will be left alive . 
Do they want to wait , and watch them die , and let this crime be a shameful disgrace for the international community forever ? '' 
Van Uhm , chief of allied operations at NATO , defended the organization 's efforts , saying warplanes under NATO command flew 58 strike missions Monday , firing weapons and striking pro-Gadhafi targets on 14 of them . 
He did not immediately have figures for previous days , but NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said the warplanes had conducted 334 strike sorties since taking command of the mission on March 23 . 
`` I think you can safely say the operational tempo continues unabated , '' she said . 
In addition to using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas , pro-Gadhafi forces have begun abandoning heavy military equipment in favor of the same kinds of cars and light trucks the rebels travel in , making it even more difficult for pilots to distinguish rebel convoys from those carrying forces loyal to the regime , van Uhm said . 
Since the effort to enforce the U.N. resolution began in mid-March , airstrikes have taken out about 30 % of Gadhafi 's military capacity , van Uhm said . 
Monday 's airstrikes hit an active rocket launcher in al-Brega , an air defense installation and military vehicles near Misrata as well as ammunition storage facilities , van Uhm said . 
But Gadhafi 's forces appeared to have the upper hand Tuesday in renewed fighting in al-Brega , where rebel forces were staging a panicked retreat under intense artillery bombardment , according to CNN reporters in the area . 
The setback is the latest for a ragtag opposition that has struggled to maintain ground against the better-trained and - equipped Gadhafi forces , and it comes less than a day after rebel commanders said they had the longtime Libyan leader 's forces on the defensive in al-Brega . 
With no end to the war in sight , a source close to the country 's leadership said a Libyan envoy is floating the idea of Gadhafi passing his power to a son -- a notion rebel leaders deem merely cosmetic . 
Under the proposal , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , 38 , would help to usher in reform , the source said . 
However , Saif Gadhafi has become one of his father 's most outspoken defenders since the start of the unrest despite once being perceived as a leading reformer in the Libyan government . 
A proposal to shift power from Gadhafi to his second-oldest son is `` a ridiculous offer , '' said Ali Aujali , a former Libyan ambassador to the United States who now represents the Libyan opposition in Washington . 
`` Libyan people , they decided , and they will not go back at all -LRB- to -RRB- Gadhafi or any member of his family , '' Aujali said . 
`` His sons , they are killers -- they 're just like their father . '' 
Aujali said rebels are willing to offer Moammar Gadhafi and his family safe passage out of Libya in an exchange for an end to the fighting -- but that 's as far as their offer goes . 
Though Gadhafi has shown no signs of appeasing the opposition or relinquishing his power to anyone outside his family , cracks in his armor have surfaced . 
His longtime confidant and foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , recently fled to London and announced his resignation from the Libyan government . 
On Monday , the U.S. Treasury Department lifted the freeze on Koussa 's assets following his split from Gadhafi . 
On Tuesday , Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Khaim confirmed reports that Abdelati Obeidi is the nation 's new foreign minister . 
Rebel spokesman Mustafa Gheriani said while the conflict persists , he remains hopeful for a revolution . 
`` I think the Gadhafi regime is crumbling from within , '' he said . 
`` I think if you look at history , people will always win , and I think victory will be ours . ''

2011-04-05,"WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As leading U.S. senators discuss whether Congress should retroactively approve military operations in Libya , the Senate on Tuesday sidestepped a chance to reassert the war powers of Congress . 
The Senate blocked a vote on a proposal by Rand Paul , a freshman senator and Tea Party Republican , aimed at reaffirming the constitutional authority of Congress to declare war . 
The problem with Paul 's amendment , as seen by many members of the Democratic majority , was that it quoted then-Senator Barack Obama 's words from 2007 in what appeared to be an attempt to embarrass the Democratic president . 
Back in 2007 , Senator Obama told the Boston Globe `` the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- nation . '' 
Paul said he wanted the Senate to endorse Obama 's past words and thus establish that the president had overreached in authorizing the U.S. action in Libya last month without first obtaining Congress ' approval . 
Paul 's proposal was `` too cute by half , '' declared Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday after she joined other senators in voting to table it , 90-10 . 
Paul had trouble getting even his fellow Republicans to support his idea . 
Some said they did n't approve of where he had chosen to offer his war powers amendment -- on legislation to do with small businesses . 
`` I think we need to address Libya , when -LRB- that 's -RRB- the focus , '' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison , a Republican , after the vote . 
Obama briefed leading members of Congress the day before launching attacks on Libya last month , but did not seek debate or vote in Congress , as some lawmakers say he should have . 
Article I of the U.S. Constitution says Congress has the power to declare war . 
But Article 2 says the president is `` Commander in Chief '' of the armed forces . 
This has been a source of friction between the two branches for decades . 
`` I am amazed that this body does not take the time to debate whether we should be in Libya , '' Paul said on the Senate floor Tuesday . 
`` Some say we 'll debate it next week . 
... The debate should occur before we go to war , '' Paul told senators . 
Indeed , leading senators have been discussing for days whether to retroactively authorize U.S. military intervention in Libya . 
But they have n't been able to agree on a draft text . 
`` We do n't know yet -LRB- whether there will be a resolution -RRB- . 
We 're just discussing it informally , '' said Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin , a Democrat who has been supportive of the Libyan intervention . 
`` I think there should be an expression from Congress '' about the war , the Senate 's number two Republican , Jon Kyl , told reporters . 
`` The problem has been getting a consensus on what that is . 
It has n't been easy . '' 
Kyl said Republican Senator John McCain , a supporter of the Libya war , was trying to get agreement with Democrats . 
The House has been waiting to see what the Senate would do , But some lawmakers , like House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard McKeon , a Republican , doubt the House could pass a resolution now that would approve the operation . 
We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It is time to boot these incompetant elite from office with a new constitutional convention . 
The Congress is corrupt and can not be repaired . 
The cronies of the elected congress people are CBA -LRB- Crooked Bankers Association -RRB- that bailed out AIG crooks for $ 180 BILLION and then eliminated the transparency by hiding the $ 263 TRILLION derivative debt from the American taxpayers . 
Rand Paul is loved by the tea baggers so does the tea party care more about Libya then small businesses ? 
I think the senate should take care of more pressing issues then worrying about the past -- are we really at war if we do n't put troop on the ground and do n't try to take out the leader ? 
Also , this was an international effort put forth by the UN Once again all talk and no substance . 
Pand Paul did vote for the action in Libya on 3-1 , thats on record and he can not hide from that . 
Unanimous consent is still a vote in the senate . 
As a fact , most votes in the senate is by unanimous and only when a senator wants to debate or stall or object are there members on the floor to further discuss it . 
Sentor Rand Paul could of even put on hold on the resolution if he wanted to but he did n't . 
In other words , Rand Paul is no different than the rest but now the elections are near and the power grab is coming to head . 
This discussion is now closed .

2011-04-05,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue Apr 5 , 2011 8:50 pm BST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Western powers have destroyed nearly a third of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's military since launching air strikes last month but NATO said it was forced to change bombing tactics because of human shields . 
The besieged city of Misrata , the only big population center in western Libya where a revolt against Gaddafi has not been crushed and which faces army tanks and snipers , is now the priority for NATO air strikes . 
But Libyan rebels on the battlefield complained about what they see as a dropping off in air support and a spokesman in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi said NATO `` disappointed us '' with its slow response that allowed Gaddafi forces to kill people . 
`` Either NATO does its work properly or we will ask the Security Council to suspend its work , '' said Abdel Fattah Younes , head of the rebel forces . 
`` NATO is moving very slowly , allowing Gaddafi forces to advance , '' he told reporters . 
`` NATO has become our problem , '' he said , adding that NATO inaction was allowing the army to advance and letting them kill the people of Misrata `` every day . '' 
As the row erupted over the military campaign , the International Criminal Court said on Tuesday it had evidence Gaddafi 's government had developed plans to crush protests by killing civilians even before the uprising in Libya broke out . 
`` We have evidence that after the Tunisia and Egypt conflicts in January , people in the regime were planning how to control demonstrations inside Libya , '' court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told Reuters in The Hague . 
`` The planning at the beginning was to use tear gas and -LRB- if that failed to work -RRB- ... , shooting , '' said Moreno-Ocampo who is investigating Gaddafi , his sons and close aides and who will be requesting arrest warrants in the coming weeks . 
Protests against the government that began on February 15 swiftly descended into civil war after Gaddafi forces opened fire on demonstrators . 
He then crushed uprisings in Libya 's west , leaving the east and Misrata in rebel hands . 
NATO-led air power is now holding the balance in Libya , preventing Gaddafi forces from overrunning the revolt in the North African desert state but unable for now to hand the rebels outright victory with a stalemate on the desert battlefield . 
NATO took command of operations in Libya from a coalition led by the United States , Britain and France on March 31 and is enforcing a no-fly zone ordered by the United Nations and launching air strikes on Gaddafi forces to protect civilians . 
`` The assessment is that we have taken out 30 percent of the military capacity of Gaddafi , '' Brigadier General Mark van Uhm , a senior NATO staff officer , said in Brussels . 
Over the last day , air strikes around Misrata hit Gaddafi 's tanks , air defense systems and other armored vehicles . 
Near Brega in the east , where intense fighting raged for a sixth day on Tuesday , NATO aircraft struck a rocket launcher . 
Answering earlier criticism by insurgents that air power became less effective with the alliance in control , NATO officials said the presence in Libyan skies was undiminished . 
But Van Uhm said Gaddafi was using civilians as human shields and hiding his armor in populated areas , curbing NATO 's ability to hit targets . 
`` The operational tempo remains , but we have seen a change of tactics -LRB- from Gaddafi -RRB- , '' he said . 
`` When human beings are used as shields we do n't engage . '' 
There were other tactical changes . 
`` They are using more and more trucks and light vehicles ... and they are keeping more heavy equipment like armored vehicles -LRB- hidden -RRB- , '' said Van Uhm , who added that the end result was that Gaddafi was prevented from using heavy armor . 
Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict in the oil producing nation have failed to make progress with the government side offering concessions , but insisting Gaddafi stay in power , and rebels adamant that Libya 's leader for the past 41 years leave . 
After a series of rapid rebel advances followed by headlong retreats , the insurgents held their ground for six days in Brega , putting their best trained forces in to battle for the oil town and keeping the disorganised volunteers away . 
A sustained government bombardment of rockets and mortar bombs , however , pushed the insurgent pick-up truck cavalcade back towards the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , their biggest retreat in several days of inconclusive battles . 
`` Since the day NATO took over the air strikes , we have been falling back , '' said Ziad el Khafiefy , 20 , a rebel fighter . 
`` Gaddafi 's troops are hitting us with Grad missiles , '' said Mabrouk el Majbary , 35 . 
`` Something is wrong ... When the U.S. gave leadership to NATO , the bombings stopped . '' 
The rebels had shown better organization than in past weeks , keeping territory for longer but government troops mounted a sustained assault on Tuesday . 
The rebels are set for a boost with the arrival of a tanker in one of their ports which can carry one million barrels of crude , worth more than $ 100 million , which would be their first shipment since the fighting broke out . 
A Turkish ship arrived at the port of Cesme in western Turkey on Tuesday afternoon carrying 321 injured Libyans after visiting Benghazi and Misrata . 
Sirens wailed as ambulances rushed the injured to nearby hospitals . 
In the capital Tripoli , angered by fuel shortages and long queues for basic goods caused by sanctions and air strikes , some residents began openly predicting Gaddafi 's imminent downfall . 
Stepping up efforts to eradicate symbols of resistance against Gaddafi in western Libya , the army razed a mosque once used by rebels as a command center in Zawiyah . 
The government took reporters to the city to show it was under control . 
`` People are upset , '' said Mohammad , a shopowner . 
`` How can you remove a mosque in a central square just like that ? 
It 's a Muslim country . '' 
`` Do n't you see how tightly controlled we are now . 
Government spies have us surrounded in this city and we are scared to talk , '' said another resident . 
`` Those were revolutionaries and civilians that they killed , they were not gangs or al Qaeda . '' 
Stalemate on the frontline of fighting in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's circle and the plight of civilians caught in fighting or facing food and fuel shortages prompted a flurry of diplomacy to find a solution to the civil war . 
The government has offered concessions . 
Spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said Libya was ready for a `` political solution '' with world powers and offered a `` constitution , election , anything . 
But the leader has to lead this forward . '' 
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi ended a diplomatic shuttle to Greece , Turkey and Malta to set out the government position . 
Libya 's Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa , once a close ally of Gaddafi , has defected to Britain . 
Turkey is expecting an envoy to visit from the opposition in the coming days and is listening to both sides . 
`` Both sides have a rigid stance , '' a Turkish Foreign Ministry official said after Obeidi 's visit . 
`` One side , the opposition , is insisting that Gaddafi should go . 
The other side is saying Gaddafi should stay . 
So there is no breakthrough yet . '' 
There has been talk of Gaddafi staying on as an historic figurehead with one of his sons overseeing a change in Libya towards democracy . 
But many Western leaders see no role for Gaddafi in Libya 's future . 
`` But let 's be clear , when Gaddafi leaves , that is when the real difficulties start and we need to prepare for that , that is bringing the country together again , '' said Sweden 's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt , who was involved in the Balkans conflict .

2011-04-05,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue Apr 5 , 2011 6:40 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The head of Libya 's rebel army has condemned NATO for its slow chain of command in ordering air strikes to protect civilians , saying the alliance was `` letting the people of Misrata die every day . '' 
The besieged city of Misrata , the only big population center in western Libya where a revolt against Gaddafi has not been crushed and which faces army tanks and snipers , is now the priority for NATO air strikes , alliance officials said earlier . 
`` NATO blesses us every now and then with a bombardment here and there , and is letting the people of Misrata die every day , '' Abdel Fattah Younes , head of the rebel forces said in the eastern stronghold city of Benghazi . 
`` NATO has disappointed us . '' 
In reaction , NATO said it was carrying out its mandate . 
NATO took over from a coalition led by the United States , Britain and France on March 31 , putting the alliance in charge of air strikes targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure as well as policing a no-fly zone and an arms embargo . 
NATO had been moving very slowly , allowing Gaddafi forces to advance , Younes said , adding rebels were considering referring the issues with NATO to the U.N. Security Council which authorised its mission . 
`` NATO has become our problem , '' he said . 
A rebel spokesman said Misrata was hit again on Tuesday . 
`` Misrata was shelled with tank fire , artillery and mortars , '' the rebel , called Abdelsalam , told Reuters , adding : `` Unfortunately NATO operations have not been effective in Misrata . 
Civilians are dying every day . '' 
Stalemate on the frontline of fighting in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's circle and the plight of civilians caught in fighting or facing food and fuel shortages has prompted a flurry of diplomacy to find a solution to the civil war in this oil-producing North African desert state . 
Protests against the government that began on February 15 swiftly descended into civil war after Gaddafi forces opened fire on demonstrators . 
He then crushed uprisings in Libya 's west , leaving the east and Misrata in rebel hands . 
NATO-led air power is holding the balance in Libya , preventing Gaddafi forces from overrunning the rebels but unable for now to hand them outright victory . 
`` Either NATO does its work properly or I will ask the -LRB- rebel -RRB- national council to raise the matter with the Security Council , '' Younes , a former interior minister in Gaddafi 's administration who defected , told reporters . 
`` The reaction of NATO is very slow . 
One official calls another and then from the official to the head of NATO and from the head of NATO to the field commander . 
This takes eight hours , '' Younes said , adding : `` Misrata is being subjected to a full extermination . '' 
Asked about Younes 's remarks , NATO spokesman Oana Lungescu said : `` The facts speak for themselves . 
The pace of operations since NATO took over has not abated . 
We have conducted 851 sorties in the past six days ... we are fulfilling our mandate . '' 
Another NATO official said : `` The rebels may not see us . 
We may be 100 or 150 km away . 
We are some distance from where the fighting is going on so the rebels are not aware . '' 
Earlier in the day , NATO had given details of the campaign . 
`` The assessment is that we have taken out 30 percent of the military capacity of Gaddafi , '' Brigadier General Mark van Uhm , a senior NATO staff officer , said in Brussels . 
Over the last day , air strikes around Misrata hit Gaddafi 's tanks , air defense systems and other armored vehicles . 
Near Brega in the east , where intense fighting raged for a sixth day on Tuesday , NATO aircraft struck a rocket launcher . 
Answering earlier criticism by insurgents that air power was less effective with the alliance in control , NATO officials said the presence in Libyan skies was undiminished .

`` The operational tempo remains , but we have seen a change of tactics -LRB- from Gaddafi -RRB- , '' he said . 
`` When human beings are used as shields we do n't engage . '' 
Addressing NATO , Younes said : `` They say they do n't want to bomb in order not to kill civilians . 
The area where Gaddafi troops are does not include civilians . '' 
Abdelsalam in Misrata agreed . 
`` NATO says Gaddafi 's forces are hiding among civilians . 
But we tell them that there are no civilians left in the areas where the Gaddafi forces are positioned . 
We urge them to destroy civilian property to take out the snipers and armed gangs . '' 
After a series of rapid rebel advances followed by headlong retreats , the insurgents held their ground for six days in Brega , putting their best trained forces in to battle for the oil town and keeping the disorganised volunteers away . 
A sustained government bombardment of rockets and mortar bombs , however , pushed the insurgent pick-up truck cavalcade back toward the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , their biggest retreat in several days of inconclusive battles . 
`` Since the day NATO took over the air strikes , we have been falling back , '' said Ziad el Khafiefy , 20 , a rebel fighter , echoing Younes 's comments . 
`` Gaddafi 's troops are hitting us with Grad missiles , '' said Mabrouk el Majbary , 35 . 
`` Something is wrong ... When the U.S. gave leadership to NATO , the bombings stopped . '' 
As the row erupted over the military campaign , the International Criminal Court said on Tuesday it had evidence Gaddafi 's government had developed plans to crush protests by killing civilians even before the uprising in Libya broke out . 
`` We have evidence that after the Tunisia and Egypt conflicts in January , people in the regime were planning how to control demonstrations inside Libya , '' court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told Reuters in The Hague . 
`` The planning at the beginning was to use tear gas and -LRB- if that failed to work -RRB- ... , shooting , '' said Moreno-Ocampo who is investigating Gaddafi , his sons and close aides and who will be requesting arrest warrants in the coming weeks . 
The rebels are set for a boost with the arrival of a tanker in one of their ports which can carry one million barrels of crude , worth more than $ 100 million , which would be their first shipment since the fighting broke out . 
In the capital Tripoli , angered by fuel shortages and long queues for basic goods caused by sanctions and air strikes , some residents began openly predicting Gaddafi 's imminent downfall . 
Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have failed to make progress with the government side offering concessions , but insisting Gaddafi stay in power , and rebels adamant that Libya 's leader for the past 41 years leave . 
Libya has changed tack in the past days , stressing readiness for political reform as well as peace talks with rebels . 
`` All armed militias , if they want a peaceful end to this crisis , they have to give up their arms , and then they are most welcome to take part in the political process , '' Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters in Tripoli . 
Libyan envoy Abdelati Obeidi ended a shuttle to Greece , Turkey and Malta to set out the government position . 
Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa , once a close ally of Gaddafi , has defected to Britain . 
The government said on Tuesday that Obeidi had been appointed as foreign minister . 
Turkey is expecting an envoy to visit from the opposition in the coming days and is listening to both sides .

`` One side , the opposition , is insisting that Gaddafi should go .

Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
The issue is that it is a LIbyan problem . 
, it is not a NATO problem , A UN problem or an American problem . 
When the folks there took up arms against a lunatic they must have known what would result . 
When our President declared that Muammar had to go he put the US into an issue that is not our problem . 
Certainly we all have opinions and deplore the treatment of Libyans , but it is not our fight . 
I agree with '' MACIRA '' the United States should no longer involve itself in these internal fights in the middle east or anywhere else . 
We are not the World Police Force , World Court of Justice or World Welfare Provider . 
This is blood oil , conflict oil no one should be buying any oil from both parties . 
The fact that the guns that are been used to kill the people of Libya have been purchased from oil sales to europe and now its the other way around its just crazy supplying guns to the rebels with blood oil its just crazy .

2011-04-06,"By the CNN Wire Staff Eman al-Obeidy wants humanitarian organizations to come to Tripoli and see the conditions there , CNN 's Nic Robertson said . 
Eman al-Obeidy says she is still recovering , CNN 's Nic Robertson says The Libyan government wants to review Robertson 's interview Al-Obeidy 's mother says , `` Our hope in God is very strong '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eman al-Obeidy , the woman who says forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi raped her , is grateful for support she has received , said CNN 's Nic Robertson , who met briefly with her Wednesday . 
`` She is a very strong lady who told me to thank all -LRB- the -RRB- people who have stopped her case from disappearing , '' Robertson said . 
Al-Obeidy said she had a message for humanitarian organizations : They should come to Tripoli and `` see how life is here , '' he said . 
She said she is still recovering physically from the alleged assault and displayed faded bruises and rope burn marks on her wrists , Robertson said . 
But , she told him , she is unable to leave Tripoli and be reunited with her family and faces abuse whenever she leaves her house , he said . 
The Libyan government is insisting on a review of the interview by a government representative before transmission . 
The review was scheduled Wednesday night , but an apparently imminent airstrike postponed the review until Thursday morning . 
Meanwhile , al-Obeidy 's mother said Wednesday that talking to her daughter by telephone Tuesday night was an emotional experience . 
`` Of course , I felt worse , '' Aisha Ahmad said . 
`` Because she was crying . 
I could n't understand a word because she was crying . 
She even made me cry . '' 
The two women spoke on Tuesday . 
Al-Obeidy told her mother that a court employee pulled a weapon on her when she went to a courthouse . 
The 29-year-old law school graduate burst into a Tripoli hotel last month to tell her story to journalists . 
Authorities rushed her away from the hotel , but she is no longer in custody . 
Still , she told CNN 's `` AC360 '' Tuesday she fears for her safety in Tripoli , which she called a `` large prison . '' 
She said authorities had taken her passport and were not letting her cross into Tunisia . 
Al-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse . 
She has said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials , who initially called her mentally ill , drunk and a prostitute , have ruined her reputation . 
Ahmad , who lives in the eastern Libyan city of Tobruk , said her daughter told her in the call `` she was trapped . 
She said , ` They 're taking me back and forth , interrogating me , hitting me . ' 
She said , ` They want to kill me . 
Help me , come and get me , ' she said . 
` Where are the human rights groups ? ' '' 
Asked how she is coping , Ahmad said , `` Our hope in God is very strong . '' 
She told her daughter Tuesday that the world is praying for her and not to be afraid . 
On whether she has a message for those who might be listening , Ahmad said , `` I want -LRB- President -RRB- Obama and all the Western world to get involved and bring me back my daughter . 
Just bring her back to me . 
I would like to tell the mothers all over the world , and the Arab world , that if something happens to someone , they need to speak out . 
They just need to speak out . '' 
Al-Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on March 26 while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . 
She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli , held against her will for two days and was beaten and raped by 15 men . 
When CNN saw her in March , al-Obeidy 's legs and face were bruised and she had blood on her right inner thigh . 
Her visible injuries appeared to support her allegations . 
Human Rights Watch , in a statement Wednesday , called for Libyan authorities to immediately allow al-Obeidy to leave Tripoli and receive medical care . 
Nadya Khalife , the Middle East women 's rights researcher for the organization , said authorities have further victimized al-Obeidy by refusing to allow her to leave Tripoli .

2011-04-06,"By the CNN Wire Staff Clinton says Gadhafi must step down for bombing to stop Gadhafi asks President Obama to stop NATO 's bombing Ex-U.S. Rep. Weldon to urge Gadhafi to step down , calls for cease-fire Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As rebel and pro-government forces in Libya maneuvered on the battlefield Wednesday , Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi urged U.S. President Barack Obama to end the NATO bombing of his war-torn country . 
Gadhafi made the appeal in a letter to the American president , a senior administration official said . 
But the official said there was `` nothing new '' in the letter , the thrust of which was an appeal for an end to the alliance 's air operations . 
It contained no offers to negotiate or step down , and the official said the administration is n't taking the note seriously . 
Gadhafi asked Obama to stop the `` unjust war against a small people of a developing country '' and said those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al Qaeda , the official said . 
`` We have been hurt more morally than physically because of what had happened against us in both deeds and words by you , '' Gadhafi wrote , according to the official . 
`` Despite all this you will always remain our son . '' 
The strongman expressed hope that Obama wins re-election next year , the official added . 
And he wrote that a democratic society can not be built through missiles and aircraft . 
`` You are a man who has enough courage to annul a wrong and mistaken action , '' the leader wrote to the president . 
NATO accused of not providing support CNN talks to Libyan opposition leader Libyan rebels prepare to export crude Inside the mind of Saif Gadhafi Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO strikes will stop when Gadhafi steps down and leaves the country . 
`` I do n't think there is any mystery about what is expected from Mr. Gadhafi at this time , '' Clinton said . 
The letter came amid diplomatic , economic and military developments in Libya , which remains in a deadly stalemate as pro-Gadhafi forces battle opposition fighters demanding democracy and an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year-rule . 
A British airstrike hit an oil field in the eastern Libyan town of Sarir on Wednesday , causing damage to a main pipeline , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . 
A tanker carrying crude oil left the eastern Libyan port of Tobruk on Wednesday in what was the first known export of oil by the fledgling opposition during the conflict , a sign of optimism for them . 
Rebel fighters and pro-Gadhafi forces have been pushing back and forth between al-Brega and Ajdabiya , while residents in the western city of Misrata are spending their days in fear . 
Also Wednesday , ex-U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon , who met with Gadhafi within the past decade , paid a visit to the Libyan capital with a cease-fire plan and a clear message to the embattled ruler that he must step down . 
Weldon , speaking in an interview with CNN affiliate WPIX-TV in New York , said he planned to meet with Gadhafi and Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim . 
`` It 's a very solemn time because there 's so much at risk here , '' said Weldon , who led a congressional delegation to Libya in 2004 and is visiting Tripoli at Gadhafi 's invitation . 
Weldon is a Republican who represented a suburban Philadelphia district . 
`` I 'm here to tell him face to face it 's time for him to leave . 
It 's time for him to step down , allow the people to take over the government of this country . '' 
There 's been seesaw fighting between pro- and anti-Gadhafi troops between al-Brega and Ajdabiya , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . 
On Tuesday night , Gadhafi forces moved 40 kilometers -LRB- about 25 miles -RRB- from al-Brega to Ajdabiya , and then Wednesday , the rebels pushed them back 10 kilometers -LRB- six miles -RRB- . 
At one point , rebels let loose with barrage of rockets , and they were answered by artillery and mortars . 
`` It moves back and forth , '' Wedeman reported . 
A CNN team saw equipment the rebels did n't have before such as night-vision goggles and two Milan anti-tank missiles . 
Fighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in Benghazi but did n't know their origin . 
Rebel leaders have criticized NATO 's mission to help protect civilians in recent days , saying residents in Misrata and elsewhere have suffered under horrific attacks from pro-Gadhafi forces with little evidence of NATO air power overhead . 
`` I am extremely sorry to say this , but NATO truly disappointed us , '' Gen. Abdul Fatah Younis , the opposition 's top military official , said Tuesday . 
`` Civilians are being killed every day , including children , women and elderly . 
If NATO will wait another week , Misrata will be finished . 
No one will be left alive . 
Do they want to wait , and watch them die , and let this crime be a shameful disgrace for the international community forever ? '' 
NATO Brig. Gen. Mark van Uhm said weather conditions and tactics by Gadhafi regime have hindered their efforts . 
In addition to using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas , pro-Gadhafi forces have started abandoning heavy military equipment in favor of the same kinds of cars and light trucks the rebels travel in , making it difficult for pilots to distinguish rebel convoys from those carrying forces loyal to the regime , van Uhm said . 
NATO is operating under a Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is `` deeply concerned about the deterioriating situation facing civilians in Libyan cities under military attack , '' according to a statement . 
Conditions in Misrata are `` especially grave , '' the statement said , `` with reports of the use of heavy weapons to attack the city , where the population is trapped and unable , as a result of heavy shelling that has continued over several weeks , to receive basic supplies , including clean water , food and medicines . '' 
But residents in Misrata said this week that Gadhafi forces have trapped the city , with snipers shooting indiscriminately . 
Access to food has been hampered . 
`` Normal life is a luxury that we do n't have , '' one resident said . 
`` I have n't taken my family out for four weeks now . 
All schools are closed , my children did n't go to school since the 19th of February . 
All government offices are closed . 
Even dead people are buried without death certificates . '' 
After weeks of relentless fighting , a military victory for either side seems remote . 
A political or diplomatic solution might be the only way to end the crisis . 
Weldon said that in addition to his proposals for Gadhafi 's stepping down , a cease-fire on both sides and the withdrawal of government forces from key cities , he is calling for a halt in further advances by rebel forces ; the creation of a joint interim government run by Libya 's current prime minister and the opposition leader ; unfettered humanitarian access ; and the establishment of a parliamentary commission that would include U.S. , Middle Eastern , European and African politicians helping to establish a new parliament in Libya . 
As for the Gadhafi family , Weldon 's proposals also suggest a possible title for Gadhafi as honorary chairman of the African Union and allowing his second-oldest son , Saif , to stand in elections . 
On the economic front , the tanker with crude oil that left Tobruk was sailing to Qatar , where the oil will be refined , CNN confirmed . 
Final destination of the export is not known at this time . 
The civil war in Libya has severely curtailed oil exports from the North African nation , which produced some 1.6 million barrels per day last year . 
This move symbolizes the opposition 's intent to manage the country 's affairs . 
The U.S. Treasury has frozen more than $ 32 billion in assets held by Gadhafi and members of his regime . 
Asked whether the opposition should be able to have access to those funds , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States `` is well aware there is an urgency , that the Transitional National Council does need funding if it 's to survive , and we 're looking at ways to assist that . '' 
But Toner said he did not know the status of the $ 32 billion .

Al-Obeidy told Aisha Ahmad that a court employee pulled a weapon on her when she went to a courthouse . 
Al-Obeidy , who burst into a Tripoli hotel last month to tell her harrowing story to journalists , told CNN 's Anderson Cooper in an emotional phone interview that the administrative court employee threatened her life . 
`` The people came and started pulling him , '' said al-Obeidy , who related the incident to her mother , also on the phone . 
`` The whole day in the court they were saying we are going to kill this failure who reports on our brigades . '' 
A car took her home , al-Obeidy said . 
`` They do n't want me to go to the court at all . '' 
CNN could not independently verify the 29-year-old law school graduate 's claims . 
Al-Obeidy , who is no longer in custody after authorities rushed her away from the hotel , said she still fears for her safety in Tripoli , which she called a `` large prison . '' 
Alleged Libyan rape victim speaks out Facing threats , al-Obeidy speaks out She told `` AC360 '' that Gadhafi forces took her passport and would not let her cross the border into Tunisia . 
Her mother , Aisha Ahmad , who lives in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk , urged al-Obeidy to return to her parents `` before they kill you . '' 
`` You have Allah with you , you have Allah with you , you have Allah with you , '' Ahmad said . 
`` Do not change your statement . '' 
Ahmad tried to comfort her distraught daughter , saying , `` they lie in the Libyan media . '' 
`` I dream of them trying to kill me , '' said al-Obeidy , who has spent time with her sister and is concerned about the health of her father back home . 
Ahmad told al-Obeidy the world is praying for her and not to be afraid . 
`` I 'm not afraid , '' the daughter replied . 
`` The one thing that really bothers me is that I 'm far from you . 
Nobody is standing by me here in Tripoli . '' 
Asked by Cooper if she were still trying to leave the capital , al-Obeidy said , `` How can I possibly get out of Tripoli when Tripoli is under siege ? 
There are only two ways to get to my family , by way of Tunisia or through the eastern zone and they 're both under siege . '' 
Al-Obeidy , who was encouraged by Ahmad to pray and keep her faith , was grateful for the opportunity to speak with her family . 
`` We 'd like to thank the American people and every person who tried to make my voice heard , '' she said . 
In two previous telephone interviews with Cooper , al-Obeidy spoke about her alleged abuse . 
At times in tears , at other times defiant , she recalled men pouring alcohol into her eyes and repeatedly using rifles to sodomize her . 
Al-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse .

`` British warplanes have attacked , have carried out an air strike against the Sarir oilfield which killed three oilfield guards and other employees at the field were also injured , '' Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . 
There was no immediate official comment from Britain 's Ministry of Defense on Kaim 's comments about the field . 
Earlier , Muammar Gaddafi 's forces unleashed mortar rounds , tank fire and artillery shells on the western city of Misrata on as a French minister said NATO air strikes in Libya risked getting `` bogged down . '' 
Misrata , Libya 's third city , rose up with other towns against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule in mid-February , and it is now under attack by government troops after a violent crackdown put an end to most protests elsewhere in the west of the country . 
Rebels are angry at what they perceive to be a scaling back of operations since NATO took over an air campaign , following an early onslaught led by the United States , France and Britain that at one stage tilted the war in the rebels ' favor . 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Gaddafi forces were making it harder for alliance pilots to distinguish them from civilians by hunkering down in populated areas . 
`` The situation is unclear . 
There is a risk of getting bogged down , '' he said . 
Juppe told France Info radio he would address the issue of tactics shortly with the head of NATO , adding Misrata 's ordeal `` can not go on . '' 
NATO has accused Gaddafi of using human shields to make targeting harder for its warplanes . 
Civil war in the vast North African desert oil producer ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies against his 41-year rule inspired by uprisings that have toppled or endangered other autocrats across the Arab world . 
Stalemate on the battlefield in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's coterie and the plight of civilians ensnared in fighting or running out of food and fuel has spurred a flurry of diplomacy in pursuit of a peaceful solution . 
But such efforts have made little headway , with the rebels adamant that Gaddafi step down while the government , aware of the limitations of Western intervention , has offered concessions hinting at democratization but insists he stay in power . 
In a blow to rebel finances , Gaddafi forces halted production at rebel-held oilfields in eastern Libya , a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday . 
Rebels want to resume exports to raise revenue for their uprising . 
Oilfields in Misla and the Waha area were hit by Gaddafi 's artillery on Tuesday and Wednesday , spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
The Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from Marsa el Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since the uprising began in February , shipping sources said . 
U.N.-mandated air strikes have so far failed to halt attacks by the Libyan army in besieged Misrata , where residents said snipers on rooftops and tanks firing on populated areas of the city have had a devastating effect . 
`` Gaddafi forces have changed tactics and are using human shields in urban areas , including in Misrata , '' Britain 's Foreign Office said on Wednesday . 
The head of Libya 's rebel army has condemned NATO for its slowness in ordering air strikes to protect civilians , saying the alliance was `` letting the people of Misrata die every day . '' 
Juppe said : `` We 've formally requested that there be no collateral damage for the civilian population ... That obviously makes operations more difficult . '' 
But General Abdel Fattah Younes was adamant that Gaddafi was conducting massacres . 
`` Day by day people are dying . 
Hundreds of families are being wiped off the face of the earth . 
Patience has its limits , '' he said . 
Asked whether he found NATO 's argument that it is trying to prevent civilian casualties convincing he said : `` No , it 's not convincing at all . 
NATO has other means . 
I requested there be combat helicopters like Apaches and Tigers . 
These damage tanks and armored vehicles with exact precision without harming civilians . '' 
Libyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . 
Accounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . 
Rebel criticism has put the Western military alliance on the defensive , particularly over Misrata . 
Spokeswoman Carmen Romero said that `` the pace of our operations continues unabated . 
The ambition and the position of our strikes has not changed . '' 
NATO air strikes are targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure but only to protect civilians , not to provide close air support for rebels , much to their dismay , as part of a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N. Security Council . 
Relieving the siege of Misrata was a NATO priority but alliance officials conceded that Gaddafi 's army was proving a resourceful and elusive target . 
`` The situation on the ground is constantly evolving . 
Gaddafi 's forces are changing tactics , using civilian vehicles , hiding tanks in cities such as Misrata and using human shields to hide behind , '' Romero told reporters in Brussels . 
Misrata on Wednesday faced another heavy bombardment . 
`` There was firing on three fronts today , the port in the east , the center around Tripoli street and the west of the city . 
Mortars , tank fire , and artillery were used to shell those areas , '' rebel Abdelsalam said by telephone . 
`` NATO needs to either launch a serious operation to take out all the heavy armored vehicles , including tanks ... If they do n't want to do this , they should provide us with weapons to do it ourselves . '' 
Meanwhile , living conditions in Misrata worsened . 
`` People are panicking , especially women , children and old people . 
Most people left their homes for safer areas and found refuge with other families , '' Abdelsalam said , adding : `` No fruit and vegetables have been available in Misrata for over 25 days , bread is also difficult to find . 
People are scared to go out because of the snipers and the indiscriminate shelling . 
The upper-hand is still with Gaddafi 's forces . '' 
On the eastern battlefield , Libyan rebels regained ground in a new advance on the oil port of Brega on Wednesday but also accused NATO of inaction hindering their quest to oust Gaddafi . 
Ill-trained insurgents thrust westwards to the contested port , recovering mostly desert terrain lost in a pell-mell retreat from Gaddafi 's superior firepower the day before . 
Rebels returning to the tiny outpost of al-Arbaeen , midway between Brega and their frontline town of Ajdabiyah , spoke of rocket duels close to Brega 's port as both sides strived to end a ragged stalemate in the civil war . 
Rebel Idriss Abdel Karim complained of a lack of NATO support . '' 
-LRB- Government forces -RRB- are scared of NATO air strikes but NATO does n't bomb anything in the first place , '' he said . 
`` There have been no air strikes . 
We hear the sound , but they do n't bomb anything , '' said Hossam Ahmed , another rebel . 
`` What is NATO waiting for ? 
We have cities being destroyed . 
Ras Lanuf , Bin Jawad , Brega , and Gaddafi is destroying Misrata completely , '' said Ajdabiyah resident Said Emburak . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Younes needs to stop the politics game playing with NATO . 
Let s look at the facts . 
NATO , as requested , has taken command for operations in the Libyan theater . 
Having assumed control it is apparent NATO is interpreting the requirement to protect civilians in a narrower vein to of the coalition ; that is NATO acts where there is an imminent danger to the unarmed civilian population , as opposed to initiating pre-emptive strikes against Qaddafi forces . 
Regrettably much as the West fears and seeks to avoid civilian deaths it is unavoidable . 
The truth is that as a rule , in any conflict civilians will die . 
We continue to lie to ourselves and the public by perpetuating the lie . 
The best that any force can hope to achieve is to limit as far as possible the loss of innocent life . 
Instead of blaming NATO for civilian deaths , Younes needs to question the position of the opposition for the safety of innocent civilians . 
If he truly believes what he professes , that is , that his first priority is the unarmed civilian population , then he as leader of the opposition should call a halt to operations . 
If on the other hand , his aim is free and open representative government for the people , then his needs to recognize the reality of the situation on the ground , and work with NATO to minimize casualties , as opposed to undermining the NATO effort . 
Where is the United States , The Airforce pilots are better trained then other pilots around the world . 
A lot of Pilots around the world apply for trainning in the United States . 
As for the disaster that is going on in Misrata , `` DAFFY '' should n't be allowed to go off into exile . 
That Sick Person -LRB- DAFFY -RRB- should be bought before the World Courts and found guilty , Then Hung by the neck until very dead , the only problem is this faith is an easy way for all the killings over 42 year that him and his sons commited for there amussment . 
Also , Hang his Sons . 
Back to Misrata , United States how long are you going to sit on the side lines while the Blood of Misrata is stainning our Flag . 
Get back into the fight , you know that we can make a differents . 
The USA just ca n't win . 
If we bomb Gaddafi 's military and accidentally hit civilians -LRB- who were allegedly placed near military targets by the enemy -RRB- we are evil and careless ; if we do n't bomb them we are n't helping out even though we `` should '' . 
When we hand over operations to NATO , people complain that they do n't blow stuff up as efficiently as we had been doing . 
Meanwhile , it 's our taxes paying for most of this , during a time when the Federal government is close to shutting down for lack of funds due to them being wasteful and inefficient . 
I am glad that we threw our UN vote towards helping the rebels , but I wish we were less gung-ho about sending our military around the world . 
I have a bad feeling that my taxes are going to pay for rebuilding yet another foreign country instead of paying off our national debt or -LRB- gasp -RRB- improving our own situation . 
This discussion is now closed .

2011-04-06,"WASHINGTON | Wed Apr 6 , 2011 2:23 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A U.S. envoy has arrived in Benghazi to get to know Libya 's opposition and discuss how the United States might help it meet its financial needs , a U.S. official said on Tuesday . 
The visit by Chris Stevens , former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Tripoli , reflects a U.S. effort effort to deepen its contacts with the rebels , who are fighting a civil war against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces . 
NATO-led air power is now maintaining the balance in Libya , preventing Gaddafi 's forces from overrunning the seven-week old revolt but unable for now to hand the rebels outright victory . 
While U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has twice met a top representative of the opposition Transitional National Council , the United States has not followed its allies France and Italy in formally recognizing it . 
U.S. officials say they are still gathering information about the opposition and its objectives , though they have praised its stated commitments to democracy and human rights . 
`` He 's there to get to know the members of the TNC , '' said the U.S. official . 
Stevens will explore what kind of political system the opposition plans to build and how to help it pay its bills given international sanctions on Libya , the official said . 
`` We recognize the TNC will need funds to keep it going and we are looking at ways in which we can assist , '' he said , saying the idea was to look at doing so `` through the international community given the challenges that sanctions pose . '' 
Stevens also plans to discuss humanitarian assistance for the opposition , he said . 
At the Pentagon , Press Secretary Geoff Morrell noted discussions within the U.S. government about the possibility of providing `` non-lethal '' support for the rebels , including medical supplies or personnel protection vehicles . 
Libya is the latest Arab nation this year to witness a popular uprising against an authoritarian leader , following demonstrations that toppled Tunisia 's Zine al-Abedine Ben Ali in January and Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak in February . 
Anti-government protests that began on February 15 descended into civil war after Gaddafi 's forces fired on demonstrators . 
Gaddafi put down uprisings in Libya 's west , leaving the east , including Benghazi , and the city of Misrata in rebel hands .

2011-04-07,"Saadi Gadhafi sent a car to bring Eman al-Obeidy to his office Al-Obeidy is not intimidated by his presence , calls him a humble man She says she wants to clear her name , smeared on state TV Story of rape and torture became known after she burst into a Tripoli hotel Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It has been almost two weeks since Eman al-Obeidy burst into our hotel in Tripoli , desperate for the world to hear her story of rape and torture . 
We had been trying since then to interview her in person and were finally able to speak to her Wednesday , against the explicit wishes of the Libyan government . 
`` You should not be allowed to do this , '' government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told me . 
The interview with al-Obeidy was facilitated by Gadhafi 's son Saadi and was subject to a government review . 
We asked al-Obeidy if she would be willing to come to Saadi Gadhafi 's office . 
She agreed and Gadhafi sent a car to pick her up . 
She and Gadhafi met privately before our interview , the first time the two had met . 
Gadhafi appeared shocked afterward . 
He commented on her strong character and willingness to challenge him when they disagreed . 
He and his press assistant sat in on the 30-minute CNN meeting . 
Some of the time , we were alone with her . 
She came dressed in ornate black robes and with her head covered . 
She called herself an ordinary citizen , a good Muslim who is conservative in her social outlook . 
She spoke with clarity and exuded strength through the conversation , adamant about clearing her name she said Libyan state media had smeared . 
Al-Obeidy interview ` did n't come easy ' Al-Obeidy : Tripoli is a prison `` Everything they said about me is a lie , '' she said . 
`` I am well-educated unlike the way the Libyan TV portrayed me . 
I come from a good family , regardless of what they said , I am also not mentally challenged like they said . 
Just because I raised my voice and talked to the media they blamed me and questioned my sanity . 
Nonetheless , I want my rights , even without the media . '' 
She spoke of her abduction , of how she was taken to one of the residences of Moammar Gadhafi 's soldiers . 
They were drunk , she said . 
They tied her up , beat and raped her . 
Her bruises had faded , but I could still the see the evidence of her agony around her wrists . 
She said in the height of her trauma , she took pictures with the camera on her mobile phone , lest people should not believe her later . 
`` People have blamed me for showing my body , '' she said . 
`` I was depressed and there was no way to show people how I was tortured . 
I was brutally tortured to the point of them entering weapons inside me . 
They would also pour alcohol in my eyes . '' 
She said the men who tortured her are still free , without punishment . 
Later Saadi Gadhafi told me : `` The people responsible for raping her should face charges . 
She is a strong woman . '' 
Al-Obeidy , a law school graduate , spoke her mind in Gadhafi 's presence and gave no indication that she was intimidated by him , even when she accused the Libyan authorities of lawlessness , brutality and lies . 
`` I wanted to defend myself because they did not even give me the right to respond , '' she said . 
I wanted to defend myself because they did not even give me the right to respond . 
That Saturday , when she tried to speak to journalists at the Rixos Hotel , she was dragged off the property . 
She was beaten and thrown in jail . 
Her phone was confiscated . 
At one point , al-Obeidy told her fellow citizens in eastern Libya and the besieged western city of Misrata to be strong . 
After the interview was over , Gadhafi objected to that line . 
Al-Obeidy agreed to Gadhafi 's request that it be cut from the video , but only with full disclosure that those 10 seconds had been removed . 
Ibrahim , the government spokesman , reviewed my interview and objected to its tone , to the questions I asked and to the overall content . 
But Saadi Gadhafi overruled his objections . 
We were asked not to broadcast the interview until another government representative was able to look at it . 
At the insistence of the Libyan government , we delayed transmission of the video for 18 hours , waiting for word . 
But the review never came and in the end we were cleared to air almost all of al-Obeidy 's words with the exception of the 10 seconds that she agreed to cut . 
She was thankful for Saadi Gadhafi 's efforts to make the interview happen . 
`` He was a humble and understanding man , and he treated me well , '' she told me . 
`` He said that he will take my case and help me . '' 
She had asked for three things -- that she be allowed to clear her name , that her abusers are prosecuted and that she be reunited with her family in the eastern city of Tobruk . 
Al-Obeidy took the first steps to getting one of her wishes . 
She is counting on Saadi Gadhafi to help her with the other two .

2011-04-07,"By Dugald McConnell and Brian Todd , CNN U.S. firms getting rich from Gadhafi ? 
Documents show Moammar Gadhafi waged PR campaign to burnish his image The Monitor Group , a Boston-based consulting firm , was paid $ 3 million a year Monitor senior partner : `` We were not working for Gadhafi , we were working for Libya '' Other U.S.-based firms were hired by Gadhafi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just a few years before becoming embroiled in fighting a rebellion , Moammar Gadhafi was spending millions of dollars a year to wage a PR campaign to burnish his global image as a statesman and a reformer , confidential documents show . 
The mercurial leader hired The Monitor Group , a Boston-based consulting firm , to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think-tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to Libya for lectures , discussions and even personal meetings with Gadhafi starting in 2006 . 
According to a 2007 memo from Monitor to Gadhafi 's intelligence chief , the campaign was to `` enhance international understanding and appreciation of Libya ... emphasize the emergence of the new Libya ... -LRB- and -RRB- introduce Muammar Qadhafi as a thinker and intellectual . '' 
The price : $ 3 million a year , plus expenses , for work that included consulting , briefings , analyses , and a steady stream of high-profile visitors to Libya -- at least one a month . 
The memos were posted online by the National Conference of the Libyan Opposition . 
Eamonn Kelly , senior partner at Monitor Group , is heading an internal investigation at the company . 
He said the visitors program was only a small part of a wider campaign to help build civil society there . 
The vast majority of the work , he says , was bringing leadership training and expertise to the country , aimed at `` promoting reform , improving the economic prosperity of the country and the people , modernizing the government and helping to heal the very broken civic society . '' 
Working in a war zone `` We were not working for Gadhafi , we were working for Libya , '' Kelly said . 
After one year 's work , a 2007 memo from Monitor touted the results , including a dozen high-profile visitors , ranging from interviewer David Frost to eminent professors such as Francis Fukuyama , fellow at Stanford University . 
Monitor also took credit for positive media coverage and also highlighted a half-dozen positive articles written by some of the participants they sponsored . 
For example , Benjamin Barber wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post entitled , `` Gaddafi 's Libya : An Ally for America ? '' 
and Andrew Moravcsik wrote a piece for Newsweek called , `` A Rogue Reforms . '' 
Although the firm had vowed to `` provide operational support for publication of positive articles on Libya , '' there is no indication any of the pieces were written at Monitor 's behest . 
Instead , participants in the program who were reached by CNN say they believed they were being paid for the lectures they gave and the coaching they offered . 
They said they agreed to go because they were curious about Libya at a time when the regime had taken several positive steps toward the West and appeared to be open to change . 
Barber points out that , starting in 2003 , Libya `` came out of the cold , thanks to Bush administration overtures : rejoined the West , made war on al Qaeda , started imprisoning al Qaeda warriors , paid -LRB- Lockerbie -RRB- reparations of $ 1.3 billion , and yielded their weapons of mass destruction . '' 
Barber , an academic whose books on political theory include the best-seller `` Jihad vs. McWorld , '' says he now wants to see Gadhafi driven out . 
But at the time , Barber tells CNN , `` we thought -- and I think Monitor thought -- it was an opportunity to work at internal reform . '' 
Another distinguished academic , Harvard 's Joseph Nye , said he accepted the paid trip because `` Gadhafi appeared to be changing his policy -- and introducing new ideas could further reform . '' 
After he met with Gadhafi , Nye wrote an op-ed for The New Republic that contained both praise and criticism of the dictator . 
Several other program participants , including Fukuyama and Harvard 's Michael Porter , did not reply to inquiries . 
Some of the visitors who met with Gadhafi later briefed American officials , according to Monitor 's memo , including `` senior officials in the White House '' and `` senior government officials '' at the State Department and the Department of Defense . 
The Monitor Group claimed that after they sponsored two trips to the country by former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle , `` he briefed Vice President Dick Cheney on his visits to Libya . '' 
Cheney did not reply to an inquiry , but Perle told CNN he did not `` brief '' Cheney on Libya and that it was mistaken to suggest he had done any lobbying for Libya . 
Still , the possibility that paid visitors later briefed government officials has Paul Blumenthal at The Sunlight Foundation , a watchdog group that has reported on the subject , saying the firm should have registered as lobbyists for a foreign country . 
`` They really wanted these intellectuals to be able to influence policy on Libya , '' says Blumenthal , to talk to `` people in the State Department and the Defense Department , and really convey the sense that Libya was this great new open place . '' 
The Monitor Group has received an inquiry about their work from the Justice Department , according to Kelly . 
Monitor also offered , in a letter to Gadhafi 's intelligence chief , a 22-page proposal for a book about Gadhafi , to be produced for $ 2.9 million in fees and expenses . 
The book would cover Gadhafi 's `` ideas on democracy , '' the outline said , `` so that the West gains a more accurate and balanced understanding of his actions and ideas . '' 
The book project never reached fruition , and Monitor said in a statement the proposal was `` a poor decision '' that the firm seriously regrets . 
But overall , said Kelly , Monitor stands by its main body of work . 
`` We were working in a very different period , a period of promise , and we are heartbroken that that period clearly has ended . '' 
Monitor was n't the only U.S. firm that Gadhafi 's regime engaged . 
In 2008 , as Monitor 's work was coming to a close , Libya retained a more traditional lobbying firm , The Livingston Group , led by former U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston , R-Louisiana . 
The firm lobbied State Department officials and members of Congress for Libya in 2008 and 2009 , introducing Libya 's U.S. ambassador to dozens of members of Congress . 
Libya initially paid the firm $ 200,000 a month , but after a year , the billings had dwindled to just $ 30,000 a month . 
Livingston declined an interview with CNN , but he told CNN affiliate WVUE that he ended the contract shortly after Gadhafi gave a hero 's welcome to Lockerbie conspirator Abdelbeset al Megrahi upon his release from prison in Scotland . 
`` That was just a bridge too far , and we had to fire the client , '' he said . 
And before Livingston and Monitor , starting in 2004 , Gadhafi 's government engaged lobbyist Randa Fahmy Hudome during its effort to get Libya accepted in the international community and taken off the State Department 's list of nations who sponsor terrorism . 
Libya paid her firm more than $ 3 million over the course of three years , she said . 
`` It certainly was not about money , '' Hudome said . 
`` It was about national security principles at the time . ''

2011-04-07,"Series of explosions in Libyan capitol NEW : Four journalists will be released , senior Libyan government official says Former GOP congressman still hopes to meet with Moammar Gadhafi Airstrikes on rebels in the east kill four , a rebel commander says Four journalists , including two Americans , are seized by pro-Gadhafi forces Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Airstrikes killed four people in eastern Libya on Thursday , an opposition general said , and rebel fighters and civilians made a wild , panicky retreat from a major city . 
Aircraft fired missiles on a rebel formation between al-Brega and Ajdabiya on the eastern Libyan battlefront , witnesses told CNN Thursday , an act that left the opposition wondering whether NATO aircraft conducted mistaken airstrikes on the forces they are trying to protect . 
It 's unclear whether Libyan aircraft or NATO fired the missiles , but there have n't been Libyan air force planes in the skies for some time because NATO aircraft have established a no-fly zone . 
NATO said it 's looking into the strikes but did n't say who carried it out . 
In a statement , it said that hostilities between al-Brega and Ajdabiya have `` been fierce for several days . 
The situation is unclear and fluid with mechanized weapons traveling in all directions . '' 
`` What remains clear is that NATO will continue to uphold the U.N. mandate and strike forces that can potentially cause harm to the civilian population of Libya , '' NATO said . 
Gen. Abdul Fattah Yunis , commander of rebel forces , told reporters of the `` unfortunate setback . '' 
Working in a war zone The planes fired on 20 rebel tanks near al-Brega Thursday morning , Yunis said . 
Gadhafi 's troops moved forward after the attack , causing the opposition to pull back . 
Several of the tanks were destroyed . 
The general said he wanted some answers from NATO on whether it or Gadhafi planes made the strike . 
If the latter , Yunis said , NATO should have prevented that by enforcing the no-fly zone . 
He added that the rebels had notified NATO of the tank movement and of their presence . 
`` There is no tension between us and NATO ; this is a war situation and we understand that mistakes are made , '' Yunis said . 
Two soldiers and two medics died in the airstrike . 
Fourteen people were injured and six are missing , Yunis said . 
Witnesses said the rebel fighters saw an airplane and thought it was from NATO , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . 
Later , the plane returned and fired several missiles and then made another strike . 
Ambulances responded , and the injured people were taken to a hospital in Ajdabiya . 
A few hours after the strikes , civilians and rebels , fearing an approach by pro-Gadhafi forces , retreated from Ajdabiya , with hundreds of civilian cars and trucks loaded with rocket launchers and ammunition headed out of town in the direction of the opposition headquarters in Benghazi . 
Tanks were reportedly part of the column of vehicles . 
The Gadhafi regime 's persistence in the face of NATO forces has frustrated and angered opposition leaders , who say they are not getting traction despite the alliance 's no-fly zone and air cover . 
NATO said weather conditions and tactics by the Gadhafi regime , such as using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas , have hindered its efforts . 
If the latest bombing run were a NATO strike , rebels said it would have been the second in a week 's time . 
Last week , airstrikes hit rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters in the al-Brega area , a spokesman for the Libyan opposition said . 
The strikes come amid a deadly stalemate between pro-Moammar Gadhafi forces and rebel fighters , diplomatic maneuvering to end the conflict and blunt doubts about the potency of the opposition forces . 
Asked whether rebel fighters can push into Tripoli and oust Gadhafi , Gen. Carter Ham , U.S. Africa Command 's chief , told senators at a hearing Thursday , `` I would assess that as a low likelihood . '' 
Also Thursday , a senior Libyan government official said four detained journalists are in government hands and are safe . 
They will be brought to Tripoli and released , but the timing is uncertain , the official said . 
GlobalPost , an international news website , said pro-Gadhafi forces detained one of its freelancers and three other journalists . 
They had been taken Tuesday night on the outskirts of al-Brega , said Peter Bouckaert , director of emergencies for Human Rights Watch . 
On the diplomatic front , a former U.S. lawmaker who has been trying to meet with Gadhafi told CNN `` The Situation Room '' that Friday will be his last opportunity . 
Curt Weldon has said he will tell the leader to step aside and take other measures to end the bloodshed . 
A former Republican U.S. House member from suburban Philadelphia , Weldon has been to Libya before in his work as a congressman . 
He said he came to the country this time with `` a small private delegation . '' 
Weldon said he has met with other Libyan officials , including the prime minster and Gadhafi 's son , Saadi , conveying the Obama administration 's stance on the crisis and reinforcing the importance of an immediate cease-fire monitored by the United Nations to protect civilians . 
`` I 'm here only because I want to avoid war , '' Weldon told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . 
`` I do n't want to see American soldiers killed , and I do n't want to see more innocent Libyans killed , '' he added . 
Fighting has raged across the country . 
Rebel fighters and pro-Gadhafi forces have been pushing back and forth between al-Brega and Ajdabiya . 
In the capital , Tripoli , four explosions were heard , and two aircraft could be seen overhead Thursday . 
Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim described the Thursday airstrikes as heavy and `` really intensive . '' 
He said the strikes hit `` military academies around Tripoli where students and teachers work . '' 
A British airstrike hit an oil field in the eastern town of Sarir on Wednesday , causing damage to a main pipeline , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . 
But NATO 's operation in Libya denied responsibility , saying such blame reflects the desperation of the Gadhafi regime . 
`` We are aware that pro-Gadhafi forces have attacked this area in recent days , which resulted in at least one fire at an oil facility north of Sarir , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's Operation Unified Protector . 
`` We have never conducted strike operations in this area because his forces were not threatening civilian population centers from there , '' Bouchard said . 
`` The only one responsible for this fire is the Gadhafi regime , and we know he wants to disrupt oil getting to Tobruk . '' 
Meanwhile , violence continues in the western city of Misrata . 
Ham said the `` regime has a significantly degraded ability to continue to attack civilians '' and Misrata is a `` notable exception . '' 
`` The opposition forces have held an area in the northeastern portion of the city , in the port . 
And frankly , the port has been operating to get some relief , '' he said . 
`` But the regime forces are and remain active in the city against civilians . '' 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said conditions in Misrata are `` especially grave , '' citing `` reports of the use of heavy weapons to attack the city , where the population is trapped and unable , as a result of heavy shelling that has continued over several weeks , to receive basic supplies , including clean water , food and medicines . '' 
The World Food Programme said one of its humanitarian vessels loaded with food , medical supplies and doctors has reached the port of Misrata , providing what it called a `` lifeline '' for trapped civilians . 
`` This is a breakthrough for the U.N. humanitarian operation in Libya and allows us to reach tens of thousands of people who are caught in one of the fiercest areas of conflict , '' said WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran . 
`` It is vital that we get these relief supplies to the vulnerable . ''

2011-04-07,"WASHINGTON | Thu Apr 7 , 2011 6:35 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A stalemate appears to be emerging in Libya between rebels and forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi but the United States should not make any decision to arm the rebels without knowing more about them , a top U.S. general said on Thursday . 
The comments at a Senate hearing by General Carter Ham , who led the coalition air campaign before Washington handed over command to NATO , is likely to stoke debate in the United States about the next steps in Libya . 
President Barack Obama has ruled out sending ground forces to the North African oil-exporting nation and top administration officials have stressed the limits of American involvement in what could become a protracted civil war . 
Obama has called for Gaddafi to leave but has insisted the United States will not use military force to oust him . 
Senator John McCain , a Republican who is pushing for greater U.S. involvement , grilled Ham about the risks of Gaddafi staying in power . 
Asked by McCain whether he believed the situation could be described as a stalemate or an emerging stalemate , Ham said : `` I would agree with that at present on the ground . '' 
Ham , head of the U.S. military 's Africa Command , later acknowledged that the likelihood of a stalemate was higher now than before the United States passed control of the air campaign to NATO on March 31 . 
`` So right now we are facing the prospect of a stalemate , which then means Gaddafi remains in power , '' McCain said . 
`` Which then means that we will then have a very , very serious situation with Mr. Gaddafi in the future if he remains in power , particularly given his past record . '' 
The debate underscored tensions within Washington about how to best influence events in Libya , where poorly trained rebels are outgunned by Gaddafi 's loyalist forces despite a coalition air campaign . 
Asked by Senator Lindsey Graham how the war would end , Ham said : `` I think it does not end militarily . '' 
He said there was a low likelihood that rebels would be able to fight their way to Tripoli and oust Gaddafi by force . 
`` That 's a very honest answer . 
I would assess -LRB- the chance -RRB- as almost impossible , '' replied Graham , a Republican . 
But Washington has also been reluctant to firmly side with the rebels , citing concerns that extremists might be among their ranks . 
A U.S. commander recently said that intelligence detected `` flickers '' of a possible al Qaeda presence among the rebels , and an Algerian official said al Qaeda had acquired some arms in Libya . 
Ham renewed that cautious line on Thursday . 
`` We would need , I think , necessarily to be careful about providing lethal means to a group unless we are assured that those U.S.-provided weapons would not fall into the hands of extremist organizations , '' Ham said . 
He cited the stated intent of al Qaeda 's North Africa arm , al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- , to aid the opposition . 
`` It has been very difficult to ascertain whether that intent to support the opposition with AQIM personnel has actually materialized in anything on the ground , '' Ham said . 
`` We 're watching that for indications of that very clearly . '' 
Ham defended the work of NATO in the face of criticism by the head of Libya 's rebels , who condemned the alliance this week for its slow chain of command in ordering air strikes to protect civilians . 
A NATO air strike on Thursday killed at least five rebels near the Libyan port of Brega . 
It was the second time in less than a week that rebels had blamed NATO for bombing their comrades by mistake .

Full Article Libya says NATO air strike hits major oil field TRIPOLI | Thu Apr 7 , 2011 4:03 am IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya said a U.N.-mandated British air strike had hit its major Sarir oilfield killing three guards and damaging a pipeline connecting the field to a Mediterranean port . 
`` British warplanes have attacked , have carried out an air strike against the Sarir oilfield which killed three oilfield guards and other employees at the field were also injured , '' Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . 
There was no immediate official comment from Britain 's Ministry of Defense on Kaim 's comments about the field . 
Earlier , Muammar Gaddafi 's forces unleashed mortar rounds , tank fire and artillery shells on the western city of Misrata on as a French minister said NATO air strikes in Libya risked getting `` bogged down '' . 
Misrata , Libya 's third city , rose up with other towns against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule in mid-February , and it is now under attack by government troops after a violent crackdown put an end to most protests elsewhere in the west of the country . 
Rebels are angry at what they perceive to be a scaling back of operations since NATO took over an air campaign , following an early onslaught led by the United States , France and Britain that at one stage tilted the war in the rebels ' favor . 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Gaddafi forces were making it harder for alliance pilots to distinguish them from civilians by hunkering down in populated areas . 
`` The situation is unclear . 
There is a risk of getting bogged down , '' he said . 
Juppe told France Info radio he would address the issue of tactics shortly with the head of NATO , adding Misrata 's ordeal `` can not go on '' . 
NATO has accused Gaddafi of using human shields to make targeting harder for its warplanes . 
Civil war in the vast North African desert oil producer ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies against his 41-year rule inspired by uprisings that have toppled or endangered other autocrats across the Arab world . 
Stalemate on the battlefield in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's coterie and the plight of civilians ensnared in fighting or running out of food and fuel has spurred a flurry of diplomacy in pursuit of a peaceful solution . 
But such efforts have made little headway , with the rebels adamant that Gaddafi step down while the government , aware of the limitations of Western intervention , has offered concessions hinting at democratisation but insists he stay in power . 
In a blow to rebel finances , Gaddafi forces halted production at rebel-held oilfields in eastern Libya , a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday . 
Rebels want to resume exports to raise revenue for their uprising . 
Oilfields in Misla and the Waha area were hit by Gaddafi 's artillery on Tuesday and Wednesday , spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
The Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from Marsa el Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since the uprising began in February , shipping sources said . 
U.N.-mandated air strikes have so far failed to halt attacks by the Libyan army in besieged Misrata , where residents said snipers on rooftops and tanks firing on populated areas of the city have had a devastating effect . 
`` Gaddafi forces have changed tactics and are using human shields in urban areas , including in Misrata , '' Britain 's Foreign Office said on Wednesday . 
The head of Libya 's rebel army has condemned NATO for its slowness in ordering air strikes to protect civilians , saying the alliance was `` letting the people of Misrata die every day '' . 
Juppe said : `` We 've formally requested that there be no collateral damage for the civilian population ... That obviously makes operations more difficult . '' 
But General Abdel Fattah Younes was adamant that Gaddafi was conducting massacres . 
`` Day by day people are dying . 
Hundreds of families are being wiped off the face of the earth . 
Patience has its limits , '' he said . 
Asked whether he found NATO 's argument that it is trying to prevent civilian casualties convincing he said : `` No , it 's not convincing at all . 
NATO has other means . 
I requested there be combat helicopters like Apaches and Tigers . 
These damage tanks and armored vehicles with exact precision without harming civilians . '' 
Libyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . 
Accounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . 
Rebel criticism has put the Western military alliance on the defensive , particularly over Misrata . 
Spokeswoman Carmen Romero said that `` the pace of our operations continues unabated . 
The ambition and the position of our strikes has not changed '' . 
NATO air strikes are targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure but only to protect civilians , not to provide close air support for rebels , much to their dismay , as part of a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N. Security Council . 
Relieving the siege of Misrata was a NATO priority but alliance officials conceded that Gaddafi 's army was proving a resourceful and elusive target . 
`` The situation on the ground is constantly evolving . 
Gaddafi 's forces are changing tactics , using civilian vehicles , hiding tanks in cities such as Misrata and using human shields to hide behind , '' Romero told reporters in Brussels . 
Misrata on Wednesday faced another heavy bombardment . 
`` There was firing on three fronts today , the port in the east , the center around Tripoli street and the west of the city . 
Mortars , tank fire , and artillery were used to shell those areas , '' rebel Abdelsalam said by telephone . 
`` NATO needs to either launch a serious operation to take out all the heavy armored vehicles , including tanks ... If they do n't want to do this , they should provide us with weapons to do it ourselves . '' 
Meanwhile , living conditions in Misrata worsened . 
`` People are panicking , especially women , children and old people . 
Most people left their homes for safer areas and found refuge with other families , '' Abdelsalam said , adding : `` No fruit and vegetables have been available in Misrata for over 25 days , bread is also difficult to find . 
People are scared to go out because of the snipers and the indiscriminate shelling . 
The upper-hand is still with Gaddafi 's forces . '' 
On the eastern battlefield , Libyan rebels regained ground in a new advance on the oil port of Brega on Wednesday but also accused NATO of inaction hindering their quest to oust Gaddafi . 
Ill-trained insurgents thrust westwards to the contested port , recovering mostly desert terrain lost in a pell-mell retreat from Gaddafi 's superior firepower the day before . 
Rebels returning to the tiny outpost of al-Arbaeen , midway between Brega and their frontline town of Ajdabiyah , spoke of rocket duels close to Brega 's port as both sides strived to end a ragged stalemate in the civil war . 
Rebel Idriss Abdel Karim complained of a lack of NATO support . '' 
-LRB- Government forces -RRB- are scared of NATO air strikes but NATO does n't bomb anything in the first place , '' he said . 
`` There have been no air strikes . 
We hear the sound , but they do n't bomb anything , '' said Hossam Ahmed , another rebel . 
`` What is NATO waiting for ? 
We have cities being destroyed . 
Ras Lanuf , Bin Jawad , Brega , and Gaddafi is destroying Misrata completely , '' said Ajdabiyah resident Said Emburak .

2011-04-07,"AJDABIYAH , Libya | Thu Apr 7 , 2011 6:34 pm EDT AJDABIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels fighting to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi said five of their fighters were killed when NATO planes mistakenly bombed a rebel tank column near the contested port of Brega in eastern Libya . 
In Washington , the head of U.S. Africa command told a Senate hearing the United States should not provide arms to the rebels without a better idea of who they were . 
Asked if there was an emerging stalemate in the seven-week-old conflict , General Carter Ham replied : `` I would agree with that at present , on the ground . '' 
In rebel-held eastern Libya , wounded rebels being brought to a hospital Ajdabiyah said their trucks and tanks were hit on Thursday by a NATO air strike outside Brega . 
NATO said it was investigating an attack by its aircraft on a tank column in the area along the Mediterranean coast on Thursday , saying the situation was `` unclear and fluid . '' 
The fighting for Brega , the only active front , has dragged on for a week and has entered a daily pattern of advances back and forth with neither side making major gains . 
Medical workers carried blood-soaked uniforms from hospital rooms in Ajdabiyah , gateway to the insurgent stronghold of Benghazi in the east , after wounded fighters were ferried back from Brega . 
`` It was a NATO air strike on us . 
We were near our vehicles near Brega , '' wounded fighter Younes Jumaa said from a stretcher at the hospital . 
Nurse Mohamed Ali said at least five rebels were dead . 
`` NATO are liars . 
They are siding with Gaddafi , '' Salem Mislat , one of the rebels , said . 
A rebel commander said it appeared to be a case of `` friendly fire '' and said it did not cause tension with NATO although the rebels wanted an explanation . 
Rebels had brought about 20 tanks out of storage and were advancing with them along the coastal desert strip that divides Ajdabiyah and Brega when they were hit , he said . 
`` We would assume it was NATO by mistake , friendly fire , '' Abdel Fattah Younes told a news conference in Benghazi , speaking through an English translator . 
It was the second time in less than a week that rebels had blamed NATO for bombing their comrades by mistake . 
Thirteen were killed in an air strike not far from the same spot on Saturday . 
Rebel spokesmen told Reuters Gaddafi forces killed five people and wounded 25 in an artillery bombardment of the isolated and besieged western city of Misrata on Wednesday . 
The barrage forced the temporary closure of Misrata 's port , a vital lifeline for supplies to besieged civilians , the spokesmen said . 
Misrata , Libya 's third city , rose up with other towns against Gaddafi in mid-February and has been under siege for weeks , after a violent crackdown put an end to most protests elsewhere in the west of the country . 
A rebel spokesman told Reuters that people in Misrata were crammed five families to a house in the few safe districts , to escape a rain of mortar shells from Gaddafi forces which have subjected them to weeks of sniper and artillery fire . 
Two rebel spokesmen reported fighting on a key road to the city 's port as government forces tried to advance . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern about deteriorating conditions for civilians in Misrata and Zintan in the west , and Brega in the east . 
He said the situation in Misrata was particularly grave with the city under heavy bombardment and shortages of food , water and medical supplies . 
Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was working on a `` road map '' to end the war in Libya which would include a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Gaddafi 's forces from some cities . 
Turkey has held talks with envoys from Gaddafi 's government and representatives of the opposition . 
A rebel spokesman said later the rebels rejected talks with Gaddafi and demanded he leave power . 
Sweden said its warplanes operating from Sicily took part in NATO operations against Gaddafi on Thursday , the first combat sortie by the Nordic country 's air force since the early 1960s . 
The civil war has cut Libyan oil output by 80 percent , a senior government official said on Thursday , as rebels and Gaddafi 's forces traded exchanged accusations over who had attacked oil fields vital to both sides . 
Rebels say government attacks on three different installations in the east have halted production of the oil they desperately need to finance the uprising against Gaddafi . 
The government 's Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters the British air force had damaged an oil pipeline in a strike against the Sarir oilfield which killed three guards . 
NATO denied the alliance carried out any air strikes in the Sarir area and said forces loyal to Gaddafi were responsible for an attack which started a fire in the oilfield . 
Shokri Ghanem , chairman of the government National Oil Corporation , told Reuters on Thursday the country 's production had fallen to 250,000 to 300,000 barrels per day compared with 1.6 million before the uprising . 
The Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from the port of Marsa el-Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday , apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since their uprising began in February . 
Oil traders said the cargo , vital to fund the uprising , was headed for China . 
After reported advances by Gaddafi forces from Brega toward Ajdabiyah during the day , both sides appeared to have withdrawn within their secure lines by nightfall , following a familiar pattern . 
A senior Treasury official said Washington had frozen more than $ 34 billion of Libyan assets as part of sanctions against Gaddafi and his top officials . 
European governments had also frozen a substantial amount he said . 
`` Mr. Gaddafi knows what he must do , '' Clinton told a news conference with Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , reiterating calls for a ceasefire , the withdrawal of his forces from cities they have stormed and his departure from Libya . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It is morally incorrect to support a rebellion , whose leaders one does not know , whose aims one is not sure of , I mean how would it turn out if say the rebels turned out to be Al Qaeda ? 
I dont know if they are , maybe they are all very nice people , but so was Qaddafi when he first took power . 
This is an ill conceived mission that makes no sense at all . 
Gaddafi and some people say that NATO is killing innocent civilians and it has to stop because it is unacceptable . 
For some reason I do n't hear anyone saying that someone has to stop Gaddafi because he is using Human Shields and killing innocent civilians now and for 41 years for his and his sons amussment . 
What has to happen is that NATO needs to find a way aroung Gaddafi 's tactics and save the rebels that are being killed in Misrata and around Libya before it 's too late . 
All the rebels want is to be free of a tyrant and to live in a Democratic country . 
The other day I saw a picture of a little girl in Misrata with a severe wound caused by Gaddafi 's fighters firing wildly into Misrata . 
Tell me is a little girl no more then ten years old a rebel fighter or an innocent civilian , now who is killing innocent civilians , I believe Gaddafi 's govenment fighters are killing more innocent civilians then NATO by a far amount . 
This is an Unconstitutional war that we have no right being in . 
When will Obama be held accountable for this war ?

A doctor who had been at the front among rebel ambulance crews said they were hit by a government rocket attack immediately after the air strike . 
One medical worker was killed . 
The air strikes have paradoxically caused the stalemate , grounding Gaddafi 's air force and preventing him from landing a knockout blow .

2011-04-07,"TRIPOLI | Thu Apr 7 , 2011 1:49 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Walking down a Tripoli street with a bag full of freshly baked bread , a Libyan man frowned when he saw crowds of children chanting the praises of Brother Leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
As explosions from what appeared to be NATO air strikes echoed in Tripoli , hundreds of children were taken by bus to a square outside a United Nations office , given green flags of Gaddafi 's revolution and told to shout anti-Western slogans . 
`` The children were brought here . 
This is their education . 
They shout all day instead of studying , '' said the man , shaking his head . 
He said he always supported Gaddafi but was upset with the authorities allowing Libya to descend into civil war . 
`` Cameron is a problem , he is bombing Libya , '' he said , in a reference to Britain 's part in the NATO campaign against Libya . 
`` But this is a problem too , '' he added , pointing at the children . 
Gaddafi has been in power for more than four decades and two generations have grown up under his iron rule . 
In a country with a median age of about 24 , most Libyans have known no other leader . 
A rebellion in the east may have emboldened Libyans there to speak about democratic change , but here in Gaddafi 's stronghold his personality cult still weighs heavily on people 's minds . 
His portraits , usually showing Gaddafi in military uniform with rays of light shining behind him , adorn many houses . 
Soldiers , their heads wrapped in green turbans , patrol the city . 
State television plays patriotic songs and broadcasts images of Libyan tanks rolling through the desert . 
Dancing under the watchful eye of teachers and government minders , hundreds of children chanted `` Down , down USA '' and set off firecrackers outside the gates of the U.N. office . 
Some held gold-framed portraits of Gaddafi . 
Adults encouraged children to kiss the leader 's image in front of television cameras . 
Outside coffee shops , passersby clutching steaming cups stopped to watch the procession with bewilderment . 
Most children seemed indifferent to their task . 
For them , Gaddafi 's dominance is no novelty in a country where they have to study his Green Book of aphorisms as part of their curriculum . 
While the propaganda machine works overtime to prop up the image of a strong state , weeks of conflict and Western air strikes seemed to have loosened Gaddafi 's hold on people 's minds . 
Even during the most tightly controlled events , dissent is always evident . 
People are talking about change with varying degrees of openness , saying it is time for Gaddafi to go . 
`` People need to hope for change , '' a bookshop owner said quietly on a recent visit . 
`` Nothing more needs to be said . '' 
Ali , owner of a clothing shop , said he could not forgive a government that had given orders to shoot its own people during peaceful anti-government protests in February , a chain of events at the start of the uprising that led to the war . 
`` I used to love Gaddafi but many people have died , '' he said . 
`` It changed everything . 
Business was good before February . 
We can not live like this . 
Things have to change . '' 
On the surface , Gaddafi 's influence is still strong in Tripoli . 
People avoid eye contact with foreign journalists . 
`` Sarkozy , Cameron , Obama killer for petroleum , '' says an English-language banner in central Green Square . 
At al Fatah university , the picture was much the same . 
Hundreds of students , some draped in green flags head to toe , were taken by bus into the campus from all around Tripoli to celebrate Gaddafi 's rule on Thursday . 
`` We love Gaddafi . 
We hate the world , '' shouted one high school student . 
`` We want to kill our enemies . '' 
"
2011-04-08,"That which has been obvious for some time now is finally being officially acknowledged : Libya 's power struggle is stalemated , and is likely to remain that way on the basis of the current level of NATO commitment . 
That was the grim assessment in congressional testimony Thursday by General Carter Ham , the U.S. commander who led the initial phases of the operation ... Ham 's testimony made clear that if they wanted to topple Gadhafi 's regime - a stated objective of the key players in the military campaign , Britain , France and the U.S. even if not necessarily through the military campaign - NATO powers , first and foremost the United States , would have to invest more military resources than they are currently doing . 
Ham acknowledged that it would probably require the insertion of foreign ground forces to decisively turn the tide right now - the rebels have proven no match for Gadhafi 's forces , who have them largely pegged back in their eastern strongholds . 
He said the U.S. would have to consider whether to send in troops . 
But escalating Western direct involvement in Libya remains unlikely , at best , for a number of reasons : 1 . 
It 's patently clear , by now , that Libya is in the throes of a civil war - even if the majority of Libyans detest Col. Gadhafi , it 's patently clear that a sizable minority is passionately committed to his regime and willing to fight for it . 
The strength of the regime on the ground has been underestimated , and the power of the rebellion overestimated . 
There 's no quick and easy military solution here . 
The U.S. has until now made clear that it sees limited national interests at stake in Libya , envisaging its role as that of supporting a European-led intervention . 
But the Europeans appear ill-equipped to escalate the air war , much less launch a ground war to topple Gadhafi . 
The `` pottery barn rule '' still applies : If it took a Western ground invasion to topple Gadhafi , the Western powers would be forced to own the outcome , which could be extremely messy . 
The dynamics among and between the various armed groups that would survive a regime collapse - from pro Gadhafi militias , tribal formations , and various factions of a rebel army that is anything but coherent - are barely understood , and there 's no real state left with institutions that could absorb and reconcile these groups . 
It may have been recognized by Italy , France , Qatar and Kuwait as the sole legitimate government of Libya , but the Transitional National Council based in Benghazi does not even pretend to be a truly representative national body . 
Knocking out the regime now through the application of Western military force would create a vacuum that would very likely suck in foreign troops to maintain order and oversee the building of a new Libyan state from scratch . 
Sure , President Obama would take some licks domestically if he fails to decisively topple Gadhafi , but he hardly wants to run for reelection having committed U.S. troops to a third nation-building mission in the Muslim world . 
UN Security Council Resolution 1973 , which provides the legal authority for foreign militaries to protect Libyan civilians , ca n't be translated into a regime-change operation without jeopardizing the alliance . 
Key NATO members such as Germany and Turkey oppose escalation , and Ankara is pressing hard for a cease-fire . 
Stretching the permissions afforded by Resolution 1973 would also jeopardize future international cooperation on humanitarian interventions . 
-LRB- Russia and China may not have voted for this , but they enabled it by refraining from wielding their veto power at the Security Council ; if they believe NATO used the authorization as a pretext to pursue regime-change , they may not easily be persuaded to allow future humanitarian interventions . 
Whatever Arab support exists for the current operations is likely to rapidly erode if it involved sending in foreign troops - remember , even the rebels themselves loudly opposed that idea in the early days of the rebellion . 
What the West needs to do is meet it 's moral obligations and withdraw completely from Libya 's civil war and let the chips fall where they may even if that means a victory for Qaddafy 's forces . 
April 8 , 2011 at 10:07 am | Reply We often talk about protecting civilian lives as if those who oppose kadhafi in Libya are the only lives that matter . 
I want to remind everyone that in any country just like here in USA , those opposing a government loudly is hardly the minority . 
Scores of people do n't have an opinion , do n't care , or are benefiting from the system without political engagement -LRB- eg , Wall Street Bankers are not equal to tea party -RRB- . 
It was irresponsible of those rebels to start a war , risking lives and ki , lling , , , yes ! 
killing innocent people trapped between their ambitions and those of the government , without proper logistics . 
War is not a game , and we of all people shouldn ' t give other countries and their citzens the impression that it is a game . 
It may be for Haliburton and other war merchants and arms sellers , but it is a game that takes lives . 
The war route should never be better than the ballot box . 
cutting handicaped , elderly and the help for those in need in our country to `` help '' rebels in other countries is stupid . 
Paying our debt and taking care of our own is n't . 
April 10 , 2011 at 3:36 am | Reply America and Europ is giving ambitious politicians and adventurists around the world the idea that war takes you straight to power with the support of US and UN . 
THat is a fake and deliberately destructive Idea . 
I am an opposition to the present government , but would never take up arms to defend my ideas or wishes . 
I would rather work to reform the system . 
It 's hard work , even more so where democracy is not a regular thing . 
Oppositions in new countries or non democratic countries what ever that is , are impatient . 
They want to change things yesterday . 
Those who voted for Obama , Blacks who marched with Martin Luter King , ... Slaves , nerver saw the Justice and equal opportunity they wanted . 
They are still not fighting America . 
Why do we encourage such behavior in other countries ? 
Remember here we call those people terrorists . 
April 10 , 2011 at 4:04 am | Reply The `` limited '' involvement is not working so time to cut and run . 
Let the other Muslim nations come in and protect civilians , rebels , whatever if they wish to . 
Otherwise let them kill each other and which ever dictator ends up in power just means we are back to where we were before it started . 
Which was a Libya which was of no national or strategic importance to the U.S. April 8 , 2011 at 12:05 pm | Reply The Qaddafi forces are to be evicted from specified rebel areas `` by any means necessary '' according to President Obama . 
That would include rebel tanks or other rebel armor . 
NATO should replace the equipment destroyed plus better communications gear , instantly if possible . 
Additional air strikes against Qaddafi killers would help . 
Qaddafi supporter areas can be encircled with no bombardment and\/or killing of qaddafi civilian supporters . 
Rebel forces must only jail captured Qaddafi fighters for trial . 
Make rebels UN\/NATO peacekeepers . 
In Qaddafi areas murdering civilians grows . 
April 8 , 2011 at 12:19 pm | Reply Do you honestly believe what you just posted or are you trying to be funny ? 
NATO has no business nor any right for that matter , even to be in Libya ! 
April 8 , 2011 at 2:34 pm | Reply Our Military is stretched thin , why ca n't NATO round up some Mercenaries to aid the rebels and help them fight , use some of Ghaddafi 's frozen assets to fund it ?? April 8 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | Reply It is no good to escalate the conflict in Libya . 
Let the Libyans solve the military stalemate and determine the outcome of this critical situation themselves . 
April 8 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | Reply Actually it is the so-called `` rebels '' who are in the minority , and very likely are even a small minority in the eastern part of the country . 
This is , of course , not what the mainstream media , including Al Jazeera , wishes to be known . 
April 8 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | Reply Where to you get your facts ? 
I think a thirst for freedom is probably in the hearts of the majority of Libyans just as is the case the Egyptians , etc. . 
I base my facts on the self-evident truth that all men and women of this world basically want to be free . 
April 8 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | Reply Thank you , Eugene . 
Your comment is very enlightening since even I did n't know that but I still firmly believe that the `` rebels '' are aspiring to replace Mohammar Qaddafy some pro-Western stooge . 
April 8 , 2011 at 7:52 pm | Reply What Nato need to do is create a no-mans-land between Benghazi and Tripoli for a period of say 5 years ... nothing can enter that no-mans-land during that period of time . 
At the same time apply continued rigid sanctions against the Qaddafi regime and let the East freely trade and grow . 
Insist that the East creates a government and a new constitution and holds free and democratic elections . 
If Eastern Libya complies , then the no-man 's zone is maintained until they ask for it to be removed . 
a no-fly-zone would also be maintained over the west . 
This would pretty much force Qaddafi 's hand . 
And no NATO ground troops would enter Libya . 
April 8 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | Reply We do n't know the degree of repression that the Libyans are currently experiencing under Qaddafi so it is imposable to estimate the percentage of those Libyans under Qaddafi 's rule that would prefer to be free of him . 
April 8 , 2011 at 6:45 pm | Reply I think we should let the opposition have some aircraft and helicopters with attack capability and replace the tanks and rocket launchers , that have been destroyed , since the conflict began , and replace them as they are lost due to hostile action . 
This could include training , to use the equipment and communication equipment to talk to NATO aircraft to reduce friendly casualties . 
They have trained helicopter pilots that could learn to fly a Huey Cobra in days in some cases , weeks in others . 
Older model , A10 's flown by Libyan 's could be just what they people of Libya need to level the playing field . 
I 'm sure that these older , yet serviceable aircraft could be used to get effect against the Moammar Qaddafi military . 
Most of which are mercenaries and former criminals or committed criminal acts against the civilian population since Qaddafi took over in a coup 42 years ago . 
The opposition deserves the chance to succeed and the world needs to assist them in their endeavor , freedom from tyranny does not come without loss of life . 
America , fought for 4 years with the loss of thousands of lives both military and civilians , to win it 's freedom from England .

NEW YORK | Fri Apr 8 , 2011 6:25 pm BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Brent crude jumped to a 32-month high above $ 125 on Friday as commodities climbed in unison on a weaker dollar after attacks on Libyan oil fields made long-term supply cuts more likely . 
Brent was poised for a fourth consecutive weekly gain , and its 5 percent rise would be the largest percentage rise since the week to February 25 . 
In addition to the Libyan conflict , ongoing unrest in the Middle East and bomb attacks intended to postpone Nigerian elections added to oil supply concerns . 
Brent crude for May rose $ 2.71 to $ 125.38 a barrel by 11:50 a.m. -LRB- 4:50 p.m. British time -RRB- , having hit $ 125.79 , the highest front-month price since August 2008 . 
U.S. crude rose $ 1.43 to $ 111.73 after earlier reaching $ 111.90 , the highest intraday price since September 2008 . 
U.S. crude trading volumes lagged Brent near midday Friday in New York . 
U.S. crude volumes the previous two weeks were the lowest weekly volumes for 2011 . 
`` Troubles in Libya mean Gaddafi has caused damage to the Sirte basin , which has about two-thirds of their oil . 
There 's dollar weakness and some very large fund action piling into the market in oil and base metals , '' said Rob Montefusco , an oil trader at Sucden Financial . 
Libya 's civil war has cut its normal output of 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- by 80 percent to between 250,000 and 300,000 bpd , according to a senior government official . 
NATO leaders have acknowledged the limits of their air power , with analysts predicting a drawn-out conflict . 
Libya 's fellow OPEC member Nigeria , which produces 1.9 million bpd , postponed parliamentary elections again in some areas , although polls will go ahead in most of the country on Saturday as planned . 
`` Upcoming elections in Nigeria have already seen an uptick in violence in the oil rich states of Akwa Ibom and Balyesa , with any loss in Nigerian crude -LRB- similar in quality to Libya -RRB- likely to put further pressure on light-heavy differentials , '' said Barclays Capital analyst Amrita Sen. Crude prices rallied in step with gains across the commodities markets , where gold hit a record high , driven by a weaker dollar and a positive global outlook despite Portugal 's request for a bailout earlier this week . 
A weaker dollar often lifts dollar-denominated commodities because they become attractive as a hard-asset inflation hedge and demand can be stoked by cheaper prices for consumers using other currencies . 
`` New investment flows at the start of the quarter are driving oil and gold this morning , with the strong rise over the past week attracting trend followers and more fund money , '' said Michael Guido , director of hedge fund energy sales at Macquarie Bank in New York . 
`` The uptrend is still very much intact , with key technical levels being taken out . '' 
The surge in oil prices is stoking inflationary concerns worldwide due to the potential adverse impact on economic growth and the risk of demand destruction .

NEW YORK | Fri Apr 8 , 2011 6:26 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil prices surged the most in three weeks on Friday , with Brent jumping $ 4 a barrel to a 32-month high as a sinking dollar triggered a fresh rush of fund buying across the commodities spectrum . 
U.S. crude topped $ 113 but trailed Brent , which closed out its best weekly gain since February . 
Deepening violence in Libya and concerns about unrest in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria lent new impetus to a rally that is threatening to crimp global growth and add to growing inflation concerns . 
Analysts said Friday 's sharp gains in oil , wheat , copper and gold -- while stocks slipped -- stemmed from a big wave of second-quarter investment . 
Oil drew extra support from fears that the war in Libya was starting to inflict lasting damage on the oil sector . 
`` Troubles in Libya mean Gaddafi has caused damage to the Sirte basin , which has about two-thirds of their oil . 
There 's dollar weakness and some very large fund action piling into the market in oil and base metals , '' said Rob Montefusco , an oil trader at Sucden Financial . 
ICE Brent crude for May rose $ 3.98 to settle at $ 126.65 a barrel , highest settlement since July 2008 . 
It reached $ 126.91 in post-settlement trading . 
U.S. crude rose $ 2.49 to settle at $ 112.79 . 
It reached $ 113.20 post-settlement , the highest intraday price since September 2008 .

`` The uptrend is still very much intact , with key technical levels being taken out . '' 
Brent 's 14-day Relative Strength Index , a technicians ' measure to gauge whether a contract is overbought or oversold , approached 80 -- a level only hit three times before and never surpassed , according to Reuters data . 
U.S. crude trading volumes above 600,000 lots neared the 30-day average , rebounding from late March when activity hit the lowest this year . 
In addition to the Libyan conflict , investors eyed protests in top oil exporter Saudi Arabia and unrest in Syria , Yemen and attacks intended to interfere with elections in OPEC-member Nigeria , which produces 1.9 million barrels per day of oil . 
Libya 's civil war has cut the normal output of 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- by 80 percent to between 250,000 and 300,000 bpd , according to a senior government official . 
NATO leaders have acknowledged the limits of their air power , with analysts predicting a drawn-out conflict .

Higher oil prices which will raise the price of gas which will push more people into driving those cheap electric that you 'll never see him drive . 
I guess he was n't kiding when he said he did n't mind $ 4.00 a gallon gas since the price of gas has doubled since he has been in office . 
If Libya produces something like 1.8 % of world supply , how is it that the price of oil is spiking by 50 % ? 
@ProudWesterner , you hit the nail on the head . 
Just look at the headline ; `` Oil hit a 32-month high above $ 124 Friday after attacks on Libyan oil fields raised the prospect of long-term supply cuts , with commodities in general rising on optimism global economic recovery will fuel demand . '' 
Two key words there being `` prospect '' and `` optimism '' . 
Nothing has actually happened yet but speculators are \* guessing \* something might so prices go up .

2011-04-09,"WASHINGTON | Sat Apr 9 , 2011 11:46 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Libyan opposition group is asking the United States for immediate access to frozen assets of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to pay for humanitarian needs in rebel-held areas . 
Ali Aujali , who resigned in February as Libya 's ambassador to the United States and now heads Libya 's most prominent rebel organization , in a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the humanitarian conditions have deteriorated in areas held by the rebels . 
Rebel groups seeking to overthrow the Libyan leader have been fighting pro-Gaddafi forces in a civil war ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies . 
Aujali , in the letter dated Thursday , said his group , the transitional national council , `` needs immediate access to the Gaddafi regime 's frozen assets in U.S. financial institutions to meet the basic needs of the Libyan people . '' 
The United States has frozen more than $ 34 billion in assets as part of sanctions against Gaddafi and his top officials . 
The Treasury Department on Friday added five senior officials -- Libya 's prime minister , finance minister , oil minister , internal security director and Gaddafi 's chief of staff -- and two entities controlled by Gaddafi 's children to its sanctions blacklist . 
Obama administration officials have said they were looking into whether some of the frozen cash , securities and other financial instruments could be used to aid the Libyan rebel effort .

NEW : A cease-fire , including an end to airstrikes , is thought to be part of talks NEW : The African Union group on Monday will hold talks with rebel leaders The rebels have recaptured Ajdabiya NATO says Gadhafi 's forces are using civilians as human shields Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , in negotiations with the African Union , has agreed in principal to a deal that would end the conflict in the nation he 's ruled for 42 years , South African President Jacob Zuma told reporters Sunday . 
Negotiations remained under way Sunday night between Gadhafi and the African Union delegation . 
Details of the agreement were not available , though it is believed to include an immediate ceasefire in the nearly two-month long war between Gadhafi 's forces and those fighting to unseat him . 
In his comments , Zuma also discussed an end to NATO airstrikes aimed at enforcing a no-fly zone and targeting Gadhafi 's troops . 
After staying overnight in Tripoli , the African Union delegation will fly Monday to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi to meet with opposition leaders there . 
Gadhafi visits school in Tripoli New NATO airstrikes in Libya The African Union 's special committee on Libya is represented by Mauritania , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Mali , Uganda as well as Zuma 's South Africa . 
As Gadhafi left one meeting at his compound in Tripoli , he made a rare public appearance for international media before riding off in a car as he waved to supporters near his tent . 
The leader then entered a second meeting with the delegation . 
Earlier Sunday , Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz told journalists that the meetings `` will discuss the ways to resolve the crisis in Libya , and our main goal is to stop the military operations and find adequate solutions for the problem between our Libyan brothers , '' according to a Mauritanian news agency . 
After a series of setbacks driven by the advances of pro-government forces , Libyan rebel fighters this weekend recaptured the besieged city of Ajdabiya after apparently holding off Gadhafi 's better-equipped forces . 
In a hospital , witnesses told CNN on Saturday that three of Gadhafi 's fighters who were killed were carrying identification cards from Syria , Algeria and Chad . 
Meanwhile , in Misrata , NATO airstrikes hit parts of the city overnight and Sunday , an eyewitness told CNN , who did not want to be named for security reasons . 
At least eight people were killed and 22 injured from Saturday 's fighting between the pro-Gadhafi forces and the rebels , according to medical sources in the city . 
On Sunday , two rebel fighters died as they attempted to hunt down pro-Gadhafi snipers near the city center , another eyewitness said . 
The rebels were able to recover the bodies of 15 such snipers shot earlier Sunday . 
The snipers took positions on top of residential and commercial buildings , the eyewitness said . 
NATO airstrikes on Sunday hit various positions in and around the city , destroying 14 tanks , the eyewitness said . 
Sporadic fighting continued Sunday , but had decreased from recent days as the airstrikes kept pro-Gadhafi forces busy . 
Some youths , captured in recent days by rebels , said they were teenagers and secondary-school students who had been forced to leave their homes in nearby towns and villages and undergo mandatory weeklong military training before fighting in Misrata , according to the second eyewitness . 
Pro-Gadhafi forces continued shelling parts of the city Sunday morning , the eyewitness said . 
A steel mill near the port was targeted but the port is now under rebel control , eyewitnesses said . 
However , the port still holds about 4,000 foreign workers who are trying to leave the city . 
Civilians living in the western sections of Misrata have been forced to leave their homes and have gathered in schools and friends ' and relatives ' homes near the city center , eyewitnesses said . 
In a statement Saturday , NATO said its aircraft destroyed pro-Gadhafi ammunition stockpiles east of Tripoli that were supplying troops shelling Misrata and other cities . 
The alliance also made attacks on armored vehicles near Misrata and Ajdabiya , NATO said . 
Opposition spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN that rebels flew two attack helicopters from Tobruk to join the fighting in Ajdabiya . 
`` There were some 50 regime pickup trucks with machine guns and rocket launchers that attempted to enter Ajdabiya , '' Abdulmolah said . 
`` The helicopters destroyed several of the trucks , and the rest took off . '' 
Abdulmolah did not know what kind of helicopters the rebel forces used in Saturday 's attack and could not confirm whether rebel forces coordinated the operation with NATO . 
NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from attack . 
The United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will travel to Cairo Thursday to head meetings on Libya at the Arab League headquarters . 
Among the participants will be Catherine Ashton , the representative for foreign affairs and security for the European Union . 
While Gadhafi has largely stayed out of the public eye in recent days , state TV aired images Saturday of the leader visiting what appeared to be a primary school in Tripoli . 
The anchor said the school was a target of international airstrikes and was going to be attacked . 
But NATO said in its statement that Gadhafi 's forces continue to use civilians as human shields . 
`` We have observed horrific examples of regime forces deliberately placing their weapons systems close to civilians , their homes and even their places of worship , '' said Lt. Gen. Charlie Bouchard , commander of NATO 's Operation Unified Protector . 
`` Troops have also been observed hiding behind women and children . 
This type of behavior violates the principles of international law and will not be tolerated . ''

2011-04-10,"TRIPOLI | Sun Apr 10 , 2011 7:33 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi has accepted a roadmap for ending the civil war in Libya , South African President Jacob Zuma said after leading a delegation of African leaders at talks in Tripoli . 
Zuma , who with four other African heads of state met Gaddafi for several hours at the Libyan leader 's Bab al-Aziziyah compound , also called on NATO to stop air strikes on Libyan government targets to `` give ceasefire a chance . '' 
No one at the talks gave details of the roadmap for peace in this oil-producing nation . 
Rebels have said they will accept nothing less than an end to Gaddafi 's four decades in power , but Libyan officials say he will not quit . 
`` The brother leader delegation has accepted the roadmap as presented by us . 
We have to give ceasefire a chance , '' Zuma said , adding that the African delegation would now travel to the eastern city of Benghazi for talks with anti-Gaddafi rebels . 
NATO stepped up attacks on Gaddafi 's armor on Sunday to weaken the bitter siege of Misrata in the west and disrupt a dangerous advance by Gaddafi 's troops in the east . 
The alliance said it destroyed 11 tanks on the outskirts of the eastern rebel town of Ajdabiyah , which looked in danger of being overrun on Sunday , and 14 near Misrata , a lone insurgent bastion in the west that has been under siege for six weeks . 
There was no sign of any let-up in the fighting and despite the African leaders ' peace roadmap hopes of a negotiated settlement looked slim . 
A rebel spokesman rejected a deal with Gaddafi to end the conflict , bloodiest in a series of pro-democracy revolts across the Arab world that have ousted the autocratic leaders of Tunisia and Egypt . 
`` There is no other solution than the military solution , because this dictator 's language is annihilation , and people who speak this language only understand this language , '' spokesman Ahmad Bani told al Jazeera television . 
NATO said it had increased the tempo of its air operations over the weekend , after rebels accused it of responding too slowly to government attacks . 
The insurgents hailed the more muscular approach . 
The NATO strikes outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break the biggest assault by Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern front for at least a week . 
The town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north up the Mediterranean coast . 
A Reuters reporter saw six burning hulks surrounded by 15 charred and dismembered bodies in two sites 300 metres -LRB- 1,000 feet -RRB- apart on Ajdabiyah 's western approaches which rebels said were hit by air strikes . 
`` NATO has to do this to help us every single day . 
That is the only way we are going to win this war , '' said 25-year-old rebel Tarek Obeidy , standing over the bodies . 
The government attack , which began on Saturday , included a fierce artillery and rocket bombardment , while some of Gaddafi 's forces , including snipers , penetrated Ajdabiyah . 
Rebels cowered in alleys for several hours under the bombardment . 
The corpses of four rebels were found dumped on a roadside . 
`` Their throats were slit . 
They were all shot a few times in the chest as well . 
I just could not stop crying when I saw them , '' said rebel Muhammad Saad . 
`` This is becoming tougher and tougher . '' 
But by afternoon rebels looked back in control of Ajdabiyah , commanding key intersections , and the artillery and small arms fire had died down . 
Ajdabiyah had been the launch point for insurgents during a week-long fight for the oil port of Brega 70 km -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- further west , and its fall would be a serious loss . 
Gaddafi , making his first appearance in front of the foreign media in weeks , joined the visiting African leaders at his Bab al-Aziziyah compound . 
He then climbed into a sports utility vehicle and was driven about 50 metres -LRB- yards -RRB- where he waved through the sunroof and made the `` V '' for victory sign to a crowd of cheering supporters . 
It was Gaddafi 's second appearance in two days after he received an ecstatic welcome at a Tripoli school on Saturday . 
The appearances , and Gaddafi 's upbeat demeanor , confirmed the impression among analysts that his circle has emerged from a period of paralysis and is hunkering down for a long campaign , another sign that mediation will be difficult . 
Analysts predict a drawn-out , low-level conflict possibly leading to partition between east and west in the sprawling North African Arab state , a major oil and natural gas producer . 
NATO 's commander of Libyan operations said the alliance , which took over air strikes against Gaddafi from three Western powers on March 31 , had destroyed `` a significant percentage '' of Gaddafi 's armor and ammunition stockpiles east of Tripoli . 
Canadian Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard said after Sunday 's air attacks : `` The situation in Ajdabiyah , and Misrata in particular , is desperate for those Libyans who are being brutally shelled by the -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- regime . '' . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Killing people , whoever they are and for whatever reason , is a crime . 
If a tank or armored vehicle on the road is presumed to be attacking Libyan civilians , it 's absurd the pro-regime ones have to be decimated and pro-rebellion ones stay , contrary to NATO 's pledge of neutrality stance . 
It seems the West is impatient with an impasse that lasts so long and eager to jump in to achieve a mission at the touch of a button , or there will no more cheap oil to finance the economic recovery around the globe . 
Why is the West so desperate for the resources of Libya ? 
Is our economic situation that dire ? 
And yet , our dear leader and the Dems still insist on spending on `` academic fluff '' as usual . 
We need real financial planning for the US and the media , lest they go down with the people , needs to investigate the real economic situation , not the situation provided by the WH and the Fed , who are shaking in their boots hoping for a miracle to change the situation . 
Hope and change ... .

2011-04-11,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libya opposition retakes eastern city NEW : At least 5 civilians killed and 20 people wounded in Misrata , witnesses say Opposition says it rejects any plan that does n't include Gadhafi 's removal UNICEF : 20 children have been killed by shrapnel or bullet wounds in Misrata Mediators : Gadhafi agrees to cease-fire , political transition and international peacekeepers Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Libyan opposition has rejected a `` road map '' proposal by the African Union to bring an end to fighting between them and the government of Moammar Gadhafi , opposition leaders said Monday . 
Rebel leaders Mustafa Abdul Jalil and Abdul Hafiz Ghoga said they would not agree to any plan that fails to include Gadhafi 's removal . 
The African Union plan , which Gadhafi agreed to in principle , does not provide any solution to the violence against the Libyan people , Ghoga said . 
Cheers erupted from supporters when the announcement was made . 
The leaders said the opposition remains open to any other proposals the African Union may make . 
Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop all hostilities in his North African nation and allow outside forces to help keep the peace , his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement . 
Libya : Rebels hopeful with NATO 's help Wife of abducted Briton in Libya speaks Graffiti artist killed in Libya Gadhafi visits school in Tripoli The announcement came the same day UNICEF , the United Nations children 's agency , released a statement saying that at least 20 children -- some as young as 9 months old -- have been killed by shrapnel or bullet wounds in the city of Misrata . 
Ramtane Lamara , the African Union 's commissioner for peace and security , read the agreement with Gadhafi early Monday , flanked by Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim . 
-- An immediate end to all fighting . 
-- Libyan authorities ' cooperation `` to facilitate the diligent delivery of humanitarian assistance . '' 
-- The protection of foreign nationals in Libya . 
-- The start of talks involving various Libyan authorities , including opposition figures , with the aim of setting up `` an inclusive transition period '' to adopt and implement `` political reforms necessary for the elimination of the causes of the current crisis . '' 
The agreement , which the statement said Gadhafi had signed off on , states that the final resolution must consider `` the aspirations of the Libyan people for democracy , political reform , justice , peace and security , as well as social ... development . '' 
No timetable was spelled out as to when and if a cease-fire might take effect or the political transition might take place . 
In the agreement , Gadhafi does voice support for the `` deployment of an effective and credible monitoring mechanism . '' 
`` Leader Moammar Gadhafi expressed his full confidence in the African Union and its ability to successfully carry out the peace process in his country , '' the statement said . 
Gadhafi 's government has announced unilateral cease-fires before , only to continue to attack the opposition . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that Washington is still `` waiting to get a full readout '' from participants in the African Union 's peace mission in Libya . 
NATO : No apology for Libya deaths `` These terms are non-negotiable , '' Clinton said . 
She also reiterated the U.S. position that Gadhafi needs to step down from power . 
The African Union 's special committee on Libya has representatives from Mauritania , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Mali , Uganda and South Africa . 
Gadhafi has been a strong supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way . 
Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council , which Lamara heads . 
As such , opposition leaders had voiced doubt that any mediation involving that multinational group would end the conflict in a way that would satisfy their goals , which include Gadhafi 's ouster . 
The talks come as violence continues in the North African nation , where pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces have been engaged in bitter fighting since February . 
In Misrata on Monday , at least five civilians -- including two toddlers , a 75-year-old man and an Algerian worker -- were killed and more than 20 people injured in mortar attacks , two eyewitnesses said . 
Libyan state TV reported that `` colonial crusader enemies '' hit civilian and military positions in al-Jufra district in central Libya . 
After a series of setbacks driven by the advances of pro-government forces , Libyan rebel fighters recaptured the besieged city of Ajdabiya over the weekend after apparently holding off Gadhafi 's better-equipped forces . 
Amnesty International said Monday that it had fresh evidence of extrajudicial executions apparently committed by forces loyal to Gadhafi near Ajdabiya in recent days . 
Researchers of the rights groups reportedly saw the bodies of two opposition soldiers who had been shot in the back of the head after their hands had been tied behind their backs . 
In Misrata , NATO airstrikes hit parts of the city over the weekend , destroying 14 tanks , said a witness who did not want to be named for security reasons . 
NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from attack . 
On Sunday , two rebel fighters died as they attempted to hunt down pro-Gadhafi snipers near the city center , another witness said . 
The snipers took positions on top of residential and commercial buildings , the witness said . 
At least eight people were killed and 22 injured in fighting Saturday between the pro-Gadhafi forces and the rebels , according to medical sources in the city . 
Shahida Azfar , UNICEF 's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa , called for an immediate end to the siege of Misrata . 
`` Until the fighting stops , we face the intolerable inevitability of children continuing to die and suffer in this war zone , '' Azfar said in the statement Monday .

2011-04-11,"LONDON | Mon Apr 11 , 2011 8:14 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The most prominent Libyan defector said on Monday his country could become `` a new Somalia '' unless all sides involved in the conflict stopped it from descending into civil war . 
`` The unity of Libya is essential to any solution and settlement in Libya , '' former foreign minister Moussa Koussa Koussa said in a prepared statement to the BBC , which broadcast his comments with an English translation . 
`` I ask everybody , all the parties to work to avoid taking Libya into a civil war , '' Koussa said . 
`` This will lead to bloodshed and make Libya a new Somalia . '' 
Koussa , speaking publicly for the first time since defecting to Britain last month , said he was no longer in contact with the Libyan government of Muammar Gaddafi . 
Libyan Social Affairs Minister Ibrahim Zarouk al-Sharif told reporters in Tripoli he would not comment on the interview . 
`` I will not comment on anything he says while he is captured and -LRB- being held -RRB- hostage in a hostile country . '' 
`` How do you know he went there -LRB- to Britain -RRB- ? 
Maybe he was kidnapped . '' 
Scottish police interviewed Koussa last week over the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , hoping he would provide intelligence over the attack . 
A former spy chief , Koussa was a close adviser to Gaddafi since the 1970s and is believed to have played a key role in the release of the only person convicted for the bombing . 
He told the BBC he decided to resign `` when the Libyans started to lose security and stability . '' 
Koussa is the highest profile of a number of Libyan ministers and ambassadors who have resigned , some of them joining the opposition to Gaddafi . 
`` The solution in Libya will come from the Libyans themselves , through discussion and democratic dialogue , '' he said .

Full Article Libyan rebels reject African Union peace plan BENGHAZI , Libya | Mon Apr 11 , 2011 10:29 pm IST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels swiftly rejected an African Union peace initiative on Monday , saying there could be no deal to end a two-month-old civil war unless Muammar Gaddafi left power . 
The initiative collapsed hours after South African President Jacob Zuma , head of an African Union mission , said Gaddafi had accepted the plan , including a ceasefire proposal . 
As African presidents negotiated with the rebel leadership in their stronghold of Benghazi , residents said Gaddafi 's forces bombarded the besieged western city of Misrata where residents reported heavy fighting . 
Western leaders also rejected any deal that did not include Gaddafi 's removal and NATO refused to suspend its bombing of his forces unless there was a credible ceasefire . 
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told a Brussels news briefing that Gaddafi 's government had announced ceasefires in the past , but `` they did not keep their promises '' . 
Rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told a news conference after the talks in Benghazi : `` The African Union initiative does not include the departure of Gaddafi and his sons from the Libyan political scene , therefore it is outdated . '' 
NATO said its air strikes against government armor , which have recently increased , would continue as long as Gaddafi targeted civilians . 
A resident of the coastal city of Misrata , which has been under siege for six weeks , told Reuters heavy fighting was under way on the eastern approaches and in the center . 
Rebels told Reuters Gaddafi 's forces fired Russian-made Grad rockets into the city , where conditions for civilians are said to be desperate . 
Earlier Al Jazeera television quoted a rebel spokesman as saying five people died and 20 were wounded in Misrata , a lone rebel bastion in western Libya . 
Zuma did not travel from Tripoli to Benghazi with other AU delegates , to the rebels ' surprise , but issued a statement when he got home saying the mission was `` a huge success '' . 
Libyan officials have repeatedly said that Gaddafi , who holds no official state position , will not quit . 
The AU delegation was met in Benghazi by up to 3,000 demonstrators holding banners reading : `` African Union take Gaddafi with you '' and `` Gaddafi has committed genocide '' . 
They pushed up to the doors of the hotel where the talks were held , yelling `` the people want the downfall of the regime '' . 
Officials from NATO , which is bombing Libyan government armor under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , said they took note of the African Union plan but the alliance would continue operations while civilians were at risk . 
Human Rights Watch accused Gaddafi 's forces of indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Misrata which violated international law . 
It said about 250 people had died . 
The African Union does not have a good track record in brokering peace deals , having failed recently to end conflicts or disputes in Somalia , Madagascar and Ivory Coast . 
At the front outside the eastern rebel-held town of Ajdabiyah , rebels buried the charred bodies of Gaddafi troops killed in air strikes and said they were advancing westwards . 
But there were only light skirmishes on Monday on the contested road to the oil port of Brega , 70 kms -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- further west , in contrast to Sunday 's heavy fighting in Ajdabiyah when rebels repelled a government assault . 
NATO stepped up attacks on Gaddafi 's armor over the weekend , destroying 25 tanks around Misrata and Ajdabiyah after rebels accused them of acting too slowly . 
An AU statement after the Tripoli talks spoke of a transition but made no mention of Gaddafi 's future . 
Asked if the issue of him stepping aside was discussed , Ramtane Lamamra , AU Commissioner for Peace and Security , told reporters : `` There was some discussion . '' 
However he added : `` I can not report on confidential discussions because first of all I was not part of them . '' 
The AU proposal included an immediate cessation of hostilities , effective monitoring of the ceasefire , the delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of foreigners . 
In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States wanted to see `` the departure of Gaddafi from power and from Libya '' , but avoided comment on the AU plan . 
The rebels had previously rejected a negotiated outcome to what has become the bloodiest in a series of pro-democracy revolts across the Arab world that have ousted the autocratic leaders of Tunisia and Egypt . 
The NATO attacks outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break the biggest assault by Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern front for at least a week . 
The town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north up the Mediterranean coast . 
On Monday upbeat rebels were putting burned and mangled bodies into blankets by blackened government vehicles outside Ajdabiyah and dragging them into the desert for burial . 
`` We have been able to advance because of the air strikes , '' said rebel Belgassim El-Awami . 
It was not clear how far west the rebels had moved along a front which has swung back and forth for more than a week in a fight for the oil port of Brega . 
Opposition fighters have been overwhelmed by Gaddafi 's firepower in western Libya , close to his base of Tripoli , but are increasingly using guerrilla tactics to weaken his hold . 
Tripoli residents said there had been several attacks on army checkpoints and a police station in the last week and gunfire can be heard at night .

2011-04-11,"WASHINGTON | Mon Apr 11 , 2011 2:10 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States reacted cautiously on Monday to a peace plan for Libya rejected by the rebels , saying it was waiting for details and shedding no light on whether the proposal required Muammar Gaddafi to step down . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeated the U.S. view that the Libyan leader , embroiled in a civil war against rebels seeking to overthrow him , must leave power and the country but she did not include this on a list of `` non-negotiable '' demands . 
While a State Department official said the omission was not intentional , it suggested Clinton might be trying to leave some negotiating room to keep alive the African Union peace plan despite its rejection by the Benghazi-based opposition . 
It is unclear how the conflict may end given the apparent stalemate between Gaddafi 's forces and the rebels , who are being assisted by NATO air power . 
President Barack Obama , seeking to extricate U.S. troops from long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , has ruled out sending U.S. ground forces to Libya , a North African oil exporter which the United States long accused of sponsoring terrorism . 
The rebels said there could be no deal to end the two-month-old civil war unless Gaddafi , who has ruled the country for more than four decades , left power . 
Earlier , South African President Jacob Zuma , head of an AU delegation , said Gaddafi had accepted the plan , including a ceasefire proposal . 
Clinton largely sidestepped a question at a news conference about the U.S. view of the peace plan , saying she had received accounts of the proposal and how it was received by both sides but said she was waiting to get `` a full readout . '' 
She did not directly address a query on whether the proposal required that Gaddafi step down . 
`` We have made it very clear that we want to see a ceasefire . 
We want to see the Libyan regime forces pull back from the areas that they have forcibly entered . 
We want to see a resumption of water , electricity and other services to cities that have been brutalized by the Gaddafi forces . 
We want to see humanitarian assistance reach the people of Libya . 
These terms are non-negotiable , '' Clinton told reporters . 
`` We believe , too , that there needs to be a transition that reflects the will of the Libyan people and the departure of Gaddafi from power and from Libya , '' she added during a news conference with Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb . 
A State Department official said her choice not to put Gaddafi 's departure among the non-negotiable terms was not deliberate . 
It `` was not intentional . 
Our position remains that Gaddafi has to go , '' said the official , who spoke on condition that he not be identified .

2011-04-12,"By the CNN Wire Staff Rebel fighters celebrate after firing powerful rockets toward Libyan Army positions near Ajdabiyah April 11 , 2011 . 
NEW : Leading rebel official calls on international community to help Libyan civilians At least 10 killed in Misrata shelling , doctor says France and Britain call for intensified NATO attacks Ex-Foreign Minister Koussa flies to Qatar ahead of an international meeting Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi 's military machine pounded the western city of Misrata again Tuesday as France and Britain called for beefed-up NATO airstrikes to stop such attacks on the Libyan people . 
Witnesses reported heavy shelling in central Misrata , besieged for weeks and the scene of some of the worst fighting in the Libyan conflict . 
At least 10 people were killed and 30 others wounded in the heavy shelling , a doctor operating in two central clinics told CNN . 
The doctor , identified only as Dr. Hakim for safety reasons , said medical teams are exhausted from treating the wounded . 
Rebel fighter Moaath al-Misrati told CNN the shelling came after rebels killed several of Gadhafi 's snipers . 
`` We are expecting a ground offensive by the Gadhafi forces any time now , '' he said . 
Opposition leaders : We want Gadhafi out Libya : Rebels hopeful with NATO 's help Al-Obeidy : ` Please do not forget me ' What drove Koussa to leave Libya The witnesses said all telephone communications , including mobile service , had been cut . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe both called Tuesday for NATO to get more aggressive in Libya , and a rebel leader issued a plea for the international community to carry out the U.N. Security Council resolution of March 17 , which calls for `` all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack '' in the North African country . 
Hague told reporters in Brussels , Belgium , that `` a huge amount has been achieved in Libya , but clearly there is more to be done . '' 
Juppe said NATO needs to fully embrace the role it accepted -- to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi 's forces . 
`` NATO wanted to take charge of the military operations , we accepted it , '' Juppe said on France Info radio . 
`` It has to carry out its role today , which means to prevent Gadhafi from using heavy weapons to bombard the population . '' 
Specifically , Juppe mentioned the attacks on Misrata , where on Monday at least five civilians -- including two toddlers , a 75-year-old man and an Algerian worker -- were killed and more than 20 people wounded in mortar attacks , according to witnesses . 
In Benghazi , Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , the deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council , issued an `` urgent statement '' calling on the international community `` to intervene and stop the massacres that Gadhafi promised in Misrata , and to implement the UN resolution in any possible means . '' 
Ghoga told CNN that the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France . 
He said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders and he did n't know exactly what was being requested . 
Last week , when asked by CNN 's Reza Sayah which countries were providing rebels with weapons and training , Ghoga said , `` We are in communication with our brothers in Qatar and also with our brothers in the Egyptian republic and with our friends in Italy and France . '' 
He indicated in the interview that the weapons were on their way to Libya . 
Meanwhile , Libya 's most high-profile defector flew from Britain to Qatar Tuesday for talks on how to break the deadly impasse in his nation . 
Former Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa flew to the Qatari capital , Doha , to meet with government officials and Libyan opposition leaders ahead of the first meeting Wednesday of the Libya Contact Group , formed in London last month and charged with implementing United Nations resolutions . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will also attend . 
In a news conference in Benghazi , Ghoga did not explicity reject the idea of opposition leaders ' meeting with Koussa in Doha , but said such a meeting was `` not on the agenda . '' 
In an earlier interview with the BBC , Koussa had expressed concern that the situation in Libya was spiraling downward into a grinding war , in the mold of the conflict in Somalia . 
Koussa , who fled Libya last month and sought safe haven in Britain after resigning his post in Gadhafi 's regime , urged all parties to avoid plunging Libya into a civil war . 
`` This will lead to -LRB- much bloodshed -RRB- , and Libya will be a new Somalia , '' Koussa told the BBC . 
Koussa , a longtime Gadhafi confidant and a former Libyan intelligence chief , also told BBC , `` The solution in Libya will come from the Libyans themselves through discussion and democratic dialogue . '' 
did not explicitly reject the idea of meeting with Libya 's held a press conference on Tuesday and when asked if the opposition would be open to a meeting with Moussa Koussa - Libya 's former Foreign Minister - in Doha , the Deputy Chairman of the Transitional National Council did not explicitly reject the idea . 
He told reporters a meeting with Moussa Koussa in Doha `` was not on the agenda . '' 
An African Union attempt at forging peace fell flat when Ghoga and fellow rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the Libyan people . 
Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop hostilities and allow outside forces to help keep the peace , his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement after a meeting in Tripoli . 
The African Union plan announced Monday did not address whether Gadhafi will step down , nor is it binding . 
According to the memorandum detailed by Ramtane Lamara , the African Union 's commissioner for peace and security , the plan had four elements : -- An immediate end to all fighting -- Libyan authorities ' cooperation `` to facilitate the diligent delivery of humanitarian assistance '' -- The protection of foreign nationals in Libya -- The start of talks involving various Libyan authorities , including opposition figures , with the aim of setting up `` an inclusive transition period '' to adopt and implement `` political reforms necessary for the elimination of the causes of the current crisis . '' 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that Washington is still `` waiting to get a full readout '' from participants in the African Union 's peace mission in Libya . 
`` We 've made it very clear that we want to see a cease-fire , '' Clinton said . 
But she said there also must be , among other things , a resumption of water , electricity and other services to Libyan cities that have been `` brutalized by Gadhafi 's forces . '' 
She also reiterated the U.S. position that Gadhafi needs to step down from power . 
Ghoga , the Transitional National Council 's deputy chairman , on Tuesday said rebel forces were `` fighting in the direction of Brega '' from the western gate of the `` completely liberated '' city of Ajdabiya . 
`` Gadhafi 's forces still have some elements in Brega , '' he told reporters . 
`` We added more security personnel to protect the oil fields in the city because the regime is trying to strand us economically . '' 
`` The situation in Tripoli is very dire , '' Ghoga continued . 
He said fuel and food there were depleted `` because all fuel is being for the Gadhafi forces ' need -LRB- s -RRB- . '' 
Ghoga also claimed that `` thousands of demonstrators '' opposing the regime were arrested in the capital and that `` a large number of them were executed in the Saladin military academy , '' but did n't provide further details . 
CNN could not independently confirm those claims . 
He added that on Monday , `` there was a massive demonstration in Fashloum in Tripoli , and the majority were hiding their faces , fearing arrest . ''

2011-04-12,"TRIPOLI | Tue Apr 12 , 2011 12:49 am BST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - An African Union plan to halt Libya 's civil war collapsed , and rebels said the increasingly bloody siege of the city of Misrata by Muammar Gaddafi 's troops made talk of a cease-fire meaningless . 
The Red Cross said it was opening a Tripoli office and would send a team to Misrata to help civilians trapped by fighting , but one of Gaddafi 's ministers warned any aid operation involving foreign troops would be seen as a declaration of war . 
Rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said after talks with the AU delegation in Benghazi in the rebel-held east on Monday : `` The African Union initiative does not include the departure of Gaddafi and his sons from the Libyan political scene , therefore it is outdated . '' 
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's son Saif quickly dismissed the idea of his father stepping down . 
`` We want new blood , that 's what we want for Libya 's future . 
But to talk of -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- leaving , that 's truly ridiculous , '' he told French news channel BFM TV . 
`` If the West wants democracy , a new constitution , elections , well , we agree . 
We agree on this point but the West must help us to provide a propitious climate . 
But all these bombings , this support given to rebel groups , all that is counter-productive . '' 
Libyan television said the `` colonial and crusader aggressors '' hit military and civilian sites in Al Jufrah district in central Libya on Monday . 
Rebels in the coastal city of Misrata , under siege for six weeks , scorned reports that Gaddafi had accepted a cease-fire , saying they were fighting house-to-house battles with his forces , who fired rockets into the city . 
Western leaders also rejected any deal that did not include Gaddafi 's removal , and NATO refused to suspend its bombing of his forces unless there was a credible cease-fire . 
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told a Brussels news briefing that Gaddafi 's government had announced ceasefires in the past , but `` they did not keep their promises . '' 
`` Any future proposal that does not include this , we can not accept , '' he said , accusing Gaddafi of bombing , shelling and shooting civilians . 
A resident of Misrata told Reuters there was heavy fighting on the eastern approaches and in the center . 
Rebels told Reuters that Gaddafi 's forces had intensified the assault , for the first time firing truck-mounted , Russian-made Grad rockets into the city , where conditions for civilians are said to be desperate . 
Human Rights Watch accused Gaddafi 's forces of indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Misrata which violated international law . 
It said about 250 people had died . 
At the front outside the eastern rebel-held town of Ajdabiyah , rebels buried the charred bodies of Gaddafi troops killed in air strikes and said they were advancing westwards . 
The International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- is already deployed in Libya 's rebel-held eastern territory , where it has supplied hospitals , distributed food and visited government soldiers captured during the conflict . 
Speaking in Tripoli alongside a government spokesman , its regional head Jean-Michel Monod said his team had been officially invited to the capital . 
`` Now we will officially be here open for business , '' he told reporters . 
`` Of course it was high time as a neutral , impartial and independent humanitarian organization that the ICRC would come here as well to conduct discussions with the authorities . '' 
Libyan Social Affairs Minister Ibrahim Zarouk al-Sharif said some aid operations had been used as a cover to supply rebels . 
`` If humanitarian aid is brought through humanitarian organizations who specialise in this kind of work then we would welcome it . 
But if it comes with a military face then we wo n't accept it , it 's basically a declaration of war and might lead to a much bigger conflict . '' 
At talks in Luxembourg , Italy quarrelled with other European Union governments on how to handle thousands of migrants fleeing the turmoil in Libya and elsewhere in north Africa , while the EU executive urged the bloc to do more for the refugees . 
NATO attacks outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break the biggest assault by Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern front for at least a week . 
The town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north up the Mediterranean coast .

`` More than that we refuse to divide Libya .

2011-04-13,"By the CNN Wire Staff Delegates from Arab and African nations , as well as NATO , met at a summit in Qatar on Wednesday . 
Delegates agree to set up a funding mechanism for the opposition The Doha meeting convenes as civilian casualties mount Ban Ki-moon : As many as 3.6 million people could need help in the Libya conflict The rebels have asked for arms Doha , Qatar -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Delegates representing Arab and African nations and NATO coalesced behind the Libyan rebels at a summit in Qatar on Wednesday , promising more humanitarian aid and money channeled through a temporary trust fund of sorts . 
Members of what is called the Libya Contact Group agreed that a temporary financial mechanism could provide a way to get money to the Libyan opposition . 
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said participants in the Qatari capital , Doha , were discussing the possibility of using frozen Libyan assets for the fund . 
`` I think this discussion about the trust fund is very interesting , '' he told reporters . 
`` And we will look into it because the frozen international money belongs , if it 's government money , to the people of Libya . '' 
Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of Libya 's National Transitional Council , the country 's opposition body , said Wednesday night that international delegates had agreed to make the funds available . 
Libyan rebels plea to NATO Al-Obeidy : ` Please do not forget me ' Ghoga said more than $ 100 billion in regime funds would be unfrozen and made available to the opposition , though he did not say which country or countries would release the funds , or when . 
He also said rebels requested that NATO intensify its airstrikes and protection of the civilian population . 
The funding decision came amid a grim assessment of the humanitarian fallout from the Libyan conflict and reports of mounting civilian casualties . 
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the delegates that in a worst-case scenario , as many as 3.6 million strife-affected people could eventually require help , and that the money to provide that help has been slow in coming . 
So far the United Nations has seen only 39 % of the $ 310 million it requested in emergency funding , `` clearly insufficient given the prospective need , '' Ban said . 
`` It is critical that the international community act in concert , that we speak with one voice , and that we continue to work in common cause on behalf of the Libyan people , '' he said . 
The international delegates were meeting with Libyan opposition leaders in an attempt to work out a peaceful end to the deadly impasse in the North African nation . 
Despite a NATO-led aerial campaign and rebels fighting on the ground , leader Moammar Gadhafi has shown no signs of acquiescing . 
Among the high-profile attendees in Doha is Gadhafi 's former intelligence chief and foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , who fled to Britain last month . 
Ghoga said Koussa was not invited to any of the meetings , however . 
`` Nobody from the National Transitional Council even considered meeting up with him , '' Ghoga said . 
`` It is our belief that Moussa Koussa was seeking to get residency in Doha , or future residency . '' 
Rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah had said the opposition was open to meeting with Koussa if he first made clear , in writing , what he has to offer . 
The Libyan Contact Group was formed after a London conference on Libya last month . 
The first meeting in Doha comes as civilian casualties continued to mount . 
The besieged western city of Misrata has been especially vulnerable . 
Gadhafi 's tanks have been pounding the city , where several more people were killed Wednesday , Abdulmolah said . 
Tuesday , a doctor told CNN , at least 10 people were killed and 30 were wounded . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that Gadhafi 's forces have reportedly destroyed crucial food supply warehouses in Misrata and cut off water and power to the city `` in an apparent attempt to starve -LRB- residents -RRB- into submission . '' 
Snipers have targeted Misrata residents seeking medical attention , she said . 
A military official said on state-run television that NATO `` airstrikes hit Misrata 's main road of Tripoli Street , resulting in civilian casualties . '' 
The official said the towns of al-Sbai ` ah , Aziziyah and Sirte were also hit by `` the colonial crusader enemy . '' 
U.S. fighter jets have continued to fly bombing missions in the NATO-led campaign , Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said Wednesday , although U.S. officials had previously indicated in public comments that the U.S. mission had become limited to providing support , including refueling and electronic jamming . 
Lapan said the U.S. aircraft assigned to NATO are ordered to defend the pilots who are enforcing the no-fly zone , and nothing more . 
NATO , he said , must still request U.S. strike aircraft should they want them for offensive operations . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe both called Tuesday for NATO to get more aggressive with the airstrikes in Libya , and opposition members urged the international community to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for `` all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack . '' 
Libyan National Transitional Council member Ali Issawi said the rebels should be supported with military supplies . 
He said the Libyan people ought to have the right to defend themselves . 
Ghoga said the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France . 
He said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders , but he did n't know exactly what was being requested . 
`` I do n't think there 's going to be a problem in getting military equipment in , '' Ghoga said . 
Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani , a co-chair of Wednesday 's meeting , said the opposition 's international allies will consider the needs . 
`` Of course we will look at it and make things available for the Libyan people to defend themselves , '' he said . 
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with Milan anti-tank warheads , but he did not say when . 
There was no immediate response from the Qatari government . 
A week ago , a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with Milan anti-tank missiles , which they did n't have before . 
Fighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in Benghazi but did n't know where they came from . 
MBDA , the multinational missile manufacturer that makes the Milan missile , says it is in service in 43 countries around the world . 
It does not list those countries , but the military analysis site GlobalSecurity.org says the Milan missiles are used by the Qatari armed forces . 
`` The message to Gadhafi is clear , '' the Qatari prime minister said . 
`` He should use his head and those who are around him should advise him that it is in the interest of Libya , and if he is interested in Libya , then he should relinquish power and leave the Libyan people to decide their own destiny . '' 
Hague said arming the rebels would not necessarily mean violating an arms embargo imposed on Libya . 
`` We understand the resolutions to mean the arms embargo applies to the whole of Libya , but that in certain circumstances it is possible , consistent with those resolutions , to provide people with the means to defend the civilian population , '' he said . 
The Doha meeting follows an effort earlier this week by the African Union to forge a peace plan that had been accepted in principle by Gadhafi . 
Ghoga and fellow rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the Libyan people . 
Meanwhile in Germany , the foreign ministry said it had summoned the Libyan ambassador to inform him of the expulsion of five Libyan diplomats . 
They will have to leave Germany within seven days because of accusations that they intimidated Libyan citizens in Germany .

2011-04-13,"Moammar Gadhafi , third from right , stands Monday with the African Union delegation trying to mediate the Libyan civil war . 
Hopes for a Libyan cease-fire were raised briefly this week when it was announced that longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi had agreed , in principle , to the African Union 's `` road map '' proposal for peace . 
Gadhafi 's opposition later rejected the proposal , but its leaders said they would be open to any other proposals the African Union might make . 
African Union delegates join an international conference on Libya 's future on Wednesday . 
Could the African Union be the key to peace in Libya ? 
What is the African Union , anyway ? 
Here 's what you need to know : 1 . 
The African Union is relatively new . 
The African Union was formed in 2002 , replacing the Organization for African Unity , which had been in place since 1963 . 
Its membership is composed of every African nation except Morocco , which withdrew from the OAU in 1984 because it took exception to the OAU 's inclusion of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic . 
`` The main overriding idea was to give more prominence to Africa , to make it an organization that had real teeth , that could push Africa on the international stage , that gave it a more unified voice to Africans , '' said Richard Downie , deputy director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . 
The diplomatic boost is just one of the reasons the African Union was created . 
Economic prosperity was another -- the African Union is working toward the formation of a central bank and its own currency similar to the euro -- and there was a desire for Africa to be able to respond to its own security crises with peacekeeping troops and humanitarian aid . 
`` The idea going forward is that the AU will take more of a lead in trying to come up with solutions to Africa 's security problems rather than relying on the international community or the United Nations , '' Downie said . 
The African Union has been more effective than its predecessor . 
The African Union seems to have taken a much more active role than the Organization for African Unity ever did , implementing policies to reduce poverty and corruption . 
And one of if its most visible actions in recent years has been sending peacekeeping troops to Somalia and Darfur . 
The OAU had been criticized for sitting idly while humanitarian crises developed in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo .

NEW YORK | Wed Apr 13 , 2011 3:46 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. crude oil prices rose on Wednesday , snapping two days of losses , getting a lift from data showing U.S. gasoline stockpiles plunged last week and from lingering worries about the Libyan conflict . 
U.S. crude for May delivery settled up 86 cents at $ 107.11 a barrel . 
In London , Brent May crude gained $ 1.96 to settle at $ 122.88 . 
U.S. gasoline inventories fell 7 million barrels last week , the biggest weekly drop since October 1998 , to 209.7 million barrels , their lowest level since October last year , data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed . 
`` The gasoline stocks data was really supportive today , '' said Andy Lebow , broker at MF Global in New York . 
The big drop in U.S. gasoline supplies came amid rising pump prices , with last week 's national average climbing to $ 3.79 a gallon after crude prices rallied to 2-1\/2 - year highs . 
Rising U.S. gasoline prices have damaged confidence in the country 's future and forced Americans to adjust spending habits and lifestyles , a Reuters\/Ipsos poll found . 
U.S. crude inventories rose 1.6 million barrels to 359.3 million barrels , their sixth straight week of gains , helping pull down crude futures briefly around midday . 
That dip came as the dollar strengthened ahead of a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama outlining his proposal to cut the ballooning U.S. budget deficit . 
`` The market seemed to take seriously this lurch toward fiscal austerity from Obama . 
The numbers on the initial release appeared compelling . 
Hence , dollar rallied a bit , pushing down energies and precious metals , '' said John Kilduff , partner at Again Capital LLC in New York . 
Oil prices rose early after a two-day sell-off that was driven by cautious comments from Goldman Sachs . 
The influential bank said a robust crude rally looked overdone . 
The International Energy Agency and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also raised a red flag on skyrocketing prices , saying they could hurt global demand . 
The civil war in OPEC member Libya has shut off most of its production , which was around 1.6 million bpd before unrest began . 
Rebel-controlled oil fields are pumping around 100,000 barrels per day , but only a `` minimal amount '' is being exported , a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday . 
He spoke in Qatar , where talks were ongoing on Libya 's future . 
International powers called for the first time for Muammar Gaddafi to step aside , but NATO members squabbled over launching more air strikes to help topple him . 
OPEC spare capacity should be enough to cope with such an outcome , provided the upheaval does not embroil other producer nations . 
Saudi Arabia alone has more than 3 million bpd to spare . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It is not running out . 
Check the old reservoirs and ask your self why are they refilling ? 
The world will never run out of oil . 
I do n't buy into the fossil fuel theory . 
Oil is associated with Methane and they have discovered methane lakes on Saturns moon Titan and there is no way I gonna believe Titan once had a large dinosaur population . 
Time to drill and ` drill baby drill ' . 
amos033 , you may want to go take a science class or two . 
Methane is not oil . 
Methane at the temperatures of the surface of Earth is a gas , yes it is a Hydrocarbon like Oil , but it is not oil . 
Methane is a liquid on Titan because it is VERY cold there , on the order of -200 to -300 F from memory . 
Methane is a simple molecule , CH4 , there is lots of it in various places in the Universe . 
Oil on the other hand is a mix of more complex hydrocarbons . 
Yes more Oil will be generated , but it is a 100 million year type of process . 
After a few more months of rising gasoline , Americans will welcome Chinese ev 's she same way they scarfed down the German Beetle and the Japanese Prius . 
The $ 40,000 Chevy Volt was obviously designed for export , as most Americans could n't afford to charge it after paying the retail price .

2011-04-13,"PARIS | Wed Apr 13 , 2011 10:37 pm BST PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - France does not plan to start arming rebels in Libya , although it does not oppose others doing so , a French presidential source said on Wednesday after Franco-British talks on the deadlock in Libya . 
The source , who was present at talks between President Nicolas Sarkozy , Prime Minister David Cameron and their defense ministers , said France did not see the rebel force as sorely needing more arms . 
`` It does n't seem necessary today because the national transition council is not having problems finding the weapons they need and friends to show them how to use them , '' he said . 
`` We are not doing it . 
And nor are the British as far as I know , '' he added . 
`` It 's a decision that 's been taken -LRB- not to arm the rebels -RRB- but that does not mean we oppose those that do . '' 
He said the U.N. Security Council resolution authorising force to protect Libyan civilians also permitted arming the rebels `` because the best way to protect the population is to allow the Libyans who want to protect them to do so . '' 
Britain said on Wednesday it would supply 1,000 sets of body armor from surplus British defense supplies to Libyan rebels , on top of 100 satellite phones already sent . 
Wednesday 's talks in Paris cemented the Franco-British position in favor of ramping up air strikes on Muammar Gaddafi 's military , amid signs of cracks in the wider coalition . 
Sarkozy and Cameron met for dinner the same day coalition foreign ministers met in Qatar to discuss the stalemate in Libya 's civil war , calling for Gaddafi to go . 
Western Europe 's top two military powers are delivering most of the air strikes on Gaddafi 's armor and are frustrated at the smaller role played by allies , including the United States . 
Three weeks of air strikes have neither tipped the balance of the war in favor of rebels trying to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule nor ended his shelling of the besieged city of Misrata . 
`` This is about summing up the situation and making sure France and Britain are on the same page , '' another French source said of the Paris meeting , which lasted a couple of hours . 
`` Given the various proposals for a resolution , the idea is also to get them behind a single one to avoid Gaddafi taking advantage of nuances between the different ideas . '' 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe this week criticised NATO for not doing enough to stop the bombing of Misrata and Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said he regretted the lack of military strikes by partners such as the United States . 
`` NATO is not able at this time to oblige partners to participate in this action . 
Like you , I deplore for example the fact that France and Britain are bearing the brunt of this effort , even if the United States is still providing essential aerial back-up , '' Longuet told parliament on Tuesday . 
"
2011-04-14,"By the CNN Wire Staff Delegates from Arab and African nations and NATO offered support to Libyan rebels at a summit in Qatar . 
Emir says `` it 's possible '' rebels have received Qatari weapons Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi 's forces Thursday pounded the strategic port of Misrata , his sole daughter defied the coalition and the three leaders of that alliance declared the Libyan leader `` must go and go for good . '' 
To the west , in Tripoli , antiaircraft fire followed several thunderous explosions , and Libyan state television reported civilian casualties from NATO airstrikes . 
The attacks came as the alliance chief asked for more precision fighter jets in order to avoid civilian deaths . 
At a NATO summit in Berlin , Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters that NATO has the necessary assets to continue aerial strikes , but the tactical nature of the fight has changed . 
`` Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas , where before many targets were easier to get to , '' Rasmussen said . 
`` To avoid civilian casualties , we need very sophisticated equipment . 
So , we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions . '' 
With the conflict at a deadly impasse , Britain and France have been pressuring NATO to step up airstrikes . 
In a joint op-ed that will appear Friday in three European newspapers , U.S. President Barack Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron wrote about their vision of Libya 's `` pathway to peace . '' 
Is NATO doing enough in Libya ? 
Libyan rebels plea to NATO `` We are convinced that better times lie ahead for the people of LIbya , '' they wrote . 
They likened the fighting in Misrata to a `` medieval siege . '' 
The White House released text of the opinion piece , which called on the Libyan troops to return to their barracks . 
`` Our duty and our mandate under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 is to protect civilians , and we are doing that . 
It is not to remove -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- by force . 
But it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- in power , '' the three wrote . 
`` The International Criminal Court is rightly investigating the crimes committed against civilians and the grievous violations of international law . 
It is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government . '' 
Gadhafi 's daughter , Ayesha , speaking to a cheering crowd in Tripoli , said the United States tried to kill her and other children in 1986 . 
`` In 1911 , Italy attacked my country and killed my -LRB- great - -RRB- grandfather , '' she said . 
`` Now in 2011 , they 're trying to kill my father . '' 
`` My father once said that ` if the Libyan nation does n't want me , then I do n't deserve to live , ' '' Ayesha Gadhafi said . 
`` The Libyans answered him in a united voice : ` Those who do n't want you do n't deserve to live ! ' '' 
Ayesha Gadhafi also said rebel forces were being wrongly portrayed . 
`` Who are those civilians that you 're trying to protect while killing us ? 
Are they those who hold RPGs and other weapons ? '' 
The emir of Qatar , meanwhile , told CNN `` it 's possible '' weapons provided by his state have reached Libyan rebels in the past two days . 
Hamad bin Khalifa told `` The Situation Room '' that the opposition first must be trained in use of the weapons . 
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with anti-tank warheads , but he did not say when . 
A week ago , a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with anti-tank missiles , which they did n't have before . 
Rebels near Ajdabiya were beginning to show signs of discipline and have received new equipment , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . 
Despite the enhanced organization , they were not ready to take the offensive . 
In Misrata , at least 23 people were killed and more than 100 were wounded in the dawn attack at the port and a nearby residential area , said the director of one of the four clinics open in the city . 
He said at least 700 people have died since the violence erupted in Misrata in February The attacks Thursday destroyed a cement factory and cargo containers at the Misrata port , where a medical aid ship was expected to dock , residents said . 
`` If people do not die here from shelling , they will die from starving since Gadhafi is preventing aid from arriving to the port , '' said Mohammed , a medical assistant . 
He said the shelled port had reopened and did not sustain major damage . 
Misrata residents interviewed by CNN did not want to be identified because of security reasons . 
CNN could not independently verify the reports but the International Organization for Migration said it chartered an 800-person-capacity boat to evacuate at least 6,000 stranded migrant workers in Misrata , many of whom have been living in warehouses with little food and a lot of fear . 
The organization said the boat was carrying hundreds of tons of medical aid to Misrata and was en route to the port . 
`` From reports on the ground , this rescue mission can not come soon enough , '' an IOM worker on the boat said in a news release . 
`` It is going to be heartbreaking not being able to take everyone out at once . '' 
Misrata has been under siege for weeks . 
Reports of civilian casualties streamed in Tuesday and Wednesday . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that in addition to Misrata , the situation also is particularly grave in the cities of Zintan and al-Brega because of critical food and water shortages . 
Rebels have pushed back the battle lines in the east from the war-weary city of Ajdabiya toward al-Brega . 
`` We are also deeply concerned with the fate of third-country nationals who are trapped in the areas of fighting , '' Ban said at an Arab League meeting on Libya in Cairo . 
`` As the fighting rages , the situation will only get worse and the more distant a political solution . '' 
International delegates attending a meeting on Libya Thursday in Qatar again urged Gadhafi to step down immediately . 
But the Libyan strongman has shown no signs of backing down . 
State-run television aired video Thursday of Gadhafi hanging out of the sunroof of a sport utility vehicle and waving to other cars and people on the streets .

2011-04-15,"By the CNN Wire Staff A remnant base section of a MAT-120 cluster munition recovered in Misrata was manufactured by Instalaza SA of Spain . 
NEW : Libyan government denies the charge Most nations have banned cluster munitions Opposition demonstrators in Benghazi say they may fail without more NATO support Rebels say they are advancing toward al-Brega Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have fired cluster munitions into residential areas in the besieged western city of Misrata , Human Rights Watch said Friday . 
A spokesman for the Libyan government denied the charge . 
The organization said in a statement that it had seen three cluster munitions explode over the el-Shawahda neighborhood of Misrata on Thursday night . 
Researchers inspected debris from a cluster submunition and interviewed witnesses to two other apparent cluster munitions strikes , the statement said . 
HRW inspected the submunition , which it said had been discovered by a New York Times reporter , and determined that it was a Spanish-produced MAT-120 120mm mortar projectile , which opens in the air and releases 21 submunitions across a wide area . 
The submunitions explode on contact , disintegrating into molten metal that can strike people and penetrate armored vehicles , it said . 
`` It 's appalling that Libya is using this weapon , especially in a residential area , '' said Steve Goose , arms division director at Human Rights Watch . 
`` They pose a huge risk to civilians , both during attacks because of their indiscriminate nature and afterward because of the still-dangerous unexploded duds scattered about . '' 
Most nations have banned their use through the Convention on Cluster Munitions , which became international law in August . 
NATO : Give Gadhafi 's assets to rebels `` Libya needs to halt the use of these weapons immediately , and take all steps to ensure that civilians are protected from the deadly remnants they have left behind , '' Goose said . 
Human Rights Watch said cluster munitions were used about a kilometer from the battle line between rebel and government forces and appear to have landed about 300 meters from Misrata Hospital . 
But the organization , citing security concerns , said it could not inspect the impact sites and had not determined whether any civilians were hurt . 
A spokesman for the Libyan government said the charge was not true . 
`` We would never use such weapons against Libyan people , '' Musa Ibrahim said . 
`` Also , the world is watching , so we just could not do it . '' 
The charge came as Western leaders described a `` medieval siege '' Friday on Misrata , which has been pounded for days by Gadhafi 's mortar and artillery rounds . 
Some 1,200 of the more than 8,000 migrants stranded in the besieged city were rescued Friday by the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- . 
The group chartered a boat to pluck them from the war-torn port city and deliver them to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi in the eastern part of the country . 
The aid group said the migrants were from various nations and included women and children . 
All were weak and dehydrated . 
Medical agencies set up a small hospital on deck . 
The IOM identified 8,300 migrants living in the open around the Misrata port without adequate food or medical care as the city came under regular fire . 
The group hopes to send back the chartered boat to evacuate a second round of people if it receives enough donations . 
`` This is a terrible situation , '' said Pasquale Lupoli , the group 's Middle East representative . 
`` They are the forgotten victims of the crisis and should n't be . '' 
In Benghazi , about 2,000 anti-Gadhafi demonstrators held up signs and shouted slogans that made it clear they are still fighting for Gadhafi 's removal . 
`` Gadhafi Go to Hell , '' read one . 
`` Thanks for USA and NATO and France and UK , '' read another . 
But several participants voiced concern that the NATO efforts were not enough , telling CNN that without more support , they may fail . 
`` They did n't do anything , the NATO , '' one man said . 
`` We want more support from the United States of America , more power , more support for our people , '' said another . 
The military deadlock in Libya between Gadhafi 's forces and rebels shows little sign of resolution . 
Western powers have said repeatedly that airstrikes were intended to fulfill a United Nations mandate to protect civilians . 
However , in a joint opinion piece that appeared Friday in three European newspapers , U.S. President Barack Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron wrote about better times once there is a regime change . 
`` Our duty and our mandate under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 is to protect civilians , and we are doing that , '' they wrote . 
`` It is not to remove -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- by force . 
But it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- in power . '' 
`` The International Criminal Court is rightly investigating the crimes committed against civilians and the grievous violations of international law , '' they wrote .

The leaders likened the fighting in Misrata to a medieval siege and called on Libyan troops to return to their barracks . 
`` We are convinced that better times lie ahead for the people of Libya , '' they wrote . 
Opposition forces kept up the fight Friday , saying they had pushed west from Ajdabiya to the town of al-Brega , which has changed hands several times and appears to remain under the control of Gadhafi loyalists . 
Warplanes were heard Friday over Ajdabiya , but CNN could not independently verify the rebel advance . 
The debate over NATO 's strategy in Libya buzzed at high-level meetings this week in Europe as well as in Qatar , host of the first gathering of the international Libya Contact Group , charged with mapping out peace for Libya . 
With the conflict at a deadly impasse , Britain and France have been pressuring NATO to step up airstrikes . 
At a NATO summit in Berlin on Thursday , Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters that NATO has the necessary assets to continue aerial strikes , but the tactical nature of the fight has changed .

2011-04-15,"TRIPOLI | Fri Apr 15 , 2011 7:32 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama acknowledged on Friday there was a `` stalemate '' on the ground in Libya , but said he still expected the three-week-old air campaign to succeed in ousting Muammar Gaddafi eventually . 
Obama and the leaders of France and Britain earlier on Friday published a joint newspaper article pledging to continue the military campaign until Gaddafi leaves power , effectively making regime change the officially-stated aim of their air war . 
More than a hundred government rockets crashed into Misrata on Friday , a second day of heavy bombardment of the city , the lone major bastion of the rebels in the western part of Libya . 
Rebels said government forces had reached the city 's center . 
`` I did n't expect that in three weeks , suddenly as a consequence of an air campaign , that Gaddafi would necessarily be gone , '' Obama said in an interview with the Associated Press . 
He said the mission had succeeded in stopping large-scale civilian casualties , especially in the rebel-held city of Benghazi , and would eventually succeed in ousting Gaddafi . 
`` You now have a stalemate on the ground militarily , but Gaddafi is still getting squeezed in all kinds of other ways . 
He is running out of money , he is running out of supplies . 
The noose is tightening and he is becoming more and more isolated . 
`` My expectation is that if we continue to apply that pressure and continue to protect civilians , which NATO is doing very capably , then I think over the long term Gaddafi will go and we will be successful . '' 
A rebel spokesman in Misrata said pro-Gaddafi forces had shelled both the center and the road leading to the port , a lifeline for trapped civilians and the main entry point for international aid agencies , killing eight people on Friday . 
`` Today was very tough ... Gaddafi 's forces entered Tripoli Street and Nakl al Theqeel road , '' he said by phone , referring to a main Misrata thoroughfare , scene of heavy clashes in recent weeks , and the road to the port . 
`` Witnesses said they saw pro-Gaddafi soldiers on foot in the city center today . 
Except for snipers , they usually stay in their tanks and armored vehicles , '' the spokesman added . 
A government reconnaissance helicopter had flown over the city , he said , despite a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N. Security Council and enforced by NATO warplanes . 
Hundreds are believed to have died in Misrata , under what Obama , British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy described in their article as a `` medieval siege as Gaddafi tries to strangle its population into submission . '' 
`` It is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government , '' they wrote in the article , published on both sides of the Atlantic . 
They acknowledged that their new goal of regime change went beyond the explicit terms of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force to protect civilians , but said Libyans would never be safe as long as Gaddafi remained in power . 
The United States led the bombing campaign in its first week , but has since then taken a back seat , putting NATO in command with the British and French responsible for most strikes on Gaddafi 's forces . 
Obama made clear Washington was not planning to resume to a more active military role . 
`` What we 're doing is still providing jamming capacity , intelligence , refueling , so we still have a lot of planes up there . 
We 're just not the ones who are providing strikes on the ground for the most part , '' he said . 
Britain and France have been trying to persuade other NATO allies to contribute more fire power . 
NATO ministers met for a second day on Friday in Berlin , where the divisions were clear . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen voiced optimism that allies would supply more combat planes , but Italy immediately ruled out ordering its aircraft to open fire . 
French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said London and Paris wanted to extend strikes to Gaddafi 's logistic installations to try to break a stalemate in the two-month civil war . 
Russia attended the NATO meeting and said the alliance was going beyond the terms of the U.N. Security Council resolution . 
Russia abstained but did not veto the resolution in March . 
On the fluid eastern Libyan front , rebels said Gaddafi forces advancing from the oil port of Brega had opened fire on the western outskirts of the insurgent-held town of Ajdabiyah on Friday , killing one of their fighters . 
In the capital Tripoli , Reuters reporters heard intermittent gunfire on Friday evening . 
There was no immediate explanation . 
Libyan state television said `` the bombardment of the crusader and colonial aggressors '' had struck the al-Assah area , about 170 km -LRB- 105 miles -RRB- west of the capital . 
The rebels have begged for more air strikes to avert what they say is a potential massacre in Misrata . 
A rescue ship carrying nearly 1,200 Asian and African migrants , many needing urgent medical attention after weeks with little food or water in Misrata , was expected in Benghazi . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO allies were searching for ways to provide funds to the rebels , including helping them to sell oil from areas they control . 
`` The opposition needs a lot of assistance , on the organizational side , on the humanitarian side , and on the military side , '' she said . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
There is always Turkey 's Ergenekon and Al Queda or even the Taliban that they can rehire to keep them gainfully employed . 
ghadaffi must go it is the only thing that will bring peace to Libya . 
Regime change is the main focus of the allied coalition and the rebels could n't care if their western allied coalition carpet bombed all of Libya to achieve their aims . 
2 things are now going to happen . 
1 -- The destruction of Libya . 
2 -- The killing of untold numbers of Libyan soldiers and civilians .

2011-04-16,"\* Rebels say engaged in fierce battle for oil port \* Hope for `` good news '' by morning CAIRO , April 15 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels are engaged in a fierce battle in Brega and are hopeful they will soon capture the oil port , their military leader told Al-Arabiya television in comments aired late on Friday . 
It was not possible to independently verify the claim about insurgent gains on the fluid eastern front of Libya 's civil war . 
`` Our situation is very good . 
Thank God , today we began advancing toward Brega and there is now a big and fierce battle in Brega and we have high hopes that Brega will be ours in the coming few hours , '' Abdel Fattah Younes told Al-Arabiya . 
`` We are in a not-too-bad state of preparedness and our army fighters , youths and rebels are now doing a good job and in the morning there will be good news , '' Younes , the head of rebel forces , added . 
Younes said rebels had secured what they wanted in terms of weapons supplies from friendly nations , Al-Arabiya reported . 
Earlier on Friday , rebels said government forces advancing from Brega had opened fire on the western outskirts of the insurgent-held town of Ajdabiyah further east , killing one of their fighters .

2011-04-17,"By the CNN Wire Staff Conflict continues in Misrata , Libya NEW : Hundreds in Tripoli rally for Gadhafi , some vowing to act as ` human shields ' Witness : Gadhafi 's forces are using explosives that can kill indiscriminately A hail of rockets attack Misrata again Saturday Transitional council leader says the rebels need weapons Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For all the talk in diplomatic circles this week of finding peace for Libya , one thing remained clear Saturday : The war is raging unabated in Misrata . 
In the city under siege from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces and mostly inaccessible for journalists , other than those on government-organized tours , residents reported disturbing new developments Saturday . 
An opposition council member told CNN that loyalists were using bombs that look like perfume bottles . 
Photographs suggested they were shells fired from a grenade launcher that either did not explode on impact or were deliberately masked and placed in populated areas . 
Either way , they were proving lethal . 
The council member said Saturday that people have had their limbs blown off and children have been killed . 
Gadhafi accused of using illegal weapons The report comes a day after Human Rights Watch reported its members saw three cluster bombs explode Thursday night over Misrata 's el-Shawahda neighborhood . 
Researchers with the activist group inspected debris and interviewed witnesses about two other apparent cluster bombings , the report said . 
`` We hear explosions that sound like one big explosion followed by many smaller ones . 
We were told this is a cluster bomb , '' said the council member . 
He , like many other Libyans , did not want to be identified for safety reasons . 
The Libyan government has denied the use of such bombs , which are banned internationally because of their indiscriminate nature and ability to harm civilians even after a conflict ends . 
Ahmed Hassan of the Misrata opposition council said at least five people were killed and 44 others were wounded Saturday , after one witness saw a hail of rockets fall on the central Libyan city . 
Gadhafi 's forces also bombed several food and dairy production factories , including ones that produce milk and oil , Hassan said . 
Terrified residents are going out in groups of 20 or 30 to fetch bread . 
They are too scared to venture out alone . 
`` No one and nowhere is safe in Misrata , '' Hassan said . 
Medecins Sans Frontieres said Saturday that it had evacuated nearly 100 people by boat from Misrata . 
Most were suffering war-related injuries . 
The boat arrived in Zarzis , Tunisia , on Saturday . 
The international medical humanitarian group -LRB- known as Doctors Without Borders in English -RRB- said ongoing fighting has cut off people from medical assistance and hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with casualties . 
`` For weeks now , health structures have been struggling to cope with the influx of patients , '' said Dr. Morten Rostrup , an MSF doctor who participated in the evacuation . 
`` With the latest heavy bombardments in Misrata , the situation is worsening as hospitals have to discharge patients before their treatment is completed in order to treat those wounded by fighting , '' Rostrup said in a statement . 
The International Organization for Migration said Saturday that a chartered boat filled with hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid was heading to Misrata . 
The group 's first boat rescued 1,200 migrant workers and their families who had been stranded around the city 's port , which has been bombarded daily by Gadhafi 's forces according to witnesses . 
Deeper inside the city , witnesses for weeks have reported dire conditions , including food shortages and the persistent fear of pro-Gadhafi snipers taking aim at anyone walking on the streets . 
A clinic director told CNN at least 700 people have died since the violence erupted in Misrata two months ago . 
Meanwhile , a Misrata opposition council member accused Gadhafi of using Libyan state television as an effective command-and-control center after NATO airstrikes damaged lines of communications and made troop control difficult . 
The council member said Gadhafi has been sending orders to his troops through coded messages aired on state television and the rebels have been trying to decode them in order to defend themselves . 
He gave these examples : -- An anchor claimed that a bird laid a green egg in an area of Benghazi . 
The anchor hailed this as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for Gadhafi 's forces . 
The next day that exact area was attacked by what the councilman described as sleeper cells in Benghazi . 
-- During the weather forecast , a map indicated a large storm over the port area of Misrata . 
No storm ever appeared , but the next day Gadhafi 's forces attacked Misrata by sea . 
-- An anchor claimed that a honey bee spelled out Moammar with honey in Darnah . 
Once again , it was hailed as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for Gadhafi 's forces . 
The next day , sleeper cells in Darnah launched an attack . 
Despite weeks of aerial bombardment by international fighter jets , Gadhafi has shown no signs of acquiescing . 
He remains as defiant as ever despite calls this week again from global leaders attending a Libya conference in Qatar and a sternly worded newspaper opinion piece by U.S. President Barack Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron . 
But how to protect civilians has become an increasingly complex question . 
At a news conference in Benghazi , the deputy chairman of Libya 's Transitional National Council appealed to the international community to help prevent further tragedy . 
He said 1.5 million Libyans were under attack every day . 
`` We already have warned before that the regime was threatening real massacres against innocent civilians , '' Abdul Hafiz Ghoga told reporters . 
`` The international community is now witnessing what this regime is capable of . 
The destruction in Misrata and other cities is unacceptable . '' 
In Tripoli , four thundering explosions were heard Saturday evening -- believed to have been caused by NATO airstrikes -- followed by about 30 minutes of sustained anti-aircraft fire . 
Later that night , hundreds gathered outside Gadhafi 's compound in the capital , with some saying they 'd be willing to act as `` human shields '' as long as NATO warplanes targeted the manpower and infrastructure being used in support of the Libyan leader . 
`` Everyone here will die for Moammar Gadhafi , '' one young man told CNN . 
On the eastern front lines of the battle , rebels were still fighting to regain control of the oil town of al-Brega , which has changed hands several times already . 
`` We need weapons to defend our people , '' Ghoga said . 
NATO has said it needs more precision fighter jets because loyalist maneuvers have made airstrikes much more difficult without harming civilians . 
`` Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas , where before many targets were easier to get to , '' said NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen earlier this week . 
`` To avoid civilian casualties , we need very sophisticated equipment . 
So we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions . '' 
A witness in Misrata said NATO planes were flying overhead Saturday , but he had not seen evidence of bombing .

2011-04-17,"AJDABIYAH , Libya | Sun Apr 17 , 2011 7:07 pm EDT AJDABIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels scrambled to defend their eastern frontline outpost of Ajdabiyah on Sunday after fighting on the coastal highway toward the oil port of Brega occupied by Muammar Gaddafi 's troops . 
One witness said he saw around a dozen rockets land near the western entrance to town , which rebels wanted to use as a staging post to retake the oil port of Brega . 
Many fled as loud explosions boomed across the town . 
`` There are still some guys out there at the western gate but the situation is n't very good , '' said Wassim el-Agouri , a 25-year-old rebel volunteer waiting at Ajdabiyah 's eastern gate . 
`` We want weapons , modern weapons , '' said rebel Ayman Aswey , 21 . 
`` If we had those , we could advance against them . '' 
Ajdabiyah 's streets were almost deserted by mid-afternoon and rebels barricaded the roads with concrete blocks , tree branches and anything they could find for fear of an attack . 
Rebel pick-ups patrolled the streets and men took up positions across the town with machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers . 
Others returned to positions at the western gate with their weapons pointed west and south into the desert . 
`` We are ready for a street war . 
We have got dynamite and we 've got grenades , '' said rebel fighter Emtar el-Farjany , who was holding a stick of dynamite . 
Some rebels on Saturday made it into the outskirts of Brega , 50 miles to the west , but many others retreated to Ajdabiyah after six were killed by rockets fired by Gaddafi loyalists on the exposed coastal road joining the two towns . 
By Sunday , scores of volunteer fighters and civilian cars carrying men , women and children streamed east from Ajdabiyah up the coast road toward Benghazi , where the popular revolt against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule began on February 17 . 
Sunday marks a month since the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorising force to protect civilians in Libya , leading to an international air campaign . 
But despite NATO air strikes against Gaddafi 's armor , rebels have been unable to hold gains in weeks of back-and-forth fighting over the coastal towns in eastern Libya . 
`` From a military point of view , one can currently see there is a stalemate , '' the head of Germany 's intelligence service Ernst Uhrlau told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper . 
`` One can not predict at the moment how much longer Gaddafi can hold onto power . 
The area around Tripoli is much stronger in terms of the population and the tribes than the east , '' he said . 
In western Libya , the rebel-held city of Misrata has been under government siege for seven weeks , leading to a growing humanitarian crisis . 
Hundreds of civilians are believed to have been killed in the fighting and shelling of the city . 
A rebel spokesman said Gaddafi 's forces bombarded Misrata again on Sunday , killing at least six people . 
Abdel Basset Mezerik said at least 47 people were also wounded . 
The United States , France and Britain said last week they would not stop bombing Gaddafi 's forces until he left power . 
With NATO troops bogged down in Afghanistan , Western countries have however ruled out sending ground troops , a position reinforced by the British prime minister on Sunday . 
`` What we 've said is there is no question of invasion or an occupation -- this is not about Britain putting boots on the ground , '' David Cameron told Sky News in an interview . 
But he said outside powers would help in every other way to stop Gaddafi `` unleashing this hell on people in Misrata '' and other towns up and down the Libyan coast , including providing `` non-lethal equipment '' to the rebels . 
European Council President Herman van Rompuy said he viewed the Libyan rebel council as `` a valuable discussion partner ... that embodies the Libyan people 's aspirations , '' a political vote of confidence for a force which has struggled militarily . 
Earlier on Sunday a sandstorm obscured the flat expanse of desert stretching west from Ajdabiyah to Brega . 
Rebel Ahmed al-Zuwaihi blamed the weather for a lack of NATO air strikes . 
`` The weather is no good today . 
NATO has n't hit anything , '' he said . 
`` It 's a big opportunity for Gaddafi and he 's taking advantage of it . 
He might enter Ajdabiyah today . 
Today the planes are not going to hit anything . '' 
NATO warplanes instead bombed the area of Al-Hira , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- southwest of the capital Tripoli on Sunday and also hit the city of Sirte , Libyan state television said . 
Bursts of anti-aircraft fire were also heard in Tripoli on Sunday evening . 
Days of sporadic clashes on the road west to Brega have failed to break a deadlock in the fighting . 
Rebel officials said on Saturday their most experienced soldiers were clashing with Gaddafi 's forces on the edge of Brega . 
But the front line is hard to locate due to the hit-and-run style of fighting , long-distance shelling and the growing tendency of Gaddafi 's followers to launch flanking maneuvers and ambush less experienced rebel fighters on the coastal road . 
The rebels pushed hundreds of kilometers toward the capital Tripoli in late March after foreign warplanes began bombing Gaddafi 's positions to protect civilians , but proved unable to hold territory and were pushed back as far as Ajdabiyah . 
In Misrata , rebels say they have faced daily bombardment from Gaddafi 's forces . 
The U.S.-based rights group Human Rights Watch has also accused Gaddafi 's forces of using cluster bombs -- which scatter bomblets over a wide area , increasing civilian casualties . 
The Libyan government has rejected the allegations . 
A rebel spokesman , called Abdelsalam , said there was fighting around Misrata 's main thoroughfare Tripoli Street . 
`` Snipers are firing in all directions , '' he said . 
`` For three days , it was very tough . 
Gaddafi troops were launching powerful attacks . 
They have been firing artillery , mortars . '' 
Food was running short and long queues formed outside bakeries . 
Some streets were fast becoming unrecognizable . 
Hundreds of Libyans fled attacks by government forces in the mountains southwest of Tripoli and crossed into neighboring Tunisia . 
The region is populated by Berbers , an ethnic group traditionally viewed with suspicion by Gaddafi 's government . 
`` I 'm part of a convoy which included about 500 people fleeing death , '' said Aissa , from the town of Nalut . 
The Libyan government blames militants allied to al Qaeda for the fighting . 
Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi held talks with U.N. envoy Abdelilah Al-Khatib in Tripoli and condemned `` the unjustified crusader colonial aggression on Libya . '' 
He said Libya was ready to comply with U.N. resolutions to implement a ceasefire and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid , according to the Jana state news agency . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
The Soviets equipped with modern tanks and apache choppers in 1988 were also not ambushed , defeated and driven out by Afghans holding small weapons . 
Tactics matters more than just hardware or sabotage . 
If the Western countries stop bombing Libya , the war will be over shortly ; on the other hand , if they continue to drop their bombs , this civil war will be prolonged and there will be a humanitarian catastrophe . 
There is no popular revolt against Khadafi , only a few thousand rebels armed and trained by the Western countries are fighting the Government forces . 
If Great Britain , France and US really love those Libyan civilian lives , they should send their carriers and all means of transportation to bring them to their country , away from the tyrant rule of Gaddafi .

2011-04-18,"By the CNN Wire Staff Medics overwhelmed by Misrata misery NEW : Death toll up to 24 Sunday and Monday , a witness says NEW : Misrata residents are `` let down by NATO , '' a witness says U.N. official : Gadhafi 's regime gave `` no guarantees at all that the violence would cease '' Britain to help 5,000 escape Misrata Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The nightmare in Libya 's war-torn city of Misrata intensified Monday amid more shelling on the city and desperate measures to get medical care , an opposition spokesman said . 
`` The aid coming from outside is not enough . 
There is no hospital , '' said the spokesman , who wanted to be identified only as `` Mohammed '' for safety reasons . 
He said 23 people were killed and 104 were injured in shelling Sunday in Misrata . 
Another person was killed and nine were injured Monday , Mohammed said . 
`` The shelling and destruction by Gadhafi 's forces has not stopped since yesterday , '' he said . 
`` They are shelling mortar shells , cluster bombs and splinter mortar shells . 
The splinter mortar shells explode and throw lethal shrapnel , which has caused most of the tragedies . '' 
Conflict continues in Misrata , Libya Gadhafi accused of using illegal weapons The shelling was happening around residential and industrial areas of Misrata , the witness said . 
Monday 's shelling also fell on the city 's critical port area , Misrata 's lifeline to humanitarian aid . 
With a city hospital taken over by pro-government forces , makeshift clinics have popped up to treat the wounded . 
And in a city where access to food , water and electricity has been scarce , Mohammed said , people have been using cell phones for light during surgery . '' 
-LRB- With -RRB- all of this happening , we have n't seen NATO , '' Mohammed said , referring to the alliance that has led airstrikes against Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi 's military resources . 
`` There have been no strike for four days in Misrata . '' 
Misrata residents are `` disappointed and let down '' by NATO , he said . 
`` They hear NATO flying above , but Gadhafi 's forces do not run from them anymore . 
Gadhafi 's forces are not threatened by NATO anymore . 
The NATO planes are circulating as the destruction continues . '' 
As the battle between pro-Gadhafi forces and rebels demanding an end to Gadhafi 's four-decade rule forges ahead , a United Nations official said Monday that her meeting with Gadhafi regime members did not end with a promise to stop attacks . 
Valerie Amos , U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , spoke to reporters Monday in the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
She said she visited Gadhafi regime officials in Tripoli on Sunday . 
`` Let me be absolutely clear . 
I got no guarantees with respect to my call for the overall cessation of hostilities to enable people to move , to enable us to deliver supplies , '' Amos said . 
`` I did get an assurance from the government to carry out a needs assessment in Misrata . '' 
She added , `` I have to say , in that instance , we got no guarantees at all that the violence would cease . '' 
Britain will help 5,000 people trapped in Misrata `` escape the besieged city and will provide vital medical assistance to those who remain in towns across western Libya , '' the UK Mission to the United Nations announced Monday . 
The evacuations `` will get foreign workers who have managed to reach Misrata 's port safely out of the town , '' the mission said in a statement . 
Meanwhile , a British official met with U.N. leaders Monday to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Libya . 
`` Agencies working inside -LRB- Misrata -RRB- report shortages of critical supplies and attacks targeted against civilians and medical facilities , '' according to a statement from the UK 's Department for International Development . 
The statement said International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell would travel to the United Nations for `` urgent talks '' Monday . 
Misrata is n't the only city deluged by violence . 
On Sunday , forces loyal to Gadhafi shelled the city of Ajdabiya from 40-50 kilometers -LRB- 25-31 miles -RRB- away , Libyan rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . 
The loyalists who were targeting the city `` have no problem with the weather conditions there , '' referring to unconfirmed reports that NATO airstrikes were halted in the area due to weather conditions . 
Gadhafi 's forces were using missiles and mortars , `` and sometimes we feel that NATO wants to use any excuse out there so they do n't carry out their duties , '' Abdulmolah said . 
`` We ca n't understand -LRB- NATO 's -RRB- excuses . 
We want to save our population from being murdered by -LRB- Gadhafi 's -RRB- merciless death squads , '' he added . 
NATO did not immediately respond to a CNN inquiry about its operations Sunday . 
Earlier , however , the NATO press office said that it does not discuss ongoing operations and would not confirm or deny any reports . 
An official report from NATO said the alliance conducted 142 sorties on Saturday , of which 42 were strike sorties . 
NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians . 
The alliance has said Gadhafi 's forces started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes much more difficult to carry out without harming civilians . 
Misrata remained in control of the rebels Sunday , Abdulmolah said , though they were fighting about 200 to 300 Gadhafi troops inside the city . 
Rebel fighters pushed Gadhafi 's squads back to a shoe factory , from where they were shelling residential areas in the city , he said . 
NATO refused to bomb the shoe factory because it is a civilian facility , he said . 
In the end , the rebels pushed the loyalists out of the shoe factory , which they burned . 
Despite the incessant struggle , Abdulmolah said he was optimistic the rebels could overcome Gadhafi 's forces . 
`` We are confident that we will be able to liberate the city completely and rescue our civilians who are being targeted by the madness of Gadhafi 's death squads , '' he said .

2011-04-18,"Visitors look at a French Rafale warplane during the Lavex 2009 Airshow at the Mitiga air base near Tripoli in this undated photograph . 
Almost every modern conflict from the Spanish Civil War to Kosovo has served as a test of air power . 
But the Libyan operation to enforce UN resolution 1973 coincides with a new arms race -- a surge of demand in the $ 60 billion a year global fighter market and the arrival of a new generation of equipment in the air and at sea . 
For the countries and companies behind those planes and weapons , there 's no better sales tool than real combat . 
For air forces facing cuts , it is a strike for the value of air power itself . 
PARIS | Mon Apr 18 , 2011 4:33 pm BST PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The photograph shows a French Rafale warplane at the Mitiga air base outside Tripoli . 
A small crowd of men , women and children mill around the fighter , its tail fin lit up by the North African sun . 
Taken at an air show in October 2009 , the picture is one of several grabbed by military aviation photographers from Dutch website scramble . 
nl that highlight one of the ironies in the West 's enforcement of a no-fly zone over Libya . 
To take out Muammar Gaddafi 's air defenses , western powers such as France and Italy are using the very aircraft and weapons that only months ago they were showing off to the Libyan leader . 
French Rafales like those on show in 2009 flew the western alliance 's very first missions over Libya just over two weeks ago . 
One of the Rafale 's theoretical targets : Libya 's French-built Mirage jets which Paris had recently agreed to repair . 
The Libyan operation also marks the combat debut for the Eurofighter Typhoon , a competitor to the Dassault Rafale built by Britain , Germany , Italy and Spain . 
An Italian Air Force version of that plane was snapped at the 2009 show hosted by Libyan generals . 
Two weeks ago , that base - to which arms firms including Dassault returned last November - was attacked by western bombs . 
Times change , allegiances shift , but weapons companies will always find takers for their goods . 
Libya wo n't be buying new kit any time soon . 
But the no-fly zone has become a prime showcase for other potential weapons customers , underlining the power of western combat jets and smart bombs , or reminding potential buyers of the defensive systems needed to repel them . 
`` This is turning into the best shop window for competing aircraft for years . 
More even than in Iraq in 2003 , '' says Francis Tusa , editor of UK-based Defense Analysis . 
`` You are seeing for the first time on an operation the Typhoon and the Rafale up against each other , and both countries want to place an emphasis on exports . 
France is particularly desperate to sell the Rafale . '' 
Almost every modern conflict from the Spanish Civil War to Kosovo has served as a test of air power . 
But the Libyan operation to enforce UN resolution 1973 coincides with a new arms race -- a surge of demand in the $ 60 billion a year global fighter market and the arrival of a new generation of equipment in the air and at sea . 
For the countries and companies behind those planes and weapons , there 's no better sales tool than real combat . 
For air forces facing cuts , it is a strike for the value of air power itself . 
`` As soon as an aircraft or weapon is used on operational deployment , that instantly becomes a major marketing ploy ; it becomes ` proven in combat ' , '' says a former defense export official with a NATO country , speaking on condition of anonymity about the sensitive subject . 
A spokesman for the Eurofighter consortium said it had `` never been involved in talks to sell the aircraft to Libya '' and its presence at the Lavex air show outside Tripoli in 2009 was part of an Italian delegation organised at government level . 
Defense sources tell Reuters that Britain and Germany had vetoed any sale of Italian Typhoons to Libya , but the amount of other Italian military hardware on display demonstrated warm relations at the time between Tripoli and the government of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . 
France has been less timid about announcing arms talks with Libya which briefly held an exclusive option for Rafale jets . 
A French source , who asked not to be named , declined to comment in detail on past negotiations but said arms sales were handled at a government-to-government level .

2011-04-19,"By the CNN Wire Staff Britain to send military into Libya The EU is prepared to send troops for humanitarian assistance Opposition spokesman : 24 were killed and 113 were injured in Misrata this week He says residents in Misrata are disappointed with NATO Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain said Tuesday it is expanding its presence in Libya with military advisers and the European Union said it is prepared to send troops for humanitarian assistance if requested by the United Nations . 
Plans for increased Western involvement surfaced as Moammar Gadhafi 's forces shelled Misrata again Tuesday . 
Residents and refugees rescued from the city described a terrifying situation in the ravaged western city that continues daily to pay a heavy price in the Libyan war . 
`` The situation is very dangerous , every day the shelling is increasing , '' said a resident who was not identified for safety reasons . 
`` They are using more types of weapons , and people are wondering why NATO is not doing anything . '' 
The number of casualties was unclear Tuesday but at least 24 people have already died in Misrata his week , an opposition spokesman told CNN Monday . 
He said another 113 were injured . 
Rebel-compiled figures estimate that more than 10,000 people have been killed so far in the Libyan conflict and more than 55,000 have been injured . 
Medics overwhelmed by Misrata misery With a humanitarian disaster looming , the EU said it is ready to respond , but not without the blessing of the United Nations . 
An EU official , who asked not to be identified , said it is unclear how many troops would be deployed , though he said the number would be `` definitely less than 1,000 . '' 
The Council of the European Union agreed to the operation -- called EUFOR Libya -- earlier this month . 
If requested , EUFOR Libya would `` contribute to the safe movement and evacuation of displaced persons '' and support humanitarian agencies in their activities , the council said in a written statement . 
And Britain said it is sending a contingent of experienced military officers to the rebel stronghold of Bengazhi in an advisory role . 
The team will work with Libya 's Transitional National Council on how the opposition can improve military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said . 
It will also assist in the delivery of critically needed aid . 
`` This deployment is fully within the terms of UNSCR 1973 both in respect of civilian protection and its provision expressly ruling out a foreign occupation force on Libyan soil , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Tuesday . 
`` Consistent with our obligations under that resolution , our officers will not be involved in training or arming the opposition 's fighting forces . 
Nor will they be involved in the planning or execution of the NTC 's military operations or in the provision of any other form of operational military advice . '' 
The moves raise questions of whether a greater international military involvement on the ground could emerge . 
The Center for Strategic and International Studies ' Stephen Flanagan said the British stance is another step up the level of military engagement . 
He said he thinks that the British forces are trying to give `` more coherence '' and `` greater capacity '' to the efforts of the rebels to provide their own defense and that the alliance is trying to find more ways to keep up the pressure . 
But he does n't think using ground troops to get in the middle of intense urban conflict and civil war is on the allies ' minds right now . 
Keeping the pressure on Gadhafi and letting his forces know that the coalition is well intact is the hope , even if the allies do n't want to fight house to house themselves , Flanagan said . 
At the same time , he said , `` it 's hard to speculate . 
If Misrata fell would there be a turn ? '' 
Another analyst , the Brookings Institution 's Michael E. O'Hanlon , questions the hesitance of `` casualty-averse '' Western democracies to provide aid such as military training . 
He thinks more aid might turn out to be bolder and more helpful than keeping the forces they are supporting with air power at arm 's length . 
He said the allies should n't content themselves with `` incrementalism . '' 
`` We may wind up providing some of the things we 're skittish about , '' he said . 
Meanwhile , Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said Tuesday that the international Libya Contact Group , charged with helping map out Libya 's future , will discuss ways Libyan rebels can facilitate the sale of oil from rebel-held areas to international outlets when the contact group meets in Rome next month . 
Transitional National Council President Mustafa Abdul Jalil , speaking with Frattini , reminded the world again of Gadhafi 's indiscriminate attacks in population centers . 
Aid groups have been attempting to pluck desperate people from Misrata , which is hemmed in by Gadhafi 's forces on three sides . 
The only escape route is by sea . 
The International Organization of Migration chartered boats to evacuate stranded migrant workers and Britain said it will help another 5,000 people get out . 
Mohammed , an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only by his first name for safety reasons , said Misrata residents are disappointed with NATO , empowered by the United Nations to use force to protect civilians . 
But Misrata had not seen NATO airstrikes in several days , Mohammed said . 
`` Gadhafi 's forces are not threatened by NATO anymore . 
The NATO planes are circulating as the destruction continues , '' he said . 
NATO , however , reported progress in its mission . 
As of Monday , it had flown 771 sorties and 1,110 strike sorties . 
The NATO operation destroyed seven ammunition bunkers in the Tripoli area and four air defense radars in the Misrata area this week , the alliance said , along with equipment in the areas of Zintan and Sirte , Gadhafi 's hometown . 
NATO has said Gadhafi 's forces have started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes more difficult to carry out without harming civilians . 
But Gadhafi 's regime has given no sign of standing down . 
Valerie Amos , U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , met with the Libyan regime over the weekend . 
`` Let me be absolutely clear . 
I got no guarantees with respect to my call for the overall cessation of hostilities to enable people to move , to enable us to deliver supplies , '' Amos said Monday . 
`` I did get an assurance from the government to carry out a needs assessment in Misrata . '' 
She added , `` I have to say , in that instance , we got no guarantees at all that the violence would cease . ''

2011-04-19,"LONDON | Tue Apr 19 , 2011 8:42 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain said on Tuesday it would send military officers to advise Libyan rebels , worrying critics who fear the country is being dragged into a civil war . 
London said it would send about a dozen officers to Libya to help insurgents improve their organization and communications , but would not arm the rebels or train them to fight . 
With the Libyan conflict risking getting bogged down in a long stalemate , Western powers are searching for ways to bolster the rebels , whose military campaigns have been disorganised . 
Foreign Secretary William Hague said the decision to send military advisers was in line with a United Nations ' resolution aimed at protecting civilians in Libya and denied Britain was putting military `` boots on the ground . '' 
`` There is going to be no ground invasion of Libya , '' Hague told the BBC . 
The U.N. resolution bars an occupation force in Libya . 
Britain 's move is likely to anger Russia , which has already said that Western attempts to topple Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi violate a U.N. resolution which only authorised the use of force to protect civilians . 
`` The U.N. Security Council never aimed to topple the Libyan regime , '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Belgrade on Tuesday . 
`` All those who are currently using the U.N. resolution for that aim are violating the U.N. mandate . '' 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters on Tuesday he also opposed sending troops into Libya . 
But a French diplomatic source told Reuters Paris might send military liaison officers to Libya in the days ahead . 
Britain 's move also caused some dissent among supporters of British Prime Minister David Cameron 's coalition government . 
Several lawmakers from Cameron 's Conservative Party called for the recall of parliament , now in recess , to debate the move , saying that the ground had shifted since parliament approved British participation in the Libya no-fly zone last month . 
Conservative member of parliament John Baron said there was clear evidence of `` mission creep . '' 
`` What the no-fly zone has effectively become is the air force of the rebels , '' he told Sky News . 
Peter Bone , another Conservative lawmaker , voiced concern that Britain seemed to be `` taking sides in a civil war . '' 
Britain 's recent experiences in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , where hundreds of British soldiers were killed , have led to caution about new foreign military ventures . 
The leaders of the United States , Britain and France pledged last week to continue the military campaign until Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi leaves power . 
Britain 's Foreign Office said the team would advise the rebel interim national council on how to improve its organization , communications and logistics , but would not help plan rebel military operations . 
Britain says it has supplied rebels with telecommunications equipment and body armor but not arms .

EU reveals it would launch military operation in Libya for humanitarian assistance Troops would `` contribute to the safe movement and evacuation of displaced persons '' City of Misrata under attack on three sides by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The deployment of foreign troops on the ground in Libya could boost the NATO-led mission to protect civilians , though opponents of such a scenario from within the coalition may be difficult to convince , leading analysts say . 
On Tuesday the European Union revealed that it would be prepared to launch a military operation for humanitarian assistance in the war-torn North African country if it is supported by the United Nations . 
The mission , featuring `` definitely less than 1,000 '' troops , would `` contribute to the safe movement and evacuation of displaced persons '' and support humanitarian agencies in their activities , The Council of the European Union said in a statement . 
Separately , Britain , France and Italy also confirmed they would be sending military officers to Libya to advise the rebels , though French Defense Minister Grard Longuet ruled out sending ground troops to fight alongside them . 
EU boots on Libyan ground ? 
Forces loyal to the embattled Libyan leader have been shelling the rebel-held city of Misrata with artillery , resulting in the deaths of at least 27 people , according to an opposition spokesman . 
The city is surrounded by Gadhafi 's forces on three sides , with the port area the only lifeline for humanitarian aid -- and escape . 
Hundreds of migrant workers have been evacuated from the stricken city on charter boats . 
According to Alexis Crow , of London-based think tank Chatham House , air power can only do so much to protect civilians on the ground in these situations . 
`` The examples of Mogadishu in Somalia , Rwanda , Bosnia and Kosovo will have played quite heavily in the minds of European policymakers , '' she told CNN . 
`` In trying to stop a humanitarian disaster one thing that has been learned from these experiences is that you have got to have a ` hammer and anvil strategy , ' which is airpower combined with a compliment of ground troops in order to stop things like ethnic cleansing happening . '' 
NATO has said Gadhafi 's forces have also started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes more difficult to carry out without harming civilians . 
`` Troops on the ground would be able to get a more accurate fix on targets and call in what is known as ` close air support . ' 
This would make the air strikes more effective , '' said Paul Smyth , an ex-RAF Tornado navigator and former analyst with the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- . 
While admitting his surprise that an organization he described as a little `` timid '' militarily had proposed the plan , he said the use of ground troops is bound to raise questions about the original UN mandate in Libya , in terms of what is or is not meant by occupying force . 
`` Some countries have been open in saying there should be no boots on the ground , though I think this EU force would be acceptable under the current mandate as it is not an incursion . 
`` But it would be interesting if they wanted to make this a permanent move in terms of creating a safe haven for carrying out humanitarian assistance . 
This is similar to what was created to protect the Kurds from Saddam Hussein 's forces in northern Iraq in the 1990s . 
`` It would then become a peace enforcement operation . 
To do that there might be a case for underlining it with an additional mandate from the UN . '' 
Resolution 1973 was approved by the UN Security Council in March and authorized member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . '' 
However the prospect of sustaining casualties on the ground from snipers or roadside bombs -- threats that can not always be neutralized from the air -- would make governments nervous about contributing to this force , said Smyth . 
`` So many nations appear to have gone public already , adamant that they are not putting any boots on the ground in Libya . '' 
He said it would also be politically difficult domestically for these governments to change their mind and perform a U-turn , even if their aim is a humanitarian mission . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron told Sky News over the weekend that the UN-backed mission was clear : to enforce a no-fly zone and destroy Moammar Gadhafi 's ability to threaten civilians . 
`` We are very clear we must stick to the terms of the UN Security Council resolution . 
We must keep the support of the Arab world and I think that is very important to make sure this is done the right way , '' he said . 
Crow said the EU plan was also constrained by two things : the burden of responsibility and time . 
`` It 's the age-old question of burden sharing , '' she said . 
`` Who supplies the troops ? 
And if you 're sending them using the term ` humanitarian assistance , ' how long do you give it ? 
`` There is no stomach for long-term campaigns among the voting public in coalition countries . 
It could easily turn into a conflict resolution or stabilization mission as the line between objectives becomes blurred . 
If this is the case , how long do you leave troops there ? 
This makes me nervous . ''

2011-04-20,"By the CNN Wire Staff Will there be military intervention in Libya on humanitarian grounds ? 
NEW : Photojournalists Chris Hondros and Tim Hetherington are killed in Misrata Secretary of State Clinton is recommending $ 25 million in non-lethal aid to rebels Announcements from Italy and France came as the rebel council president met in Europe Libya 's foreign minister calls Britain 's move a step toward confrontation Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- France and Italy announced Wednesday that they will send military officers to Libya to advise rebels fighting for the ouster of leader Moammar Gadhafi and his regime . 
Following a similar announcement by the British government Tuesday , French government spokesman Francois Baroin said a `` small number '' of French troops was being sent to advise the rebels ' Transitional National Council . 
French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet has ruled out sending ground troops to fight alongside the rebels . 
`` This is a real issue that deserves an international debate , '' he said , adding , `` We are working within the framework of the 1973 resolution , '' a reference to the U.N. resolution that authorized action in Libya . 
`` You can not please everyone all the time , '' he said . 
Italy will send military advisers to train the rebels in self-defense tactics , Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maurizio Massari announced . 
White House press secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama was pleased with the coalition decisions . 
`` The president , obviously , was aware of this decision and supports it , and hopes that -- believes it will help the opposition , '' said Carney . 
`` But it does not at all change the president 's policy on no boots on the ground for American troops . '' 
Britain said its contingent of military officers will be sent to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi to serve in an advisory role . 
The team will work with the Transitional National Council to help the opposition improve its military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said . 
It will also help deliver aid . 
`` This deployment is fully within the terms of UNSCR 1973 both in respect of civilian protection and its provision expressly ruling out a foreign occupation force on Libyan soil , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said . 
The United States is not moving toward sending military advisers , according to a U.S. military official with knowledge of ongoing discussions within the U.S. military . 
The White House remains adamant there will be no U.S. ground forces in Libya , though U.S. intelligence operatives remain there , the source said . 
The official pointed out that U.S. military advisers ' record in past conflicts is mixed . 
Perhaps the most obvious example , the official said , dates to the Vietnam conflict , when the U.S. military 's role grew from an advisory one in the first years into a full-fledged conflict . 
If the United States were to send advisory troops to Libya , it would then have to provide security , transportation , supplies and other gear , and would have to have units on standby for emergency extraction if the advisory troops ran into trouble , the source said . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she has recommended that President Barack Obama authorize the U.S. government to send up to $ 25 million in non-lethal commodities and services to support Libyan rebels , including the Transitional National Council . 
She defended the work of the opposition . 
`` It was not a group that had been planning to oppose the rule of Gadhafi for years ; it was a spontaneous response within the context of the broader Arab Spring , '' she said . 
`` These are mostly business people , students , lawyers , doctors , professors who have very bravely moved to defend their communities and to call to an end to the regime in Libya . '' 
In Libya , rebel spokesman Jalal al Gallal called Wednesday 's announcements by France and Italy `` positive . '' 
`` We are pleased with the results , and I think it 's a prelude to more cooperation , '' he said . 
`` The more advisers we have on the ground , the better coordination we 'll have on the battlefield . '' 
The announcements from the European nations came as Transitional National Council President Mustafa Abdul Jalil was in Europe for meetings with leaders . 
`` I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Arabic countries , in particular Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . 
Every Arab country has its own issues and maybe some were later than others in giving their support but we would like to thank the Arabic countries and the European countries , NATO , the U.S. , Australia and Canada and all those countries that are supporting this Libyan revolution . '' 
Qatar and the UAE are among the countries contributing to the international effort in Libya . 
Libyan Foreign Minister Abdul Ati al-Obeidi on Tuesday blasted Britain 's announcement that it was sending military advisers . 
In an interview with ITN , he called it a step toward `` confrontation . '' 
In the besieged city of Misrata , four people were killed Wednesday as Gadhafi 's forces indiscriminately shelled residential areas , according to an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only as `` Mohammed '' for safety reasons . 
At least 27 people have been killed and 142 have been injured this week , Mohammed said . 
Tim Hetherington , a photojournalist who was nominated for an Oscar for a gritty and harrowing documentary about the Afghan war , was killed in Misrata , the president of the agency that represented him said Wednesday . 
And Getty Images Staff Photographer Chris Hondros died Wednesday of wounds , a spokeswoman for the photo agency said . 
`` Chris never shied away from the front line having covered the world 's major conflicts throughout his distinguished career and his work in Libya was no exception , '' said Manager of Public Relations Jodi Einhorn . 
`` He will be sorely missed . '' 
Two other photographers , Guy Martin and Michael Christopher Brown , were wounded , according to the New York Times . 
Libyan Foreign Minister al-Obeidi said the government would consider a cease-fire in Misrata if it was on both sides . 
`` I think the only way is give peace a chance '' through a general cease-fire , he told ITN . 
But Abdul Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council , rejected the offer , which he said would have included an interim government , free elections in six months and reform that would include Gadhafi 's future role . 
`` Gadhafi 's forces are the one 's who 've been asked by UN Resolution 1973 to cease fire . 
When he asked for a cease fire , he asked for a cease fire from strikes that are destroying his military forces , and if he wishes to cease fire then we have no objections to a cease fire . 
And as far as a political solution with the Gadhafi family still in the political scene of Libya 's future , this is an impossibility . '' 
He added , `` They have already made a statement that Gadhafi is not willing to leave and that he will stay here and fight until the last drop of his blood , and if that is his choice and that is the case , then the Libyan people will hunt him down , find him and charge him with the criminal offenses he 's created against the Libyan people . '' 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Wednesday said some of the Libyan government 's attacks on Misrata could go beyond warfare . 
A statement from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , said she condemned `` the reported repeated use of cluster munitions and heavy weaponry by Libyan government forces in their attempt to regain control of the besieged city of Misrata , and said that such attacks on densely populated urban areas , resulting in substantial civilian casualties , could amount to international crimes . '' 
Libyan leaders have repeatedly denied targeting civilians and insisted that the rebels are criminals wreaking havoc on the country . 
UNICEF , the U.N. children 's agency , said Wednesday that 20 children have been killed and `` countless others injured '' in Misrata alone . 
Among rebels , calls for help have been increasing each day . 
Aid agencies are afraid to enter areas such as Misrata , which is being targeted by Gadhafi troops , opposition activist Mohamed Ibrahim said . 
`` Some of them , they come . 
But most of them , they come near ... they hear the shelling and everything and they go back , '' he said . 
Aid groups have been attempting to pluck desperate people from Misrata , which is hemmed in by Gadhafi 's forces on three sides . 
The only escape route is by the city 's port -- an area witnesses said has also been shelled by Gadhafi 's forces .

2011-04-20,"A newfound freedom of speech has been embraced by Libyan musicians and artists One Libyan rocker : `` It 's an amazing feeling I 've never had in my life '' The artists say the Libyan rebels have weapons , but they 're not terrorists Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hip-hop artists do n't often smile , so it was no surprise that Libyan rapper MC Swat scowled suspiciously when I first walked into his cramped , cigarette smoke-filled studio in a former government building in Benghazi . 
This is where MC Swat , 23 , has been writing scathing lyrics about the Gadhafi regime ever since Libya 's uprising began in February . 
Libyan musicians and artists probably have a right to be wary of strangers . 
For decades , they say , they feared agents and paid informants of Moammar Gadhafi 's repressive regime who reported to the government any work they deemed hostile to the state . 
When asked what would happen if he rapped his anti-regime lyrics prior to Libya 's uprising , MC Swat said , `` I would be shot to death like Tupac , '' referring to the American rapper killed in 1996 . 
But here in Benghazi , the opposition 's de facto capital , there 's no sign of Gadhafi 's loyalists anymore -- or the fear that kept artists like MC Swat quiet for so long . 
A newfound freedom of expression has sparked an explosion in revolutionary music and art . 
Much of it takes place in a five-story building -- a government building turned cultural center -- that is steps away from the Mediterranean Sea . 
The building 's hallways are covered with art and anti-regime cartoons , and the rooms are often buzzing through the wee hours of the morning with dozens of young revolutionary artists at work . 
`` Tomorrow we will take over our land , '' MC Swat raps in his second-floor studio , his DJ and machine gun-toting friend by his side . 
`` Moammar , we 're coming with a mass revolution . '' 
A few doors down , 26-year-old Saleh Dreisi sketches a giant caricature of Gadhafi . 
On the third floor , the rock band Guys Underground practices its latest song dedicated to the revolution . 
`` When you get in this building , you 're going to find yourself in another world , '' said Marrawan Gargoun , the lead singer for Guys Underground . 
`` It 's like being Alice in Wonderland . 
It 's an amazing feeling I 've never had in my life . '' 
`` It feels like we 're touching freedom , '' said MC Swat , who often sleeps overnight in his studio . 
The revolution 's young artists say they represent the real Libya , and they bristle at allegations that Libya 's rebels include elements of al Qaeda and Islamist extremists . 
`` You can find men with beards , but they 're respectful Muslims , '' MC Swat said . 
`` They 're not terrorists . 
You can see they have weapons , but they 're fighting for our freedom . 
They 're not al Qaeda . '' 
Gagoun said , `` We were buried for 42 years , but this is the true Libya . ''

2011-04-20,"GENEVA | Wed Apr 20 , 2011 10:33 am EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Libyan government 's reported use of cluster munitions and heavy weapons in Misrata has caused substantial civilian casualties and may amount to crimes under international law , the United Nations said on Wednesday . 
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called for a halt to the siege of Misrata and condemned the attacks , including a cluster bomb said to have exploded last week several hundred meters from the hospital in the west Libyan city . 
`` Under international law , the deliberate targeting of medical facilities is a war crime and the deliberate targeting or reckless endangerment of civilians may also amount to serious violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law , '' Pillay said in a statement . 
The rebels accuse forces supporting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi of using cluster bombs . 
The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said last week government forces had fired the weapons into residential areas of Misrata and it had found remnants . 
The Libyan government , which denies shelling civilians , has also denied this allegation . 
At least two medical clinics in Misrata are reported to have been hit by mortar rounds or sniper fire , according to Pillay . 
Libya 's third largest city and the insurgents ' last major stronghold in the west has been under siege for more than seven weeks . 
Rebels said they fought troops for control of a main thoroughfare there Wednesday and eight people had been killed the previous day , mostly civilians . 
Hundreds of people are believed to have been killed in Misrata where aid workers say the humanitarian situation is worsening due to a lack of food , water and medical supplies . 
`` Using imprecise weaponry such as cluster munitions , multiple rocket launchers and mortars , and other forms of heavy weaponry , in crowded urban areas will inevitably lead to civilian casualties , '' Pillay said , adding that women and children were among the dead . 
Pillay , a former U.N. war crimes judge , said pro-government forces besieging Misrata , including commanders , could be held criminally liable for their orders and acts . 
The International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- was already investigating possible crimes . 
ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo has said Libyan authorities decided they were ready to kill unarmed protesters opposed to Gaddafi 's 41-year rule even before unrest spread from Tunisia and Egypt . 
He has raised concern about abductions , torture and killings . 
Pillay voiced concern about mistreatment of journalists by the Libyan authorities and said at least two journalists had been killed and 16 were missing , including 10 foreigners . 
`` Dozens of others have been detained , assaulted , physically abused -- possibly to the point of torture -- or expelled . ''

2011-04-20,"PARIS\/MISRATA , Libya | Wed Apr 20 , 2011 6:42 pm EDT PARIS\/MISRATA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - France promised Libyan rebels on Wednesday it would intensify air strikes on Muammar Gaddafi 's forces and send military liaison officers to help them as fighting raged in Misrata , killing nine civilians . 
Rebels said they fought Gaddafi 's forces for control of a main road in the besieged port city of 300,000 , the insurgents ' last bastion in the west of the country where civil war erupted in February over demands for an end to Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . 
Seven Libyan civilians , a Ukrainian doctor and a British photojournalist were killed in the course of heavy fighting between pro-government troops and insurgents in Misrata on Wednesday , medical workers said . 
Around 120 people were wounded , including the wife of the Ukrainian doctor who lost both of her legs , according to Khalid Abufalgha , a doctor on the Misrata medical committee that deals with civilian casualties . 
Photojournalist Tim Hetherington , co-director of Oscar-nominated war documentary `` Restrepo , '' died when a group including several photographers was caught in mortar fire . 
Another photographer was hospitalized in critical condition , doctors said . 
`` NATO warplanes are flying over Misrata but I do not know if there are strikes , '' a rebel spokesman calling himself Abdelsalam said by telephone . 
`` NATO has been inefficient in Misrata . 
NATO has completely failed to change things on the ground . '' 
Libyan state television said later that four people were killed in a NATO air strike on `` civilian and military targets '' in the Bir al-Ghanam area southwest of the capital Tripoli . 
There were `` losses in property and farmland , '' it said . 
Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's Libya operations , advised Libyan civilians to keep away from Gaddafi 's forces to help NATO carry out effective air strikes . 
Hundreds of people are believed to have been killed in Misrata , where aid groups say the humanitarian situation is worsening due to a lack of food and medical supplies . 
Evidence surfaced on Wednesday that Gaddafi 's government is dodging U.N. sanctions to import gasoline to western Libya using intermediaries who transfer the fuel between ships in Tunisia , a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters . 
One intermediary company , Hong Kong-based Champlink , previously unknown to the oil trading community , has sought a transaction for fuel delivery into Libya , according to a fax obtained by Reuters , and European oil traders said they had been approached by other such firms . 
In Paris , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who has spearheaded U.N.-backed NATO intervention , pledged stronger military action at his first meeting with the leader of the opposition Libyan National Council , Mustafa Abdel Jalil . 
`` We are indeed going to intensify the attacks and respond to this request from the national transition council , '' an official in the president 's office said , quoting Sarkozy as telling Abdel Jalil : `` We will help you . '' 
He did not say how NATO-led forces planned to overcome the stalemate on the ground after the United States and several European allies declined last week to join ground strikes . 
A French military sources said Sarkozy had won approval from NATO to carry out more air strikes and France had moved six fighter jets from Corsica to the southern Greek island of Crete , closer to Libya , for that purpose . 
Italy , the former colonial power in Libya that has provided air bases for the NATO mission but says its own planes will not open fire , said it may send 10 military trainers as part of increased Western efforts to help the badly pressured rebels . 
President Barack Obama still opposes sending U.S. ground troops to Libya , the White House said on Wednesday , but he supports a French and British move to dispatch military advisors to help rebels fighting Gaddafi . 
Vice President Joe Biden insisted in an interview with the Financial Times that U.S. strike aircraft , requested by France , were not needed to achieve the alliance 's goal in Libya . 
`` If the Lord Almighty extricated the U.S. out of NATO and dropped it on the planet of Mars so we were no longer participating , it is bizarre to suggest that NATO and the rest of the world lacks the capacity to deal with Libya -- it does not , '' he was quoted as saying . 
`` Occasionally other countries lack the will , but this is not about capacity , '' Biden said . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has recommended $ 25 million in commodities and services for Libyan rebels that would not include weapons , the State Department said . 
Obama still must sign off on this provision of aid such as radios , body armor and halal ready-to-eat-meals , spokesman Mark Toner said . 
Western officials say NATO is attacking only military targets consistent with the alliance 's U.N. mandate to impose a no-fly zone and protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . 
Rebels want NATO to go much further and provide close air support so they can break a prolonged battlefield stalemate . 
Abdel Jalil told reporters he had invited Sarkozy to pay a visit to the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi to demonstrate France 's support for ending Gaddafi 's autocratic rule . 
`` I think that would be extremely important for the morale of the revolution , '' he said . 
French officials did not say if the president had accepted . 
Gaddafi 's son , Saif al-Islam , was quoted by Al Arabiya TV as saying the government would prevail over the rebels and a new constitution was ready for when the insurgency was vanquished . 
`` Libya will not go back to what it was , '' it quoted him as saying on Libyan state television . 
`` The era of the first Jamahiriya -LRB- people 's republic -RRB- is gone and a new draft constitution has been prepared . '' 
The rebels say forces loyal to Gaddafi have been bombarding Misrata heavily over the last week . 
In signs of hardship , there are long queues for petrol and electricity has been cut so residents depend on generators . 
Thousands of stranded foreign migrant workers are awaiting rescue in the port area . 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , said the Libyan government 's reported use of cluster munitions and heavy weapons in Misrata may amount to a war crime under international law . 
The government denies it is attacking civilians in Misrata . 
France 's decision to send up to 10 military advisers to work with the rebels came a day after Britain , the other main leader of the coalition , announced a similar move . 
Government spokesman Francois Baroin stressed France had no intention of sending troops into Libya , where Western powers are struggling to break a deadlock in a two-month-old conflict . 
The French officers are expected to advise rebel leaders on how to organize their ragtag forces , now struggling against Gaddafi 's better-armed and - trained army . 
They will also liaise with NATO on the location of rebels and Gaddafi 's troops . 
Asked whether the dispatch of liaison officers amounted to `` mission creep , '' military analyst Jean-Dominique Merchet said it was only a small team and they would not be training fighters but advising their senior officers . 
`` It 's about putting a bit of organization into the rebel forces . 
It 's the French and the British doing this , it 's clear that NATO is not very keen , nor the Americans , '' he said . 
Independent defense analyst Paul Beaver said the decision to send military advisers was stretching the U.N. resolution . 
`` But I think without it the rebels are going to be so disorganized that we will have a stalemate in what is almost a civil war now , '' Beaver said . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Put the statues back up . 
It is shameful that the world lets this continue . 
Leaflets , safe passage for the mercinaries and 800 troops with Blackhawks and the Seige would be over . 
A ragrag of rebels egged on by the CIA , and next thing our sons and daughters will be over there losing their lives for banks and corps profits . 
The rebels are breaking international law by being in a city and using civilians as human shields . 
Shrapnel wounds could be from either side . 
Its about time the rebels left the city and the world woke up to another money grab . 
I can still remember Thatchers son trying to take over an oil rich country with his paid mercanaries . 
Probably a similar case here . 
Enough propaganda ... stop showing only ragtags that scatter after one shot ... show the damage and scarred bodies left after the `` humanitarian '' nato bombings as well ... This discussion is now closed .

2011-04-21,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : `` To me , the most important thing is just figuring out the way to cover it '' Hondros always took steps to minimize risks , a friend says In a recent video clip in Libya , Hondros described young unarmed teens Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The ship carrying the bodies of a U.S. and a British journalist killed Wednesday in Misrata reached port Thursday night in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
Oscar nominee Tim Hetherington and acclaimed photojournalist Chris Hondros died Wednesday while chronicling the gritty violence in the war-torn city of Misrata in Libya , their agencies said . 
Two other photojournalists were hurt in the incident , according to news reports . 
The International Organization for Migration ship , called the Ionian Spirit , was greeted by a number of young Libyans and about 20 rebel fighters . 
At the port , people carried banners reading , `` US and UK with your loss , you shared with us the price of freedom '' and `` US and UK your blood was mixed with ours in Misrata . '' 
Friends of the journalists remembered them Thursday as brave men committed to finding and exposing the truth even in dangerous conditions . 
Hondros had written an e-mail Wednesday `` basically saying that everything was fine and stable and he was enjoying his assignment and getting some good photographs , '' his friend Greg Campbell , who recently traveled to Libya with Hondros , told CNN . 
Gallery : Chris Hondros ' final photos Photojournalist Hetherington killed in Libya Two photojournalists killed in Misrata `` Every time you 're in an environment like that , I think in the back of your mind you 've realized that you may not come out of there , '' Campbell said . 
He and Hondros covered conflicts in Sierra Leone , Kosovo , and Nigeria together , he said . 
Hondros `` was always very , very safe . 
He realized the risks and he tried to minimize them as much as possible . 
So when I was traveling with Chris , we would take as many precautions as we possibly could . '' 
`` There are times , unfortunately , when you just do n't know which decision is right or wrong . 
Unfortunately , that 's what Tim and Chris found themselves in . '' 
Hetherington received an Academy Award nomination this year for `` Restrepo , '' a documentary chronicling the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan 's Korengal Valley . 
It was co-directed by journalist Sebastian Junger . 
Employed by Panos Pictures , Hetherington also worked with CNN in Afghanistan two years ago . 
CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen described Hetherington as humble , modest and a gentleman skilled in the taking of gritty photos of combat . '' 
` Restrepo ' was a labor of love for Tim ; he had a great deal of empathy for the young soldiers he documented , '' Bergen wrote . 
`` The resulting film is not only the best documentary about war I have ever seen , it is simply one of the greatest of all war films , sharing the epic quality of movies like ` Apocalypse Now ' or ` Full Metal Jacket . ' 
It is also very beautifully shot , revealing Tim 's great sense of picture composition . '' 
Hetherington 's last Twitter entry appears to have been made Tuesday : `` In besieged Libyan city of Misrata . 
indiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces . 
No sign of NATO . '' 
The journalists were walking in the front-line area at the end of Tripoli Street on the western edge of Misrata when a rocket-propelled grenade exploded , according to a town resident who wanted to be identified only as `` Mohammed '' for safety reasons . 
The group was traveling with rebel fighters , he said . 
Vanity Fair magazine , where Hetherington , 40 , was a contributing photographer , described him as `` widely respected by his peers for his bravery and camaraderie . '' 
Its profile says he had dual U.S. and British citizenship . 
Vanity Fair released a statement from Hetherington 's family . 
`` Tim was in Libya to continue his ongoing multimedia project to highlight humanitarian issues during time of war and conflict , '' it said . 
`` He will be forever missed . '' 
Hondros , 41 , suffered a fatal brain injury , according to The New York Times , which had a reporter in the hospital who spoke to a colleague at a triage center . 
Getty Images , Hondros ' employer , said it was `` deeply saddened '' by his passing : `` Chris never shied away from the front line having covered the world 's major conflicts throughout his distinguished career and his work in Libya was no exception . 
We are working to support his family and his fiancee as they receive this difficult news , and are preparing to bring Chris back to his family and friends in the United States . 
He will be sorely missed . '' 
Hondros , born in New York City to immigrant parents , won the 2005 Robert Capa Gold Medal from the Overseas Press Club of America for coverage of Iraq . 
He was a 2004 Pulitzer Prize breaking news photography finalist for `` his powerful and courageous coverage of the bloody upheaval in Liberia . '' 
Hondros ' work is featured in a multimedia exhibit slated to open May 7 in Chicago that features war images and is called Conflict Zone . 
At a panel discussion on war reporting in 2006 put on by the International Reporting Project in Washington , Hondros -- who had been to Iraq nine times by then -- had little sympathy for journalists who complained about conditions on the ground . 
`` I can talk about how I wish it was , '' he said , `` but , to me , the most important thing is just figuring out the way to cover it , which is what war journalists do all over the world . '' 
2010 : Photographer goes inside war 2009 : Images of Liberia 's civil war He said he was disappointed to hear that news organizations were having a hard time finding volunteers to go to Baghdad . 
`` I understand it from a human level , but it 's kind of surprising to me from a personal , journalistic one , '' he said . 
Guy Martin , a British citizen working for Panos Pictures , a photo agency , suffered shrapnel wounds to the pelvis and underwent vascular surgery Wednesday night , according to The New York Times . 
Mohammed said Martin was in critical but stable condition . 
Photographer Michael Christopher Brown suffered non life-threatening shrapnel wounds to his left shoulder . 
James Hider , Middle East correspondent for the Times of London , told CNN the four journalists were documenting fighting on Tripoli Street in Misrata . 
Hider said he was at a hospital and saw Hetherington die in a triage tent . 
`` It was shocking . '' 
The journalists , including Hetherington , had traveled Saturday by boat from Benghazi to Misrata , enjoying jokes and making sandwiches for refugees , Hider said . 
Martin and Brown remained hospitalized in Misrata , Human Rights Watch said . 
The office of the White House press secretary expressed concern about the safety of journalists in the country . 
`` The Libyan government and all governments across the world must take steps to protect journalists doing this vital work , '' it said in a statement . 
The office said , `` Chris 's tragic death underscores the need to protect journalists as they cover conflicts across the globe . '' 
The Committee to Protect Journalists said four journalists have died in the Libyan conflict . 
`` Two other journalists have been killed this year in the Libyan conflict . 
An unknown gunman killed Mohammed al-Nabbous , founder of the online Libya Al-Hurra TV , as the journalist was streaming live audio from a battle in Benghazi on March 19 . 
Cameraman Ali Hassan al-Jaber was shot when his Al-Jazeera crew was ambushed near Benghazi on March 13 , '' the group said on its website . 
CPJ has documented more than 80 attacks on members of the news media since unrest erupted in Libya in February , including `` numerous injuries , 49 detentions , 11 assaults , two attacks on news facilities , the jamming of two international television transmissions , at least four instances of obstruction , the expulsion of two international journalists , and the interruption of Internet service . 
At least six local journalists are missing amid speculation they are in the custody of security forces . 
One international journalist and two media support workers are also unaccounted for . '' 
`` Our hearts go out to family , friends , and colleagues of Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros , whose work in some of the world 's most dangerous places has had a profound impact on how we understand and perceive war , '' said Joel Simon , CPJ executive director . 
`` Their deaths are another illustration of war 's cruelty and a reminder of how devastatingly difficult coverage of the Libyan conflict has become . '' 
After Hetherington 's death , Jalal al Gallal , a spokesman for the rebels , issued a statement saying , `` This is no longer the Gadhafi regime taking on Libya 's people . 
This is Gadhafi taking on the world . 
He has spared no one , not women , not children , not journalists . 
This is now everybody 's war . ''

2011-04-21,"By Robert Mahoney , Special to CNN Photojournalists Chris Hondros , left , and Tim Hetherington were killed in the Libya conflict . 
Chris Hondros and Tim Hetherington , two other journalists , killed in Libya Many others are missing or jailed by pro-Tripoli forces , Robert Mahoney says Mahoney : To show the truth of conflict , journalists must get up close , in highly risky situations He says Libya treacherous : irregulars , plainclothes soldiers , armed pro-Gadhafi forces Editor 's note : Robert Mahoney is deputy director of the Committee to Protect Journalists , an independent , nonprofit organization working to defend press freedom worldwide . 
Mahoney has worked as a reporter and bureau chief for Reuters , reporting on politics and economics . 
He has covered conflicts such as the civil war in Liberia , the Palestinian intifada , the Iraqi missile attacks on Israel and the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It is a bitter irony that Chris Hondros , the prize-winning photographer killed in Libya on Wednesday alongside Oscar-nominated photojournalist Tim Hetherington , was to due to speak in New York next week on the dangers of covering conflict . 
I felt honored to be invited to sit on the same panel as him at the International Center of Photography , with other veteran battlefield photographers and their editors . 
The question for the panelists was essentially , `` Covering conflict : Is it worth it ? '' 
Each generation of journalists finds its own answers to that deceptively simple question . 
Advances in picture and audio technology , coupled with warp-speed mobile communications , have transformed newsgathering . 
But the essentials of sketching out the first draft of history , whether in words or in images , are the same . 
The only way to capture the truth is to get close to it . 
Despite powerful telephoto lenses , conflict photographers still work much like Robert Capa , who used a simple Contax camera to capture the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s . 
Hetherington and Hondros , who won the Robert Capa Gold Medal for his work in Iraq , understood the catalyzing power of the still image . 
Their work freezes the flow of blood or tears on a human face , rendering the real cost of fighting in Afghanistan , the Middle East , Africa and the Balkans . 
They knew that a single image , like the napalmed Vietnamese girl running from her burning village , can crystallize a whole war . 
Their work freezes the flow of blood or tears on a human face , rendering the real cost of fighting . 
That is why they were in the thick of bullets and mortar bombs in Misrata . 
Now , unfortunately , they join a tragically high honor roll of journalists who have given their lives to bear witness . 
The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented the deaths of 861 journalists over the past two decades . 
In that period , 150 have been killed directly in combat . 
Of those , about half were photojournalists or camera operators . 
Last year , 40 % of journalists who died in the line of duty were killed in combat-related crossfire and in dangerous assignments such as street protests . 
And this year , because of the uprisings in the Middle East , 12 of the 16 journalists killed worldwide have died covering combat or on dangerous assignments . 
Libya , with four combat deaths and brutal detentions of journalists , is especially dangerous for the press . 
The fighting is chaotic , with fluid or nonexistent front lines . 
Irregulars , soldiers without uniforms , pro-Gadhafi forces moving among civilians and firing into populated urban areas , all make for a deadly maze through which unprotected journalists must thread a path . 
Unlike the U.S.-prosecuted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , journalists in Libya are not embedded with any military . 
Hetherington and Hondros had worked as both `` embeds '' and unilaterals , the military jargon for those journalists who go it alone . 
It was extremely difficult , if not impossible , to cover the fighting in both U.S. theaters without the army . 
Hetherington turned this to his advantage brilliantly by co-directing the 2010 Oscar-nominated '' Restrepo , '' a film about a year spent on a forward operating base in Afghanistan with U.S. troops . 
Libya , with four combat deaths and brutal detentions of journalists , is especially dangerous for the press . 
Hetherington and Hondros knew from training and experience how to handle themselves in combat . 
As a photojournalist , you learn where to stand to shoot , what to wear , how to approach combatants , how to hire a driver , a fixer , an interpreter , how to choose a hotel , and on and on . 
Any journalist may wear a bulletproof vest and a helmet . 
But in the end , reporters are exposed . 
Mortar rounds and rocket-propelled grenades like those whizzing through the streets of Misrata are no respecters of Kevlar chest plates . 
Hetherington and Hondros were not alone . 
Two other colleagues with them on the street were wounded in the same attack . 
To the east , still other photographers and reporters are missing or in detention , grabbed by pro-Tripoli forces . 
In the eight weeks since this civil war erupted , the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented more than 80 attacks on the press , including the killing of a cameraman for Al-Jazeera and reporter for Libya Al-Hurra TV . 
As of today , 17 journalists are missing or in detention , among them three photojournalists : Spaniard Manuel Varela , European Pressphoto Agency ; South African Anton Hammerl , Christian Science Monitor ; and American James Foley , Global Post . 
We never will get to hear Chris Hondros ' thoughts on covering war next week at the International Center of Photography . 
He already gave his answer by venturing onto Tripoli Street in Misrata with his camera .

2011-04-21,"Explain it to me : CNN 's Nic Robertson on Libya 's revolution There was an expectation the military campaign in Libya would be quick But weeks into airstrikes , Moammar Gadhafi is holding strong Some say the war could drag on for weeks , months , or maybe longer Military advisers were seen by many as a sign of mission creep -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A desperate call for more help sounds from Libya almost every day . 
Libyans are disappointed , feeling let down by NATO , said one resident of Misrata , the western city under a vicious siege from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces . 
As blood flows on the battlefields that are Libya 's towns and cities , the optimism that surfaced at the start of the conflict is but a memory . 
The military campaign in Libya was expected to be quick and precise , using sophisticated aerial military technology optimized to reduce casualties . 
But it became apparent that Gadhafi was not going to fall quickly in the footsteps of his neighbors Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia or Hosni Mubarak of Egypt . 
He was not going to be the third data point , as it were , in the trend line of the Arab Spring . 
Now it seems the war could drag on for weeks , months or , by some troubling estimates , perhaps even years as NATO squabbles over strategy and Gadhafi camouflages his forces within civilian populations and , according to reports , is using banned weapons such as cluster bombs . 
Will NATO jets sway fight for Misrata ? 
Zawiyah is a ghost town Veteran photojournalist killed in Libya Libya rebels react to Hetherington death It can be perceived as a snub of Western military might . 
And the question now is whether any sort of political victory can be weaned from a seemingly struggling military campaign . 
How long before calm comes to Libya ? 
And how will Western powers , facing potential military embarrassment , respond ? 
`` They are trying to avoid losing , '' said military strategy scholar Michael Keane , a fellow of National Security at the Pacific Council on International Policy . 
`` But we 're not trying to win because we 're not sure what that means . '' 
Not sure because from the very beginning , U.S. President Barack Obama and his European counterparts have made it expressly clear that the Libyan campaign is not about regime change . 
The airstrikes began in mid-March under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , and NATO has been cautious to operate under that threshold , even when three of its members -- Britain , France and Italy -- decided this week to send military advisers to Benghazi . 
The choice to act in Libya came when it appeared the opposition effort -- previously implausible in a nation that has known only the iron grip of Gadhafi for more than 40 long years -- faced a series of setbacks that made massacre seem imminent in Benghazi . 
Some now believe that had Western powers intervened earlier , when the rebels were high on momentum in their march westward , the situation might be different . 
`` Had they really kept the pressure on Gadhafi , I do n't think we would be having this debate , '' said analyst Jawad al-Anani , a former deputy prime minister of Jordan . 
`` Somehow there was a slack in the operation . '' 
A `` slack , '' perhaps due to Obama 's reluctance to get U.S. troops -- already deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq -- involved in a third war . 
Even this week , the White House remained adamant there will be no U.S. ground forces in Libya , not even any advisers . 
But al-Anani is sure no one in the Arab world believes that the West was not salivating at the idea of a Gadhafi-free Libya . 
`` It could have been done easily , '' he said . 
`` This should have been Grenada , not Vietnam . '' 
`` Vietnam '' was one of the words used this week as word of advisers came out . 
`` Quagmire '' and `` mission creep '' also surfaced in a flurry of opinion on Libya . 
` Slippery slope ' in Libya mission Paris promises made to aid Libya rebels The alliance 's secretary general has asked for more precision fighter jets so as to avoid civilian casualties as the bombardment continues . 
France and Britain last week aired a desire to get more aggressive . 
The allure of precision bombing from the air is that it can reduce troop losses . 
It is `` an unusually seductive form of military strength , in part because , like modern courtship , it appears to offer gratification without commitment , '' former State Department adviser Eliot Cohen famously wrote after directing a U.S. Air Force Persian Gulf War air power survey . 
Its limitations were learned in other conflicts . 
`` The examples of Mogadishu in Somalia , Rwanda , Bosnia and Kosovo will have played quite heavily in the minds of European policymakers , '' said Alexis Crow of the London-based think tank Chatham House . 
`` In trying to stop a humanitarian disaster , one thing that has been learned from these experiences is that you have got to have a ` hammer and anvil strategy , ' which is airpower combined with a complement of ground troops in order to stop things like ethnic cleansing happening , '' Crow said . 
If the goal , however , is to establish a Libya without Gadhafi , then it seems likely that a greater military effort will be required , said Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . 
`` But it 's hard to get international consensus that supports military force deposing a government , '' he said , citing the Iraq example . 
That was a $ 1 trillion effort that did not garner widespread international support , he said . 
The Europeans , Alterman said , have relied on U.S. leadership in the past . 
But with the White House playing a secondary role in this effort , they are struggling to mount a sustained campaign . 
It 's too early to speak in terms of Vietnam , Alterman said . 
But certainly , a key expectation is that the impasse will be broken soon ; that the rebels have to be a more effective fighting force . 
There are , of course , a host of different scenarios for Libya , which have been debated to no end by observers of this war . 
Gadhafi could fall soon , though it seems unlikely . 
He could hang on to power for weeks , months or maybe years , fueled by oil resources in southern Libya . 
Or the country could be split in two . 
`` Two weeks from now , Gadhafi will certainly be in power , '' said W. Andrew Terrill , a research professor at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College . 
`` I do n't think major cities will exchange hands . 
It 's not going to be any major offenses . 
Neither side has enough combat power . '' 
Terrill said the threshold to trigger an invasion with troops on the ground has to be high and has not yet been reached in Libya . 
Gadhafi is killing his people but it 's not a genocide when you consider the number of deaths , reported in the hundreds in Misrata , which has half a million people , he said . 
`` That 's a tragedy , but we 're still not talking genocide , '' Terrill said . 
Political scientist Ali Ahmida said this week what he has said all along as he watches his homeland mired in conflict : `` It is not going to be easy . '' 
As much as he would like to see Libya prosper under freedom , Ahmida , a professor at the University of New England , said he can not support a NATO invasion . 
`` I am against any military intervention in Libya , '' he said . 
`` The people are wary of that . 
They had a horrible colonial experience and the generation of independence made a big mistake by aligning so closely with the United Kingdom and the United States . '' 
But NATO has already upped the ante with military advisers on the ground , Keane said . 
And history has proven , he said , that once you engage militarily , events take on a life of their own . 
In Misrata , urban warfare rages on and the death toll mounts . 
Acclaimed photojournalist and documentarian Tim Hetherington was among those killed this week . 
Before he died , he sent a message on Twitter that echoed the pleas of desperate residents : `` In besieged Libyan city of Misrata . 
Indiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces . 
No sign of NATO . ''

2011-04-21,"By the CNN Wire Staff NATO airstrikes heard in Tripoli Sound of jets , explosions heard in Tripoli U.S. Predator drones take flight in Libya Thousands have fled fighting in western Libya through the border crossing in Wazen A third chartered ship arrived in Benghazi , carrying bodies of two photojournalists killed in Misrata Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Large explosions and the sound of jets over Tripoli Thursday night indicated NATO has likely increased the intensity of its air strikes on Moammar Gadhafi 's key command and control military sites . 
CNN 's Fred Pleitgen , reporting from Libya , heard at least three major explosions . 
The alliance has issued a new warning to Libyan civilians to stay away from military areas , foreshadowing plans for attacks on targets seen as strategically significant in stopping the government 's attacks against civilians , a NATO military official said Thursday . 
The next phase will largely involve increased air strikes on key Gadhafi command , control and communications sites in and around Tripoli , although targets in other areas could be hit as well , said the official , who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter . 
Libyan official sorry journalists killed ` Slippery slope ' in Libya mission Zawiyah is a ghost town Veteran photojournalist killed in Libya NATO now has the use of armed U.S. Predator drones at its disposal . 
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates disclosed that the drones saw their first use in Libya Thursday , but poor weather forced them to return . 
Unmanned aerial vehicles offer more precise targeting , because their low-flying capability allows for better visibility , `` particularly on targets now that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions , '' Gates said . 
The Predators bring `` capabilities to the NATO commander that they did n't have before , '' he said . 
President Barack Obama approved their use . 
Rebels , who have complained that NATO was not being aggressive enough to protect civilians , said Thursday they had gained control of a key border crossing into Tunisia . 
The crossing at Wazen , Libya , could prove key to access to the city of Nalut , under siege by Gadhafi 's forces for the past month . 
Thousands have fled the fighting through Wazen to the nearby Tunisian town of Dehiba , where temporary camps have been set up for the displaced . 
The Tunisian state-run news agency , TAP , also reported the rebel takeover of Wazen after early morning fighting . 
About 100 forces loyal to Gadhafi , including a high-ranking officer , fled across the border into Tunisia , said Mohammed Ali Abdallah , spokesman for National Front for the Salvation of Libya . 
He said the rebels detained 14 members of Gadhafi 's forces . 
TAP reported that 13 Libyan officers have been detained by Tunisian military authorities . 
Explain it to me : Libya 's revolution Paris promises made to aid Libya rebels Will NATO jets sway fight for Misrata ? 
Also Thursday , a third ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration made its way back from the besieged city of Misrata to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in the east . 
More than 1,000 rescued migrants were on board , as were the bodies of photojournalists Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros , killed in Misrata on Wednesday , the organization said . 
The ship also repatriated the body of an Ukrainian doctor . 
Several banners were displayed as the Ionian Spirit docked late Thursday in Benghazi . 
One read : `` We feel for the families of the deceased , your blood was mixed with us in Misrata and with your loss you shared with us the price for freedom . '' 
Another said , `` US and UK with your loss , you shared with us the price of freedom . '' 
Hondros was American and Hetherington had dual British and U.S. citizenship . 
Twenty rebel fighters stood in military formation as the vessel arrived . 
The reported rebel takeover Thursday of Wazen comes at a time when many are questioning whether a military victory over Gadhafi is possible . 
France and Italy announced Wednesday that they will send military officers to Libya to advise the rebels . 
After a similar announcement by the British government Tuesday , French government spokesman Francois Baroin said a `` small number '' of French troops was being sent to advise the rebels ' Transitional National Council . 
French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet has ruled out sending ground troops to fight alongside the rebels . 
`` This is a real issue that deserves an international debate , '' he said , adding , `` We are working within the framework of the 1973 resolution , '' a reference to the U.N. resolution that authorized action in Libya . 
`` You can not please everyone all the time , '' he said . 
Italy will send military advisers to train the rebels in self-defense tactics , Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maurizio Massari announced . 
Britain said its contingent of military officers will be sent to Benghazi to serve in an advisory role . 
The team will work with the Transitional National Council to help the opposition improve its military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said . 
It will also help deliver aid . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she has recommended that Obama authorize the U.S. government to send up to $ 25 million in non-lethal commodities and services to support Libyan rebels , including the Transitional National Council . 
On Thursday , Clinton urged more patience from critics of the anti-Gadhafi campaign , noting that `` it is always a temptation in any conflict to -LRB- want -RRB- a resolution quickly . '' 
`` The opposition that rose up spontaneously was not a trained militia , '' she noted . 
The `` vast majority '' of insurgents `` had never participated in -LRB- any form of military -RRB- activity before . '' 
Clinton said Washington has `` a lot of confidence in NATO '' and is pleased with the performance of America 's allies in the conflict . 
In Libya , rebel spokesman Jalal al Gallal called Wednesday 's announcements by France and Italy `` positive . '' 
`` We are pleased with the results , and I think it 's a prelude to more cooperation , '' he said . 
`` The more advisers we have on the ground , the better coordination we 'll have on the battlefield . '' 
At least 27 people have been killed and 142 have been injured in Libya this week , according to an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only as Mohammed for safety reasons . 
Among them were the two acclaimed photojournalists . 
Hondros and Hetherington , who was nominated for an Oscar for a gritty and harrowing documentary about the Afghan war , both died Wednesday in a rocket-propelled grenade attack in Misrata . 
Mohammed said rebels have `` annihilated '' Gadhafi forces and have defeated snipers in the city in the past few days . 
Three loyalist tanks remain on Tripoli Street , he said . 
CNN could not independently verify his claims . 
The city 's hospital has reported nine deaths and 68 injuries .

2011-04-22,"Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan opposition leaders received a major morale boost Friday as a top U.S. senator made a surprise visit to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and urged greater American involvement in the bloody campaign to oust longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi . 
The visit from Arizona Sen. John McCain came a day after the United States said it was deploying predator drones to Libya . 
When we decide to use military force , we should make it short and decisive . 
Dragging it out is when more innocent people get hurt and killed and it gets exponentially more expensive . 
That is exactly what is happening now in Libya . 
In the long run , when America shows that we do n't waver on military comittments like we have been , diplomacy will also begin working much more effectively . 
That 's the ultimate goal . 
April 22 , 2011 04:25 pm at 4:25 pm | Is this really a surprise . 
John McCain never met a war he did n't like ... as long as he does n't have to serve again . 
April 22 , 2011 04:35 pm at 4:35 pm | It 's a civil war and we should not be involved ; especially since the rebels have ties to AQIL . 
And now , BHO is helping to arm those that would kill us . 
The only reason that the Euros were front and center so quickly was to protect their petroleum interests and nothing more . 
The only reason that US force is being used is to protect the petroleum interests of the Europeans . 
The Europeans and the rest of NATO do not have the capabilities that the US has for enforcing a no-fly zone -- Navy Air , Surface and Subsurface Arms and , now , drones . 
Ya know they do n't do anything for humanitarian reasons . 
And , they got all that favorable legacy media support . 
Do ya think the US would get the same favorable coverage if they had done the same in Kuwait\/Saudi Arabia or Iraq ? 
Ya know they would n't and did n't . 
Remember all those placards of , `` No Blood For Oil !! '' And we still have n't been repaid by either country ; not just for the fiscal expenditures , but for the lost and disrupted lives . 
I was a regressive -LRB- aka liberal progressive -RRB- until I learned to read , got a job and was mugged by willful tax and spend regressives and acolytes ; i.e. , unions .

Dammed if you do dammed if you do n't . 
April 22 , 2011 04:44 pm at 4:44 pm | Conspiracy theories are always so interesting . 
So it 's all about oil , huh ? 
For a country that supplies 2 % of the world 's oil supply ? 
Maybe it really is about the massacre that Gadhafi was about to impart on dissenters of his own country . 
The timing of our intervention really seemed to indicate the latter . 
April 22 , 2011 05:04 pm at 5:04 pm | Ca n't we just send drones to hover around his compounds , wait for Gaddafi to show his face -LRB- hint : it 's the guy in the ridiculous daishiki and stunner shades -RRB- and shoot the drone 's missiles ? 
April 22 , 2011 05:09 pm at 5:09 pm | So now folks are concerned over all the `` fighting '' going on in Congress , and gas prices and all of a sudden they 're not feeling too good about the future and where our country s heading . 
We 've got a situation in Lybia involving a madman out to kill or suppres anyone against him . 
Oil prices are going to be impacted , go figure . 
We 've had a situation here at home where one team 's goal has been to do everything possible to keep the country in the toilet so that they could regain the White House . 
That 's going to cause some fighting , go figure . 
We 've got a national press that sees dollar signs for themselves for every negative story they can post or concoct out of misinformation or innuendo , regardless of its ' lack of journalistic integrity . 
That 's going to cause collateral damage perception wise , and in turn at the polls . 
We 've re-elected the same idiots to power that put us in the crapper ; and we did it because we believed their lies about geting us out of the crapper , and with jobs no less they said . 
Instead they are reneging , again , on their promises and sworn duty to us , go figure . 
April 22 , 2011 05:11 pm at 5:11 pm | Looks like McCain has jumped on board the bus President Bush was driving . 
God bless George for pointing the way with the war in Iraq to get this Democracy ball rolling . 
He knew that if we could get just some of those people to see what Freedom is all about , the rest would get jealous and want a taste of it as well and so , here we go . 
The Arab people are tired of dictators and religious zealots telling them what to do and finally they are going to have their own Crusade . 
Now the question is first the Democrats could n't justify killing Sadam , but are now targeting Kadafi , but not Assad in Syria . 
Pray tell , what is the difference with Assad killing hundreds of protestors almost daily . 
As a side bar , I notice the liberal media says little about the mass graves that keep turning up in Iraq . 
THe latest had over 800 bodies in it and were victiims of Sadam . 
So Bush went in because of WMD , but really did it for MIC or Murder of Innocent Civilians ... God Bless George . 
April 22 , 2011 05:17 pm at 5:17 pm | What a hypocrite John Mccain is , he was bad mouthing the President for aiding the rebels , and now he is there acting like their savior . 
Is there no low that the GOP wo n't stoop to . 
April 22 , 2011 05:20 pm at 5:20 pm | April 22 , 2011 05:21 pm at 5:21 pm | McCain please stop trying to ` bait and trip-up ' the President , you simpleton . 
If you want more $ $ $ upport for the rebels than sell off one of your many mansions and ship them the cash . 
You WISH for the President to fall for your okey-doke sucker punch and spend money to help the rebels , that way you 'll be one of the first to flip-flop and scream : `` We 're BROKE , how dare he ? '' . 
Go back to the nursing home , or better yet go fly one of those fighter jets you 're so good at maneuvering . 
April 22 , 2011 05:22 pm at 5:22 pm | As you can see , if McCain were elected president , we probably would have had thousands of troops in Libya by now and ended up in another quicksand mess . 
Obama was smart to limit our involvement and let NATO and the allies pick up some slack . 
Yes , we are still involved -LRB- this is aimed at poster BeanerECMO -RRB- but some -LRB- like this poster -RRB- seems to ignore the fact that a prominent Republican is calling for MORE US involvement ! 
April 22 , 2011 05:32 pm at 5:32 pm | Its Good Friday , so I will try to be nice , but this little escapade of John McCain 's is totally disgusting . 
First he wants America to do more . 
We are doing enough , thank you very much . 
Then he says they should set up a Government with mainly the Europeans help because they are closer . 
Bet the Europeans a happy to be told what to do by this loser . 
Then , `` if he demands formal recognition of the rebels '' -- who is he to demand anything .

So who are we `` formally recognizing '' ?

2011-04-22,"By the CNN Wire Staff McCain : Western powers must do more for Libya NEW : Airstrike hits parking lot outside Gadhafi 's compound in central Tripoli The situation in Misrata `` will be dealt with by the tribes around Misrata , '' official says `` This only confirms that he wants to save face , '' rebel spokesman says of Gadhafi The rebels claim victory in taking over a central Misrata building Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An airstrike Saturday hit a parking lot outside the compound in central Tripoli of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , killing three people , a government spokesman said . 
Musa Ibrahim said he had no information about the identities of the dead in the attack on the compound , called Bab el-Azizia . 
The attack , presumably from NATO forces , came shortly after Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Khaim announced that Libya 's army will withdraw from the besieged coastal city of Misrata and allow tribal leaders to attempt to deal with the rebels . 
`` The situation in Misrata will be eased and will be dealt with by the tribes surrounding Misrata , '' Khaim told reporters . 
`` You will see how they will be swift and quick and fast . '' 
He added that the residents of Libya 's third-largest city have been in the grip of the conflict . 
`` The tactic of the Libyan army is to have a surgical solution , but it does n't work , '' Khaim said . 
`` With the airstrikes , it does not work . 
We will leave it for the tribes and Misrata people to deal with the situation -- either to use force or negotiations . '' 
He added , `` The tribal leaders have issued an ultimatum to the military saying they will deal with the situation if the military can not do it . 
... They will speak with the rebels and , if there is no solution , they will fight the rebels . '' 
In the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , in the east , rebel spokesman Ahmed Bani reacted to Khaim 's comments with laughter and derision . 
`` This only confirms that he wants to save face , '' Bani said of Gadhafi . 
`` This confirms that our rebels in Misrata have liberated Misrata and that Libya is still in one piece , not two , the way Gadhafi hoped . 
In regards to the tribes fighting the rebels ; how would you believe that a person will fight his brother ? 
And who are the tribes that are supporting Gadhafi , anyway ? '' 
He predicted that if Gadhafi forces leave Misrata , `` it will mean that this game is over . '' 
But he added that he did not necessarily believe they will . 
Earlier Friday , Bani said that Libyan rebels had wrested control of a key building in Misrata and made other advances in the city . 
`` This victory is quite important for us , and it shows that we are advancing and we are heading in the right direction , '' Bani told CNN about the rebels ' control of the National Insurance Building , which is on the main thoroughfare , Tripoli Street . 
Its height provided snipers with a clear view of surrounding streets . 
Bani said some fighters loyal to Gadhafi were negotiating to surrender their weapons to the rebels in exchange for the rebels ' assurances that they would not be harmed . 
But the carnage of recent days was on display at the city 's hospitals , where doctors were working long hours and beds were full . 
Gadhafi 's forces retain control of roads that lead to the seacoast city . 
But access by sea remains open , and on Friday another aid ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration left Benghazi for Misrata carrying food , medicine and other supplies . 
The organization said it hopes to rescue more casualties and stranded migrants from the city . 
`` Given the increasing number of casualties in Misrata and the thousands of lives that are in danger , we felt a responsibility to act , '' said Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore of Ireland , which is helping fund the chartered vessels . 
`` Colonel Gadhafi 's forces have agreed to allow ships into the port to evacuate civilians and we have requested that the IOM undertake an emergency operation on our behalf , '' Gilmore said . 
At a news conference in Baghdad , America 's top military chief acknowledged a stalemate on Libya 's eastern front , around the oil towns of Ajdabiya and al-Brega , both of which have changed hands several times . 
`` The regime forces have changed their tactics , and changed it in a way where they essentially look like the opposition forces , so it 's become a much more difficult fight , '' U.S. Navy Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters . 
`` And as I 've observed in recent days , essentially it is very much stalemate-like in the vicinity of Ajdabiya and al-Brega , '' Mullen said . 
He said the outcome -- toppling Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of rule -- is certain . 
But the timing , he said , is `` difficult to predict . '' 
Also Friday , Sen. John McCain made an unannounced visit to Benghazi , the rebel stronghold , where residents welcomed him . 
Some waved American flags , some chanted , `` Thank you John McCain ! 
Gadhafi go away ! '' 
The senator from Arizona 's arrival came a day after the United States said it was deploying drones to Libya . 
McCain , a proponent of beefing up U.S. efforts to oust Gadhafi , said the drones will increase NATO 's capability but not enough to break a `` significant degree of stalemate . '' 
Though he opposes sending U.S. ground troops to Libya , he said the international community needs to `` facilitate '' weapons and training for the rebels . 
McCain , the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Libya since the conflict erupted in February , challenged critics of intervention to tour Benghazi , as he did Friday , to see a `` powerful and hopeful example of what a free Libya can be . '' 
The top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee stopped by a hospital and suggested that Western powers are not doing enough for the rebels . 
`` Let 's face it : This is not a fair fight , '' said McCain , a decorated Vietnam veteran with clout in defense circles . 
`` Maybe we should be doing everything we can to help these people and maybe we 're not , and they 're dying . '' 
U.S. Predator drones were deployed Thursday in the North African nation as part of the NATO-led military efforts there . 
But as of Friday night , the drones had made no strikes , said a Pentagon spokesman , Navy Capt. Darryn James . 
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier that bad weather forced the deployed drones to return . 
Libya 's deputy foreign minister told reporters that the decision reflects poorly on U.S. President Barack Obama . 
`` He is involving himself in a dirty game , '' Khaim said . 
`` This is will be another crime against humanity committed by the American administration and I feel very sad for President Obama to be involved in such a thing . ''

2011-04-22,"RABAT | Fri Apr 22 , 2011 2:51 pm EDT RABAT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Morocco is seeking a political solution to the Libyan crisis , an official source at the foreign ministry said on Friday after Moroccan officials met representatives of Muammar Gaddafi and rebels this week . 
The source gave no details of how close any such deal might be or what it might entail . 
`` Morocco 's efforts are limited to humanitarian aid and to working and contributing to reaching a political solution through dialogue , '' the source told Reuters . 
Such solution should `` respond to the aspirations of the Libyan people and ensure a return of stability which is extremely important for the Mediterranean and sub-Saharan Africa , '' the source added . 
Late on Wednesday , Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri met officials from the rebels ' National Transition Council . 
Two days earlier , he met an envoy of Gaddafi -- a rare diplomatic contact between Libya and one of the staunch allies of the Western coalition seeking to overthrow him . 
The source said Morocco favored a political agreement within the framework of the United Nations resolution which imposed a no-fly zone and called for a solution that would meet the demands of the Libyan people . 
`` Nobody has asked us to mediate , '' the source said . 
Morocco has been one of the small number of Arab countries and the only North African state openly involved in talks with Western powers over the Libyan crisis . 
Several Libyan tribes have their origins in Morocco so the historical link is strong . 
Less than two weeks ago , an African Union bid to halt Libya 's civil war collapsed , after Gaddafi 's forces shelled the besieged city of Misrata and rebels said there could be no deal unless he was toppled . 
Foreign ministers of Western powers and Arab states called at a meeting in Doha last week for Gaddafi to leave power . 
Britain , France and the United States say they will not end their air campaign in Libya until Gaddafi leaves power . 
The top U.S. military officer said air strikes had hobbled Libyan forces but the conflict was moving into `` stalemate '' as Gaddafi 's forces pressed their siege of Misrata .

2011-04-22,"Libyan ground forces degraded by up to 40 percent : U.S. BAGHDAD | Fri Apr 22 , 2011 5:09 am EDT BAGHDAD -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Coalition air strikes have degraded Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's main ground forces by 30 to 40 percent , but the battle appears to be heading to a stalemate , the top U.S. military officer said on Friday . 
`` It 's certainly moving toward a stalemate , '' said Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. military 's joint chiefs of staff , addressing U.S. troops during a visit to Baghdad . 
`` At the same time we 've attrited somewhere between 30 and 40 percent of his main ground forces , his ground force capabilities . 
Those will continue to go away over time . '' 
Mullen said there was no sign of al Qaeda representation in Libya 's opposition , playing down concerns about any militant groups edging their way into the Libyan conflict . 
`` We 're watchful of it , mindful of it and I just have n't seen much of it at all . 
In fact , I 've seen no al Qaeda representation there at all , '' he said . 
Mullen arrived in Baghdad on Thursday . 
The United States is planning to withdraw its remaining troops from Iraq by the end of December , more than eight years after the U.S.-led invasion .

2011-04-24,"The rebels were guarding the station in an opposition-held region near Egyptian border Only one guard of the nine survived the attack , a medical official says An opposition spokesman confirms the ambush by Gadhafi loyalists Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Loyalists to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi killed eight rebel fighters in a rare attack earlier this week in an opposition-held region near the Egyptian border , a medical official and an opposition spokesman told CNN Saturday . 
The regime loyalists , riding in a convoy of nine vehicles , attacked an oil pumping station in the Libyan desert on Thursday , about 300 kilometers -LRB- 186 miles -RRB- southwest of Tobruk , said Dr. Rida Benfayed , a physician who claimed he treated a rebel fighter injured in the attack . 
Tobruk is a rebel stronghold one hour west of the Egyptian border and is the site of a key oil exporting facility where the rebels shipped out their first consignment of oil earlier this month . 
Benfayed said the gunmen opened fire on a team of nine rebel military guards manning the pumping station . 
The regime loyalists set a tire on fire to burn the remains of a senior rebel guard , the doctor said . 
Explain it to me : Mideast\/African unrest Yemen 's president agrees to step down The only guard who survived was shot twice in the leg but managed to escape and drive himself to Tobruk where he 's in stable condition at a hospital . 
Opposition spokesman Ahmed Bani confirmed the attack , which showed the regime 's capability to strike deep into rebel territory with ambush-style attacks . 
`` He -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- does n't want us to sell the oil , '' Bani said . 
`` This is a lesson for us . 
We will take measures to increase security along the pipelines . '' 
Bani said the pumping station sustained damage in the attack , though the extent was n't immediately clear .

2011-04-24,"CNN Student News - 4\/25\/11 Download PDF maps related to today 's show : THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . 
BEN TINKER , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Hey there , everyone . 
Happy Monday , and thanks for tuning in to CNN Student News . 
I 'm Ben Tinker , filling in today for Carl Azuz , who 's got the day off . 
As we kick off the last week of April , we 're going to get things started today in the Middle East . 
TINKER : There 's a deal being discussed in the nation of Yemen that would remove that country 's president from power . 
That 's something protesters have been pushing for weeks . 
They 've been marching through the streets , demonstrating . 
And in several cases , those demonstrations have turned violent , with fighting between protesters and security forces . 
The protests are centered around this man : President Ali Abdullah Saleh , who 's been in power for more than 30 years . 
This deal , which was put together by a group of countries in that region , says that President Saleh has to step down within 30 days . 
It also gives him and anyone who served in his government complete immunity from prosecution . 
Thousands of Yemeni people are angry at the deal , especially because it offers immunity to Saleh . 
They also want him to step down immediately . 
But as of Sunday afternoon , President Saleh had not signed the deal , and government representatives insist he wo n't unless the opposition groups agree to it . 
TINKER : From Yemen , we move west to the North African country of Libya and the city of Misrata . 
The battle to control that city has gone on now for seven weeks . 
Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting between Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces and the rebels who want him out of power . 
Over the weekend , Libyan officials said they stopped their operations in Misrata , but a rebel spokesman calls that a flat-out lie . 
CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson , who 's been covering the conflict in Libya , explains how we got to this point and what some of the potential outcomes might be . 
NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , Libya 's had Moammar Gadhafi leading the country for almost 42 years , and there 's been a push to see democratic change there . 
Although Libya is on Tunisia 's borders , the revolution in Tunisia really came to its initial conclusion with the ouster of President Ben Ali , who took exile in Saudi Arabia . 
That really sparked the revolution that then took place in Egypt , on the other side of Libya . 
So really , it was these two events , on both sides of Libya , that then gave the confidence to the opposition . 
And people want the chance , now , to choose their own political leaders ; to have political parties ; in some cases , to have a voice in their own futures . 
It went from being a sort of an `` unarmed civilian against government '' situation that we saw in Tunisia and Egypt , into more of an armed rebel revolt against the government , which is where it is today . 
You have the rebels in Benghazi to the east . 
You have Gadhafi in his seat of power and with the support of a lot of the principle tribes of the country in Tripoli . 
And you have a siege around the town of Misrata , where rebels are surrounded by government forces and are being shelled . 
It 's reaching a stalemate of sorts , but behind the scenes , there are political back channel talks that are going on . 
The foreign minister has talked about the possibility of an interim solution , being an interim government that would last for six months before elections . 
But at the same time , Britain , France and Italy are talking about sending advisers for the rebels , which potentially will stiffen positions , stiffen the Libyan government 's position , and make it harder , potentially , to reach any kind of a deal . 
Two potential futures : one is that there is a cease-fire , troops on the ground to monitor a cease-fire , an interim government and , ultimately , elections . 
There 's been a lot of blood-letting so far ; it 's going to be hard to walk away from this situation right now without further bloodshed . 
The other scenario is that both sides dig in deeper , refuse to negotiate , and there becomes a much wider-spread civil war in the country . 
STAN CASE , CNN STUDENT NEWS : See if you can I.D. Me .

I 'm St. Louis , Missouri , and I was first established in 1764 . 
TINKER : A tornado ripped across parts of St. Louis Friday night , and this is what was left behind . 
The twister and fierce winds were estimated at anywhere between 110 to 200 miles per hour . 
This thing damaged 750 homes , left tens of thousands of people without power . 
But incredibly -- thankfully -- there were no reports of any deaths or serious injuries . 
A local minister said `` buildings can be replaced , but lives can not . '' 
The tornado also hit the airport in St. Louis . 
No planes were able to fly out on Saturday , but this plane you 're looking at was one of the first to take off on Sunday . 
Our Dan Simon gives us an inside look at the incredible impact this storm had on the airport . 
DAN SIMON , CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Airport security cameras show what it was like inside the moment the tornado struck . 
Right now , everything appears fine . 
Then the lights go out , debris starts swirling , TSA officers run for cover . 
Another angle in front of a food stand . 
Watch as this guy on a cell phone looks behind him and sees things are not normal . 
Seconds later , it appears this whole concourse is swept up by the powerful wind . 
SIMON : The aftermath : a scene of broken windows and an airport that has to be quickly shut down . 
One arriving passenger says he saw the wind actually force a plane to slide 20 feet from the gate . 
ROSS TAYLOR , PASSENGER : By the time we got to the terminal , lights were out , there was glass everywhere , it was just open . 
There was blood everywhere from where people had been cut . 
SIMON : The tornado ripped through nine separate communities , destroying dozens of homes . 
But amid all the devastation , mostly just minor injuries . 
Authorities credit that to people heeding the warnings . 
WES BROWN , NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE : And that was not only because we had a 34-minute lead time from the National Weather Service , but because our media partners carried that warning immediately to the public , and thirdly , that the public did what we have told them to do . 
SIMON : Still , with so many dislodged from their homes , the Red Cross opened several shelters . 
Back at the airport , crews began the tedious process of boarding up windows . 
Any glass that had a crack was taken down . 
Airport officials say most operations will resume when the power is restored . 
While the airline traffic may resume , the cosmetic damage you see here may take months to repair .

TINKER : In the Christian faith , those 40 days of Lent are a time for prayer and penance and a time to prepare for Easter . 
That holiday , of course , was yesterday , as many of the world 's two billion Christians celebrated the resurrection of Jesus Christ . 
Services and ceremonies took place around the world , including at the Vatican , led by Pope Benedict XVI . 
During his Easter blessing , the Pope urged an end to the violence in Libya and other Middle Eastern countries . 
And the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia held its annual Easter Sunrise Service ceremony yesterday . 
It began with a prelude from the U.S. Navy Band , and worshippers also heard from the U.S. Army chief of chaplains .

Although this version is a little more grounded in reality . 
And if that name does n't cause a little bit of a quizzical question for you , you must not be a fan of Harry Potter . 
The books and movies feature the sport , where contestants fly around on broomsticks . 
This college team just has to hold the broomsticks between their legs . 
Quidditch is quickly -- and not so quietly -- becoming popular on a lot of college campuses . 
TINKER : I guess you could say the high-flying sport is really taking off . 
And I 'd imagine that a win in that battle of the broomsticks would be a sweep victory , indeed . 
Time for us to fly .

2011-04-25,"By the CNN Wire Staff Reporter in Misrata : ` We 're under siege ' NEW : Offshore communications cable reportedly cut Ship takes nearly 1,000 migrants and 17 casualties from Misrata to Benghazi `` It 's just hell , '' says a reporter in Misrata NATO 's `` message '' was `` sent to the wrong address , '' a government spokesman says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan government forces directed their assault Monday on civilian areas of Misrata , resulting in a number of civilian casualties , witnesses said . 
`` It 's just hell , '' said Marie Colvin , a foreign affairs correspondent for the Sunday Times of London , who has been in the city for a week . 
`` Civilian neighborhoods are being decimated as we speak . '' 
She said that at least 10 people had been killed and at least 30 others wounded . 
But figures were difficult to confirm ; CNN was not in the city . 
A resident of Misrata who asked to be identified only as Mohammed said Monday that six people were killed in the morning . 
Building frequented by Gadhafi hit A doctor at a hospital in Misrata put the number of dead Sunday at 16 , with 71 wounded . 
The indiscriminate shelling began after rebel forces routed forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi from the city center early Sunday , Colvin said . 
The rout came after rebels moved from building to building along Tripoli Street , the main boulevard , ousting government forces , she said . 
Twenty-five rebels were killed in one day , and an undetermined number of Gadhafi soldiers were killed , she said . 
Asked about the rebel army , she laughed . 
`` We 're talking about an army of shopkeepers , engineers , car mechanics , '' she said . 
`` Very , very few trained military . '' 
At the fruit and vegetable market , government tanks that had been hidden under loading bays were set afire over the weekend . 
Their position there underscored the difficulty of NATO airstrikes in discriminating between government forces and civilians . 
Since then , stationed on the city 's edge , government forces have been firing shells randomly into residential neighborhoods of the city , she said . 
`` It 's a free-fire zone on civilians , '' she said from the hospital , where she said she had seen casualties that ranged `` from loss of limbs to an 8-year-old boy struck in the ankle by shrapnel . 
He 'll keep the foot , but he was in bad shape . '' 
Outside , a white tent served as a triage area ; a refrigerator truck was packed with bodies . 
When two people were killed in one house , the family got into a car , but it too was hit , killing a man and two children , she said . 
Almost all of the shops in the city were shut , she said . 
Along Tripoli Street , `` every single building has been hit by shells . '' 
Some bakery owners were giving away bread , and a few stores on the other side of town remained open , she said . 
As of Monday night , the seaside city remained surrounded on three sides , she said . 
Last week , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Khaim said that Gadhafi 's military was withdrawing from Misrata and that tribal leaders would deal with the rebels . 
But rebel commanders told Colvin that there were no negotiations going on between them and tribal leaders , the reporter said . 
The government 's assertion that such talks were ongoing `` appears to be a fig leaf or Gadhafi trying to cover the fact that his troops have been defeated , '' Colvin said . 
Misrata has been the scene of some of the deadliest battles of the war as rebels attempt to oust Gadhafi , who has been in power for 42 years . 
At least 36 people were killed there Sunday , rebel spokesman Col. Ahmad Bani said Monday . 
In all , hundreds of people have been killed in the battle for the city , which has been under siege by Gadhafi 's forces for seven weeks . 
Its population of about 450,000 makes it the country 's third-largest city . 
But that number has been dropping as residents have sought to get out . 
On Monday , the International Organization for Migration said it had taken nearly 1,000 stranded migrants -- most of them from Nigeria -- and 17 civilian casualties from Misrata to Benghazi on Sunday , with more such efforts planned . 
The accounts of dire conditions in Misrata came as a government official said Gadhafi was well and in command of the country 's affairs , despite what the official called a NATO attempt to kill him by bombing his compound in the capital city of Tripoli . 
`` The message that was sent by NATO in the early hours of this morning was sent to the wrong address , '' Mussa Ibrahim said in a written statement . 
In a tour of the aftermath , Ibrahim said the flattened structure was a civilian office building . 
In a statement , NATO said the target was a communications center in central Tripoli that had been used to coordinate attacks against civilians . 
NATO is leading an international military operation in Libya that includes airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources . 
It is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians . 
On Monday , Italy 's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called U.S. President Barack Obama to tell him of his decision to provide additional military support by authorizing air-to-ground strikes on Libyan regime targets , the White House said in a statement . 
`` The two leaders agreed that additional pressure is necessary to strengthen the civilian protection mission , and the president emphasized that the best way to ensure the safety of the Libyan people is for Gadhafi to leave power , '' the statement said . 
Libyan state TV said military and civilian casualties resulted from the strike on Gadhafi 's Bab el-Azizia compound . 
`` We have no independent means of verifying reports of possible civilian casualties , '' NATO said in a statement on its website . 
NATO has been issuing warnings to Libyan civilians to stay away from military sites and equipment , especially around Misrata . 
Citing a military source , state-run Libyan TV reported late Monday that NATO ships struck an offshore fiber-optic cable , cutting communications to Sirte , Ras Lanuf and al-Brega . 
It also reported that air strikes hit targets Monday night in Zawiya and Ayn Zarah of Tripoli district , resulting in casualties . 
Since NATO took command of Operation Unified Protector on March 31 , its aircraft have flown more than 3,700 sorties and more than 1,500 strike sorties . 
Over the weekend , NATO aircraft destroyed multiple-rocket launchers , armored personnel carriers , bunkers and storage facilities in and around Misrata , Tripoli and Sirte , the alliance said . 
`` We are bringing all our capabilities to bear on all parts of the Gadhafi regime that remain intent on harming the civilian population , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said in a statement . 
`` As decided by the foreign ministers of NATO and operational partners , we will keep up the pressure until all attacks against civilians have stopped , Gadhafi 's forces have withdrawn to bases , and full and unimpeded humanitarian access has been ensured . '' 
The rebels , under the umbrella of the Transitional National Council , received a pledge Sunday from Kuwait for about $ 180 million . 
The announcement came during council chief Mustafa Abdel Jalil 's visit to Kuwait , Kuwaiti state-run television reported . 
CNN 's Kamal Ghattas , Barbara Starr , Kareem Khadder , Frederik Pleitgen , Reza Sayah and Saad Abedine contributed to this report .

2011-04-26,"Libyans in the besieged city of Misrata walk past a tank that belong to the forces of Col. Moammar Gadhafi . 
The U.S. and its allies have imposed a no-fly zone over Libya . 
Critics ask why U.S. military power has been used in Libya but not Syria Violence in Libya broke out before violence in Syria , one analyst notes International consensus on military action exists in Libya , but not in Syria , analysts say Assad has more friends and allies than Gadhafi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two countries , two cases of extreme violence committed against citizens by their own government . 
In one case , the Obama administration responds with military force . 
In the other , it does n't . 
The question has been raised in response to the radically different U.S. reactions to the bloodshed in Libya and Syria . 
More than 400 people have been killed in Syria over the past several weeks as Damascus has cracked down on protesters seeking reform , according to the Syrian Human Rights Information Link , a prominent human rights group . 
The United Nations says it has information that 76 people were killed in that country last Friday alone , apparently during peaceful marches . 
President Bashar al-Assad 's regime has described the protesters as `` armed criminal groups , '' and shows no sign of letting up . 
President Barack Obama has condemned the violence `` in the strongest possible terms '' and is seeking ways to `` increase the pressure on the regime ... in a targeted way , '' according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney . 
So far , however , the response has amounted to little more than talk . 
Over in Libya , however , the U.S. reaction was entirely different when strongman Moammar Gadhafi promised to show `` no mercy '' to residents of the rebel-held city of Benghazi . 
Washington worked furiously behind the scenes at the United Nations to win an international mandate for a naval blockade , a no-fly zone and a license to take military action to protect civilians . 
Obama promised no use of ground troops , but U.S. air power was used to devastating effect against elements of Gadhafi 's forces before control of the operation was handed over to NATO commanders . 
The White House says the two situations ca n't be compared . 
Why Syria different than Libya for U.S. Syrian protests spread despite violence Reporter in Misrata : ` We 're under siege ' Libya was `` a unique situation , '' Carney told reporters Monday . 
`` We had large portions of the country that were out of the control of Moammar Gadhafi -LRB- and -RRB- we had an international consensus to act . 
We had the support of the Arab League to act in a multilateral fashion . '' 
But Washington is `` pursuing a range of possible policy options '' in Syria , he stressed . 
The administration is looking at `` targeted sanctions to respond to the crackdown ... and to make clear that this behavior is unacceptable . '' 
American `` values and principles apply to all countries , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates added Tuesday . 
`` Our response in each country will have to be tailored to that country , and the circumstances peculiar to that country . '' 
Part of the reason the Obama administration intervened militarily in Libya and not Syria is because `` Libya happened first , '' noted Danielle Pletka , vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative Washington think tank . 
`` So the international community responded there first . '' 
Protests in Benghazi first broke out in mid-February . 
Protests in the Syrian city of Daraa started last month after a violent crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti . 
Second , there is `` nowhere near the consensus on Syria as there is on Libya , '' Pletka told CNN . 
Syria , as opposed to Libya , stands at the heart of the Arab world . 
Assad has more friends and allies to call on . 
`` Assad is a dictator , a sponsor of terrorism , -LRB- and -RRB- a thug , '' Pletka said . 
`` You could argue he 's worse than Gadhafi . '' 
But `` on Syria , the Arab League is not going to be nearly as forward-leaning . 
-LRB- They 're -RRB- much closer to Assad . '' 
Among other things , Gadhafi has been accused of trying to have then-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah assassinated in 2003 . 
There 's a `` personal antipathy '' factor between Gadhafi and other Arab leaders , Pletka said . 
At the same time , Israel may have a hostile relationship with its neighbor , but the Israeli leadership is `` very comfortable with the devil it knows '' in Damascus . 
Obama , Pletka said , has shown an extreme reluctance to engage in unilateral military action . 
Ousting Assad would change the entire political dynamic in the Middle East to the benefit of the United States , she said , noting Syria 's close ties to Iran and organizations such as Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad . 
But unless and until a firmer international consensus emerges , more concerted action is unlikely . 
Military action in Libya may also have became a priority partly due to fears of al Qaeda , according to Rick Nelson , a terrorism expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , another Washington think tank . 
Al Qaeda is `` good at using countries in chaos to carve out safe havens , '' Nelson said , noting that the second-highest number of foreign fighters for al Qaeda in Iraq came from Libya . 
As Libya became more unstable , it may have become a priority for Western powers to ensure the country does n't become more of a home for al Qaeda leaders . 
Nelson echoed Pletka 's point about the lack of an international consensus on Syria . 
`` People do n't want to be on Assad 's bad side , '' he said . 
If you attack Syria , `` you 're crossing a line that is changing the whole strategic calculus in the region in one move , '' he said . 
`` The stakes are a lot higher . ''

2011-04-26,"BRUSSELS | Tue Apr 26 , 2011 12:42 pm EDT BRUSSELS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Western bombing campaign in Libya is now in its sixth week but despite a series of eye-catching NATO initiatives there is little sign of a decisive military shift that will bring a quick end to the war . 
And there are few signs either of significant divisions within Muammar Gaddafi 's government that would hasten a political solution to the conflict . 
NATO , which took over the air campaign from a coalition led by France , Britain and the United States a month ago , can point to some successes in protecting civilian populations in eastern Libya from attack including in Benghazi and Ajdabiyah . 
But the siege of Misrata continues and the commander of the NATO operation , Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , conceded on Tuesday that the alliance had yet to remove the threat posed to civilians by Gaddafi 's forces . 
In the past week , a broadening of NATO 's bombing campaign to strikes on Gaddafi 's Tripoli compound , Washington 's announcement that it was deploying armed drones , and the withdrawal of government forces from central Misrata , might suggest the start of a shift away from a military stalemate . 
But analysts say these moves in part reflect a practical reality -- that an initial air campaign has run out of clear , purely military targets that are easy to hit without endangering civilians -- and the need for Western governments to maintain support for the effort by showing they are making a difference . 
`` Militarily , the fact is , the situation is not much different from what it was at the very beginning of the war , '' said French strategic analyst Francois Heisbourg . 
`` Gaddafi is essentially controlling the same territory as he was at the beginning of the war , so he is not likely to leave power readily as part of a negotiated deal . 
So from the standpoint of the coalition it 's not a great result . '' 
Shashank Joshi of London 's Royal United Services Institute said Gaddafi had shown himself a more adaptable and flexible adversary than the Western powers would have hoped . 
`` His forces have adapted extremely well , '' Joshi said . 
While there had been an escalation of the political aims of the Western mission , given the statement this month by the leaders of France , Britain and the United States pledging to continue the military campaign until Gaddafi gives up power , there was less sign of a stepping up of the military effort , Joshi said . 
`` People are synthesizing the bombing of Gaddafi 's compound and the introduction of drones and advisers to say this is an escalation . 
These are all incremental and will not make a difference in themselves . 
`` It 's actually a new way to compensate for the slowing of airstrikes , '' he said , referring to a decline in air activity since NATO took over the operation and the United States stepped back from an overt front-line role . 
Tomas Valasek of the Center for European Reform think tank said that despite NATO denials , it did appear the key alliance powers -- France , Britain and the United States -- were seeking a way around the Gaddafi dilemma by targeting him directly . 
`` NATO 's official mandate does n't involve removing Gaddafi from power , so the commanders would deny it and say they are going after communications posts and such , but to me it does smell that they are going after Gaddafi personally . 
`` That would mean a gap between what NATO collectively says it wants to do and what the French , the British and Americans say . 
That 's going to be a tough issue internally and it seems bound to create tensions within NATO , '' he said . 
Nick Witney of the European Council on Foreign Relations said French , British and U.S. leaders had put pressure on themselves by declaring their mission to be regime change . 
`` Unfortunately that 's something that can not be achieved by bombing , '' he said . 
`` There should be no particular time pressure on this , but you have to accept a war aim of disengagement , ceasefire and negotiations . 
It 's a mistake to conflate military action and regime change . '' 
Valasek said the fact that Britain , France and Italy were sending in military advisers showed they were aware they were unlikely to succeed quickly . 
`` It speaks of a long-term strategy , '' he said . 
`` They have a dilemma : there 's no end to the war without an end to the Gaddafi regime . 
And short of turning the rebels into a proper fighting force and supporting them from the air , there is no good way of forcing Gaddafi to resign . '' 
Any progress so far had been marginal , he said . 
`` To use a tug-of-war analogy , you are talking about a few inches left and right , '' he said . 
`` They 're still a mile way from the ultimate political end goal of removing Gaddafi from power . '' 
We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Given the fact that Israel has historically prioritized the goal of having substantial influence in our U.S. government , I 'm wondering how the government is dealing with the fact that an Israeli corporation , reportedly charging $ 2,000 per African mercenary while paying the mercenary $ 100\/day , is essentially turning what should have been a short conflict into an on-going business windfall . 
Likewise , I 'm wondering how it 's playing in Washington D.C. when the U.S. is sending U.S. pilots into a warzone whose Israeli-backed mercenaries are shooting at them while numerous pro-Israeli lobbyists , attorneys , government aides , and other Washington , D.C. influentials continue to shape policy concerning the war . 
If our purported friends are going to support our enemies then we need to determine who our friends really are before engaging in wars incapable of being won or assisting Israel in protecting itself against Middle East threats to it 's freedom and sovereignty only to watch it profiteer on the slaughter of students and civilians fighting for democratic freedom being choked by the grip of a mass-murdering psychopath . 
I was all for the U.S. assisting the rebels in fighting for democracy before I came to discover this unexpected obstacle . 
Now it appears as though this thing might very well drag out for years and years as we continue to send young , naive military personnel into a war knowing they are likely to be killed or wounded by our friends working against us . 
I 've never understood our relationship with Israel to begin with though I suspect it 's largely a product of Israeli influence within our own government . 
If that 's the case , then we need to identify pro-Israeli individuals who , by virtue of their political leanings , have a conflict of interest if they also occupy an influential or sensitive position within our own government or it 's civilian support system . 
Allowing someone to influence war decisions who is closely allied with the primary backer of our enemy is the grossest form of negligence . 
When a U.S. pilot is shot down with Israeli equipment and mercenaries , there will be no excuse that could work from any part of the Administration . 
If the government chooses to commit innocent military personnel to this good cause knowing that it will continue because Israel will continue support , then it is knowingly sending our young citizens into a perpetual meat grinder . 
You know how those work , do n't you ? 
Take a look at Viet Nam , Iraq , Afghanistan ? 
, and other protracted wars that took far longer than expected to reach a failing conclusion . 
This is the kind of BS that the American public is wretchedly disgusted with . 
It is the type of behavior that makes U.S. Citizens blindly enraged about our government . 
With the economy as it is , we might very well be the next country to have a revolution if our government becomes any more abusive of the poor and middle classes . 
What international friend would the U.S. Citizen revolutionaries call upon for help this time as the Founding Fathers did some 235 years ago by sending Benjamin Franklin to France to plead for assistance in rebelling against the British ? 
Could the U.S. Citizen revolutionaries count on France again to provide the support that changed the outcome of the Revolutionary War in 1776 and stopped the abuses of the British government ? 
It 's certainly possible again , I suppose . 
The French still love to love but they also love a good fight when it 's about right and wrong . 
They 're in Libya now spearheading the alliance . 
Could the U.S. Citizen revolutionaries count on Israel to help free them from an abusive government ? 
The first question one should ask is , what is NATO doing in this Libyo-Libyan war ? 
It is clearly a civil war . 
Why should NATO be involved in it ? 
Why should NATO side towards the rebels ? 
Why does NATO want to kill Khadafi ? 
One thing is clear , NATO is not involved in this civil war to protect the civilians . 
This is an excuse for intervention but is not the true reason , otherwise NATO should be involved in the unrest of other countries including Syria . 
NATO 's interest is purely economic ? 
Has Khadafi refused to renew or extend any oil contract with Britain ? 
This might be the case . 
Is Khadafi 's involvement in some African satellite communication projects affecting major communication companies in Europe ? 
Again , this seems to be the case . 
So , it might be that the involvement of NATO is a chastisement operation designed to punish Khadafi for not extending an oil contract and to cut down the revenues of a European communication company . 
And in this chastisement operation , thousands of Libyans have been killed by NATO bombs and billions of dollars ' worth of Libyan assets have been destroyed . 
Has NATO the right to kill people and destroy assets that belong to Libya ? 
Is this not a crime that should be severely punished ?

2011-04-26,"Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi -LRB- 2nd R -RRB- talks with Congo 's President Denis Sassou Nguessou -LRB- 2nd L -RRB- as they stand for photograph with South Africa 's President Jacob Zuma -LRB- L -RRB- and Mauritania 's President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz outside a tent in Gaddafi 's heavily fortified Bab al-Aziziya compound in Tripoli , April 10 , 2011 . 
ADDIS ABABA | Tue Apr 26 , 2011 10:37 am EDT ADDIS ABABA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The African Union on Tuesday accused Western nations of undermining its efforts to find a homegrown solution to the Libya conflict and said the civil war was in danger of becoming a stalemate . 
Libya 's foreign minister Abdelati Obeidi and representatives for the rebels have been meeting separately with AU officials in the Ethiopian capital since Monday to discuss an end to the war in the north African nation . 
`` I would like to point out that the pursuit of other agendas in Libya , by non-African actors , has had an impact on the implementation of the AU roadmap , '' Ramtane Lamamra , AU 's Commissioner for Peace and Security , told AU foreign ministers . 
`` Attempts have been made to marginalise an African solution to the crisis , specifically the timely implementation of the AU roadmap in a way that is fully consistent with and complementary to U.N. Security Council resolutions , '' he said in an open session . 
The war has split the oil producer , Africa 's fourth biggest , into a government-held western area round the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by ragged but dedicated rebels . 
The AU has rejected any form of outside intervention and proposed a solution that calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities followed by a transitional period and political dialogue . 
The rebels rejected the plan earlier this month , saying any settlement must include the departure of Muammar Gaddafi and his sons . 
The Libyan leader has vowed to fight to the death . 
Gaddafi is one of the AU 's most influential members , both ideologically and financially . 
As chair of the bloc in 2009 , he pushed for closer integration of member states , and he has been paying membership fees for several small countries who subscribe to the group . 
`` The imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya and aerial bombardment by the coalition , and now by NATO , have not brought a solution to the crisis , '' Lamamra said . 
`` In fact , the military situation on the ground seems to be sliding into a stalemate . '' 
The AU does not have a good track record in brokering peace deals , having failed recently to end conflicts or disputes in Somalia , Madagascar and Ivory Coast .

2011-04-27,"By Reza Sayah and Saad Abedine , CNN Bittersweet victory for Misrata rebels Sayah describes shelling by Gadhafi forces in Misrata Shelling comes days after regime official says operations had been suspended Shelling suggests regime is unwilling to give up key city Rebels say some rockets landed near refugee camps for migrant workers Editor 's note : CNN traveled to the city of Misrata , the brutal front line in the fight for control of Libya , to see the results of the battle between Gadhafi loyalists and rebels firsthand . 
Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We left Misrata with a human cargo of refugees and casualties on a ferry evacuating just a few hundred of the many thousands who would escape this port city if they could . 
We were heading for Benghazi , the Libyan rebels ' stronghold . 
Among those on board : hundreds of migrant workers and 30 medical cases with 50 relatives . 
We spoke to one migrant who left the city with just the clothes he was wearing . 
Like the majority of the 935 migrants on board , he was from Niger , one of Libya 's southern neighbors . 
He said he had spent three years working in Libya and was hopeful the future would be better . 
We left behind us a city that is front and center in the battle for Libya -- what the former shopkeepers of Misrata are calling a revolution for dignity . 
Homes destroyed in battle for Libya Are kids being trained to defend Gadhafi ? 
Libyan city looks like a wasteland It was a different atmosphere from that encountered during the apprehensive journey into Misrata after some 16-20 hours by sea from Benghazi , depending on the conditions . 
We were an hour away from Misrata when the shelling started and the city was again under fire . 
Our captain decided it was too dangerous to head into port , and there was no choice but to wait it out . 
The wait would be almost 24 hours . 
On board were humanitarian aid -- food and medical supplies - and aid workers eager to get into the city . 
As we waited , we could hear and see shelling and smoke rising . 
When we were finally able to land at Misrata port Wednesday morning , we saw one small office building destroyed after an alleged hit by regime forces . 
There was smoke rising from at least one other port location at but the location was not accessible and we could n't see what was hit . 
The office was hit by shells from Gadhafi 's forces on Tuesday night -- several days after a regime official said its troops had withdrawn from Misrata and suspended operations . 
Clearly , based on what we saw from the boat and during a trip into the city , that was not the case . 
The shelling seems to be an indication , a message from the regime that they are unwilling to give up this key city . 
There were many fighters on the streets but also some civilians . 
One father was driving his kids around showing them the destruction . 
His daughter , about five-years-old , was chanting `` Free Libya . '' 
He said he 'd told her Gadhafi was responsible for destroying their city . 
Most of the people we talked to had been shopkeepers or business owners a few weeks ago . 
They told us this was not a revolution for bread by the poor but for dignity , that they were sick of the Gadhafi regime . 
U.S. Ambassador to U.K. talks Libya Building frequented by Gadhafi hit Rebels described the overnight strikes as the most aggressive attack on the port area -- the city 's only lifeline to the outside world -- since this uprising began . 
Rebel officials said some of the rockets landed near refugee camps for migrant workers trapped in Misrata , and at least three people were killed and several others were injured . 
They also said the incoming rocket fire and shelling would have resumed if it were n't for NATO forces intervening . 
Several hours after the shelling of the port , NATO warplanes attacked Gadhafi 's ground forces outside Misrata . 
We heard and felt the vibrations of those air attacks . 
Misrata has been the most brutal theater in the war in Libya , and the frontline in the battle has been Tripoli Street . 
Some of the tallest buildings in Misrata are along Tripoli Street , and whoever controls those tall buildings owns the highest point in the city -- that 's an advantage in any battlefield and that 's why both sides were desperately fighting for it . 
Several days ago the rebels finally seized control of the last of those buildings from pro-Gadhafi gunmen . 
Tripoli Street is the major thoroughfare through the heart of town , and it used to be bustling with activity before the war , but the fighting has laid waste to much of it . 
We could n't find a single building that was n't damaged or destroyed . 
Inside one building -- until recently used by Gadhafi snipers to fire on the street below -- we saw empty shells on the floor and bullet holes in the walls . 
In one apartment people had left everything behind when it had been taken over by Gadhafi forces . 
The rebels may have won an important victory in capturing the main thoroughfare of Tripoli Street , but all indications are that there is more fighting to come here in Misrata .

2011-04-27,"WASHINGTON | Wed Apr 27 , 2011 4:27 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States voiced confidence in Libya 's main opposition council on Tuesday as the U.S. Treasury moved to permit oil deals with the group -- a potential financial lifeline for the anti-Gaddafi uprising . 
U.S. Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz said deepening contacts with the Benghazi-based Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- showed it was `` a political body which is worthy of our support '' although not yet full diplomatic recognition . 
`` They continue to say the right things . 
They are reaching out to the international community . 
They 're trying to be as inclusive as possible , '' Cretz , who is working in Washington to coordinate policy on the Libyan conflict , told reporters . 
The United States this week took steps to boost aid to the opposition council and to approve oil exports made under its auspices , creating a loophole in U.S. sanctions that could mean millions of dollars in revenue for rebel coffers . 
The order by the Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control covers oil transactions handled through Qatar Petroleum , which has agreed to help market oil for the council , or the Vitol group of companies . 
The order may help to clear up concerns among potential buyers over legal complications related to ownership of Libyan oil and the impact of international sanctions . 
A tanker with the first major oil shipment from rebel-held territory is expected to arrive in Singapore on Thursday for refueling before heading to China . 
The Treasury 's move on Libyan oil came as President Barack Obama on Tuesday approved the release of up to $ 25 million in nonlethal U.S. supplies and other aid to support groups , including the TNC , protecting civilians threatened by Muammar Gaddafi 's forces . 
The assistance , which could include items such as radios and military uniforms , comes atop some $ 47 million in U.S. emergency relief aimed at alleviating the humanitarian crisis caused by Libya 's civil war . 
Despite the increased assistance , Cretz said the United States had still not made a decision on formally recognizing the TNC -- a step that key allies including France , Italy and Qatar have already taken . 
Senator John McCain , on a recent visit to Libya , urged the Obama administration to give full recognition to the council and to transfer frozen Libyan assets to them . 
But Cretz said the United States was still studying the legal and procedural implications of such a move . 
A U.S. special envoy to the TNC , Chris Stevens , has been in Benghazi meeting with council leaders including Mustafa Abdel Jalil and military chief of staff Abdel Fattah Younes al Abidi who are spearheading the rebel drive to oust Gaddafi . 
`` They are working through the normal bugs that would be part of any stand-up transitional government ... in a country where you have not had politics for 40 years , '' Cretz said . 
`` As our mission is able to provide us more information , we will be looking at the different things that we might be able to do to step up cooperation . '' 
Cretz said other assistance , including possible arms transfers , remained under consideration but that no decision had yet been taken . 
Cretz said the United States and its allies continued to hear from members of Gaddafi 's government who wanted to break with the leader but were too terrified to do so . 
`` The time is fast approaching where they have to make the decision , and they can make a decision to either go down with the ship or else change sides , '' he said .

2011-04-28,"By the CNN Wire Staff Violent clashes continues in Libya NATO spokesman says he knew nothing about the reported deaths All buildings along Misrata 's major thoroughfare have been damaged or destroyed Human Rights Council team arrives for investigation Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A NATO airstrike Wednesday on the seaside town of Misrata killed 11 rebel fighters and wounded two others , witnesses told a reporter , who saw the bodies . 
Angry survivors told Marie Colvin of The Sunday Times that they and the victims were on the coast , east of a steel plant , when a NATO plane bombed them . 
There were no other planes in the sky , the survivors said . 
NATO spokesman Eric Povel said he knew nothing about the report and would likely not learn more for several hours . 
The incident occurred on a day in which pro-government forces launched the heaviest shelling yet on the port of Misrata , much of which appeared to be a wasteland , rebels said . 
`` I 'm looking around , I ca n't find a single building that 's not either damaged or destroyed , '' CNN 's Reza Sayah said from Tripoli Street , the city 's major thoroughfare . 
From the time NATO began its operation on March 31 until Tuesday , the organization had conducted 3,981 sorties , of which 1,658 were strike sorties , according to an update issued Wednesday . 
Ships chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- departed port Wednesday , carrying people intent on fleeing the violence . 
Are kids being trained to defend Gadhafi ? 
U.S. Ambassador to U.K. talks Libya Homes destroyed in battle for Libya The ICRC-chartered ship evacuated more than 600 civilians from the city , it said . 
The IOM-chartered ship was carrying about 935 migrants and Libyans en route to Benghazi , the organization said in a news release . 
Also aboard was a group of journalists , including a French journalist who was in intensive care after being shot in the neck , it said . 
In Washington , President Barack Obama on Wednesday authorized up to $ 25 million in nonlethal commodities and services to be made available to `` support key U.S. government partners such as the Transitional National Council in efforts to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack in Libya . '' 
The United States considers the Libyan opposition group the Transitional National Council worthy of U.S. support , but has not formally recognized the group , Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz said Wednesday . 
But Cretz said the lack of formal recognition has not stopped the United States from aiding and supporting the opposition . 
A three-member panel arrived in Libya on Wednesday to begin a U.N.-ordered inquiry into reports of violence and human rights abuses . 
The team , led by Professor Cherif Bassiouni , an Egyptian jurist and war crimes expert , was sent by the Human Rights Council . 
Last month , the U.N. General Assembly suspended Libya 's membership in the Human Rights Council . 
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Wednesday it has established an international aid presence in Tripoli , with humanitarian workers also in Benghazi and the neighboring countries of Tunisia , Egypt , Chad and Niger . 
Aid agencies are seeking about $ 310 million for relief operations and have received $ 129 million , the U.N. office said . 
Also Wednesday , government officials took reporters to the city of Tarhuna , south of Tripoli , where they said civilians were volunteering to be trained to defend Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from NATO . 
At a training camp there , reporters observed civilians learning basic military skills . 
Some of the volunteers appeared to be as young as 15 years old , the reporters said . 
Building frequented by Gadhafi hit NATO is leading an international military operation in Libya that includes airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources . 
It is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing any means necessary -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians . 
Witnesses said three people were killed and several were wounded after government shells detonated Tuesday near a refugee camp in the critical port area . 
Thousands of migrants have been housed there as they wait for ships to carry them to safety . 
Opposition forces said they believe that , had NATO forces not intervened with air attacks Tuesday night , the shelling would have continued . 
NATO said six military vehicles , seven technical vehicles and a surface-to-air missile launcher were targeted on Tuesday in the vicinity of Misrata . 
Though Gadhafi 's regime said last week that it was going to suspend operations in Misrata and let tribes deal with the rebels , heavy shelling suggests pro-government forces are n't done with the city . 
As many as 1,500 migrants are believed to remain in Misrata in need of evacuation , IOM said . 
In recent weeks , nearly 626,000 people have abandoned Libya for Tunisia , Egypt , Niger , Algeria , Chad and Sudan , it said . 
Some 615,000 people , including large numbers of third-country nationals , have fled Libya , more than 10,000 from Misrata . 
Misrata , the third-largest city in the North African country , has been hemmed in on three sides by Gadhafi 's forces . 
Though rebels said they had gained control of the city 's center and had pushed government forces outside the city , they said Gadhafi 's forces were continuing to attack Misrata with heavy weaponry . 
The port has served as a crucial route of escape and as a lifeline to humanitarian aid .

2011-04-28,"By Larry Shaughnessy , Pentagon Producer Maj. Kenneth Harney is welcomed home at RAF Lakenheath , England , on March 26 . 
Two Air Force fliers went down over Libya on March 21 Both were rescued , with the military keeping quiet on details Now , an Air Force video from their welcome-home ceremony provides some of the story `` You feel the weight of ... the entire military ... making sure you get home , '' says one Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For hours on March 21 , U.S. Air Force Maj. Kenneth Harney of Lexington , Kentucky , and Capt. Tyler Stark of Littleton , Colorado , were the focus of nearly every U.S. service member in the Mediterranean Sea region . 
Nearly a dozen aircraft , a platoon of Marines and even Libyan civilians worked to rescue Harney and Stark after their F-15 crashed in eastern Libya . 
Most details about the mission , including their names , were a closely held secret by the military . 
But earlier this month , with little notice , their identities and details of their rescue came out during a welcome-home ceremony at their air base . 
For the first time , the men spoke publicly to a small group of friends , family and Air Force personnel . 
The Air Force public affairs office posted pictures and video of the event on its official website , even after U.S. military public affairs officers involved in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya told CNN their names would never be made public . 
`` You feel the weight of not only the Air Force , but the entire military , focusing on you , making sure you get home , '' Stark said recently in a video prepared by the Air Force . 
At some point they ran into trouble . 
U.S. F-15 fighter jet crashes in Libya After the ejection , Harney -- `` Meso '' to his fellow fliers -- and `` Mask '' Stark became separated . 
`` When you find yourself alone , and you 're isolated , in a country where there 's hostiles , you are scared , '' said Harney , a veteran of both the Afghan and Iraq wars . 
Stark was found by Libyan civilians who protected him from possible retaliation by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , and eventually he was taken safely back to Europe . 
Details of how he was taken out of Libya have yet to be disclosed . 
Harney 's rescue came more quickly . 
He stayed in communications with another F-15 pilot still in the air over Libya . 
Eventually an MV-22 Osprey carrying Marines who were part of a Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel , or TRAP , team landed near his position . 
`` As that back door opened , I see a group of young Marine recon units jump out , and that was probably the best feeling I 've ever felt in my entire life , '' Harney said .

The struggle between forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his more than four decades of rule drew in outsiders last month , as NATO began air strikes on government troops under a United Nations mandate . 
But on Thursday the fighting spilled over Libya 's land frontier , when Gaddafi troops battled rebels on Tunisian territory for control of the Dehiba-Wazin frontier crossing . 
The incursion was brief and limited , and Gaddafi 's troops even apologised locally . 
But the response was nevertheless furious from Tunisia , where the Arab world 's wave of uprisings began late last year , leading to the overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January . 
Illustrating the difficulty of keeping the Libyan conflict sealed within the country 's land borders , artillery shells fired by Gaddafi forces also struck the Tunisian side of the crossing . 
Rebels seized the post a week ago , as it controls the only road link which their comrades in Libya 's Western Mountains have with the outside world , making them rely otherwise on rough tracks for supplies of food , fuel and medicine . 
After weeks of advances and retreats by rebel and government forces along the Mediterranean coast , fighting has settled into a pattern of clashes and skirmishes . 
Thursday 's battle for the crossing between Dehiba in Tunisia and Wazin on the Libyan side was typical of the fluid and confused conflict , which broke out in mid-February . 
First government troops stormed the post in what appeared to be part of a broader offensive to root out rebel outposts beyond their eastern heartland around Benghazi , Libya 's second city . 
Gaddafi 's soldiers apologised to their Tunisian counterparts for the incursion and hoisted their flag at the border , tearing down a pre-Gaddafi era flag that had fluttered for a few days . 
But then the rebels , who had retreated into Tunisia , counter-attacked and as the fog of war descended , rumors spread that the post was back in their hands . 
In the confusion , scores of vehicles headed for the border from the Tunisian side with civilians on board shouting `` We 've won ! 
We 've won ! '' 
but they swiftly turned back when they found Gaddafi 's forces were still there . 
In the port city of Misrata , the rebels ' biggest enclave in western Libya , the plight of residents worsened . 
Rebels accused Gaddafi 's forces of firing bigger rockets than the Russian-made Grad missiles largely used until now . 
A rebel called Marwan said in an audio statement on YouTube that the bigger rockets cause much greater destruction . 
`` Gaddafi the tyrant is trying to wipe out the city of Misrata , '' he said . 
Gaddafi denies his forces are attacking civilians and says his opponents are Islamist militants and foreign-backed agitators who deliberately put non-combatants in harm 's way . 
Rebel spokesman Abdelsalam said from Misrata that there had been sporadic clashes on the road to the port and shelling of residential areas . 
`` Those areas are packed with civilians who fled the fighting in the city center , '' he said . 
`` The ball is now in NATO 's court . 
After Gaddafi 's soldiers and snipers were driven out from the city center and Tripoli Street by the rebel fighters , their strategy has been to shell the city from the outskirts . 
This can only be solved by NATO . '' 
The Western alliance has been conducting air strikes on Libya since last month under a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for civilians to be protected . 
But military deadlock in Libya has exposed growing international rifts , with critics of NATO bombing calling it another case of the West trying to overthrow a government by stretching the terms of a U.N. resolution . 
At least two loud explosions were heard in Tripoli on Thursday night and NATO jets rumbled overhead . 
It was not immediately clear what the targets were . 
The official Libyan news agency Jana also said that `` the colonial , crusader aggression '' hit civilian and military sites in a Western Mountains region town on Thursday evening . 
Two people were killed and many others were wounded , it said . 
Gaddafi forces also took a town in the remote southeastern desert , state television reported . 
`` Libyan forces have seized full control of the town of Kufra and purified it of the armed gangs , '' it quoted a military spokesman as saying . 
But rebels denied this . 
`` The battle is not over and the situation is unclear , '' said spokesman Mohamed al-Muntasser .

2011-04-28,"UNITED NATIONS | Thu Apr 28 , 2011 8:59 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. envoy to the United Nations told the Security Council on Thursday that troops loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi were increasingly engaging in sexual violence and some had been issued the impotency drug Viagra , diplomats said . 
Several U.N. diplomats who attended a closed-door Security Council meeting on Libya told Reuters that U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice raised the Viagra issue in the context of increasing reports of sexual violence by Gaddafi 's troops . 
`` Rice raised that in the meeting but no one responded , '' a diplomat said on condition of anonymity . 
The allegation was first reported by a British newspaper . 
Pfizer Inc 's drug Viagra is used to treat impotence . 
Diplomats said if it were true that Gaddafi 's troops were being issued Viagra , it could indicate they were being encouraged by their commanders to engage in rape to terrorize the population in areas that have supported the rebels . 
That would constitute a war crime . 
Several diplomats said Rice provided no evidence for the Viagra allegation , which they said was made in an attempt to persuade doubters the conflict in Libya was not just a standard civil war but a much nastier fight in which Gaddafi is not afraid to order his troops to commit heinous acts . 
`` She spoke of reports of soldiers getting Viagra and raping , '' a diplomat said . 
`` She spoke of Gaddafi 's soldiers targeting children , and other atrocities . '' 
Rice 's statement , diplomats said , was aimed principally at countries like India , Russia and China , which have grown increasingly skeptical of the effectiveness of the NATO-led air strikes , which they fear have turned the conflict into a protracted civil war that will cause many civilian deaths . 
Most council members , diplomats said , had expected Gaddafi 's government to collapse quickly . 
They said the frustration felt by India , Russia and China would likely grow if the war dragged on . 
The use of rape as a weapon during wartime has received increasing attention at the United Nations . 
Last year , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a special envoy on sexual violence during armed conflict , Margot Wallstrom . 
Earlier this month , Wallstrom chided the Security Council for failing to mention sexual violence in two recent resolutions on Libya , despite having made the subject a priority . 
Wallstrom said at the time that reports of rape in Libya remained unconfirmed but she cited the highly publicized case of Eman al-Obaidi , the woman who burst into a journalists ' hotel in Tripoli last month saying she had been raped by pro-government militiamen . 
The International Criminal Court is already investigating whether Gaddafi 's government committed war crimes in its violent crackdown against demonstrators who demanded greater freedoms . 
The crackdown sparked a rebellion that has turned into a civil war .

2011-04-29,"By the CNN Wire Staff A wounded Libyan civilian arrives at a hospital on the western front of Misrata on April 28 , 2011 . 
NEW : NATO says Libyan forces intercepted while mining port At least nine dead , 30 wounded , a doctor says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Libyan government vowed Friday to sink any ship approaching the besieged port city of Misrata , essentially threatening NATO patrols and humanitarian aid ships that have been bringing in food and medical supplies and ferrying out refugees and the wounded Libya 's threat came hours after NATO said it intercepted Libyan government forces laying mines in Misrata 's harbor , which has been a lifeline for humanitarian aid in the months-long conflict between troops loyal to Moammar Gadhafi and rebels demanding an end to the dictator 's four-decade rule . 
NATO-led forces began bombing regime targets in Libya last month after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians . 
It also came as Gadhafi 's forces were shelling Misrata in an attempt to re-enter the city after being pushed out by rebels . 
Misrata , the country 's third-largest city , has been hemmed in on three sides for weeks by Gadhafi 's forces , leaving the sea as the only escape route . 
At least nine people were killed and another 30 were wounded in Friday 's attacks in Misrata , said a doctor , who is a member of the medical committee in the city . 
`` There is an indiscriminate shelling now in Misrata , '' said the doctor , who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution by Gadhafi 's forces . 
Rebels accused Gadhafi forces of dismantling rocket launchers so they would escape detection by NATO forces during transport , and then reassembling for use in attacking civilians , a spokesman for the rebels said . 
Bittersweet victory for Misrata rebels Libyan city looks like a wasteland NATO personnel Friday stopped small boats carrying pro-Gadhafi forces who were laying anti-ship mines in Misrata 's harbor , NATO spokesman Brig. Gen. Rob Weighill told reporters during a briefing in Brussels , Belgium . 
NATO warships were in the process of disarming and clearing the mines that had been laid , he said . 
Meanwhile , Libyan state TV announced that the Libyan military had successfully suppressed operations of the port . 
`` We will not allow any ship to dock at the port without being inspected by the Libyan government , '' Musa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , told reporters in Tripoli . 
He said any aid to Misrata must be delivered through designated land routes . 
Elsewhere , a senior rebel member , Omar al-Jernazi , told CNN that rebels `` took complete control '' Friday of Wazin -- a key Tunisian-Libyan border crossing -- after forcing Gadhafi forces to flee into Tunisia . 
The Tunisian army allowed Gadhafi 's troops to return to Libya at another border crossing , the rebel said . 
Meanwhile , thousands more Libyans fled to Tunisia , stirring further concerns about a humanitarian crisis there , according to Tunisia 's state-run news agency TAP , which cited Tunisian security sources . 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees set up more tents in the Remada refugee camp , it said .

2011-04-29,"By Mary Ellen O'Connell , Special to CNN U.S. has decided to use drone aircraft on behalf of Libyan rebels Mary Ellen O'Connell says drones wo n't accomplish U.S. goals or bring peace Drones may be a lower risk for U.S. forces , but they can kill civilians , she says O'Connell : Controlling the air through drones does n't mean controlling territory , which is key Editor 's note : Mary Ellen O'Connell holds the Robert and Marion Short Chair in Law and is research professor of international dispute resolution at the Kroc Institute for Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame . 
She is a specialist on the international law of armed conflict and is the author of `` The Power and Purpose of International Law '' -LRB- Oxford University Press , 2008 -RRB- . 
She has been a professional military educator for the U.S. Department of Defense , chaired the Use of Force Committee of the International Law Association -LRB- 2005-2010 -RRB- and is a vice president of the American Society of International Law . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Unmanned aerial combat vehicles , better known as Predator or Reaper drones , are sleek , small , flexible planes that look like gliders . 
They have capabilities that larger , heavier manned jet aircraft do not possess . 
Drones are cheaper to use than planes . 
If they are shot down , no U.S. pilot is killed or captured . 
And because they are unmanned , President Barack Obama uses them in places where , for political reasons , he does not want a significant U.S. military presence . 
Yet that is the fatal attraction of drones -- they may not seem like a weapon of war but they are . 
On Friday , CNN reported that the United States had begun using combat drones in Libya . 
CNN also reported that a drone attack in Pakistan had killed at least 25 people -- a third of them women and children . 
As this death toll demonstrates , drones are battlefield weapons . 
Predators and Reapers launch Hellfire missiles or drop bombs weighing up to 500 pounds -- firepower only permitted in armed conflict . 
The United States is not in an armed conflict in Pakistan ; it is not supposed to be in one in Libya . 
In Pakistan , despite continuous drone attacks since 2004 , the terrorism threat remains . 
In 2010 , the United States attacked more than 110 times , killing 600 to 700 people . 
Greg Miller of The Washington Post has reported that in all of those strikes only two people on a list of high-level terrorism suspects were killed . 
Top counterterrorism experts from the Rand Corp. to the Obama administration have said the use of military force , which includes combat drones , is counterproductive to the goal of ending terrorist groups . 
Bob Woodward revealed in his book , '' Obama 's Wars , '' that the president knows this : `` Despite the CIA 's love affair with unmanned aerial vehicles such as Predators , Obama understood with increasing clarity that the United States would not get a lasting , durable effect with drone attacks . '' 
Pakistanis protest U.S. drone action Bittersweet victory for Misrata rebels Fighting still raging in Misrata Drones are likely to be just as ineffective in Libya . 
The official U.S. aim there is civilian protection . 
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 of March 17 says the use of `` all necessary measures '' is authorized `` to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in '' Libya . 
The resolution responded to the imminent rout of Libyan rebels from Benghazi , and the fear that Libyan armed forces would exact revenge on civilians left behind . 
The resolution did not authorize outside intervention in a civil war . 
Indeed , an earlier resolution , Resolution 1970 , imposes a weapons embargo on all of Libya . 
Resolution 1973 continues that embargo with an exception to establish a `` no-fly '' zone and take other steps to protect civilians . 
After defending Benghazi , the U.S. should have turned immediately to seeking a peaceful end of the crisis . 
The U.S. rejected out of hand the African Union peace initiative , thereby putting no pressure on the rebels to come to the table . 
Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron instead took the new position that Moammar Gadhafi must go as a condition of ending the use of force . 
In this case , such a position is unlikely to help the cause of peace -- it only backs Gadhafi further into a corner . 
Each day the war continues , civilians are killed or die as a result of the fighting . 
Just as the fighting seemed to settle into a stalemate that could only be broken by negotiations at last -- the drones arrive . 
Their deployment appears set to move the conflict even further from a peaceful settlement . 
Even if the unlikely occurs and Gadhafi and his sons leave or are killed , continued fighting or chaos are predictable . 
Perhaps the U.S. aim is not primarily civilian protection but regime change ? 
If so , drone attacks will be no more helpful to that aim than to civilian protection . 
Air attacks can keep the rebels in the fight but can not win the war for them . 
A civil war can only be won by control of territory , not control of the air . 
Controlling territory requires military and civilian leadership , organization , training and equipment to defeat the Libyan army and replace the government . 
The rebels have deficits in all of these categories . 
Even if air attacks could buy NATO time to try to organize and train the rebels , Resolution 1970 does not permit arming the rebels . 
Sending drones to Libya is unlikely to bring the rebels a military victory . 
Drones are likely to prolong the fighting and the deaths of civilians . 
Sending drones does not even help Obama keep his promise that NATO would take the lead . 
Drones controlled by the U.S. deploy major military force . 
Drones give the appearance of a sophisticated , high-tech policy , not involving a big U.S. military presence . 
What they really give us is death and destruction that will not lead to the end of terrorism in Pakistan -- or peace in Libya . 
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Ellen O'Connell .

2011-04-29,"UNITED NATIONS | Fri Apr 29 , 2011 5:34 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. envoy to the United Nations told the Security Council on Thursday that troops loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi were increasingly engaging in sexual violence and some had been issued the impotency drug Viagra , diplomats said .

2011-05-01,"NEW : Empty Western embassies are vandalized after Gadhafi 's son is reported dead NEW : Russia says it has `` serious doubts '' about NATO 's targeting A NATO airstrike also killed 3 Gadhafi grandchildren , the Libyan government says The government vows to `` make Libya the grave of all invaders '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Libyan government said Sunday that ruler Moammar Gadhafi 's son and three of his grandchildren died in a NATO airstrike that the longtime strongman and his wife survived . 
Gadhafi and his wife were in their son 's house when it was targeted , but they are in good health , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told journalists . 
But the son , Saif al-Arab Gadhafi , and three of his children were killed , Ibrahim said . 
The Libyan government vowed to retaliate with death to `` invaders '' in the nation , and empty Western embassies were vandalized on Sunday , U.S. and Italian officials said . 
But CNN could not independently confirm the reported fatalities , and a spokesman for anti-Gadhafi rebels cast doubt on the claim even as it provoked celebratory gunfire in rebel-held Benghazi . 
Ibrahim slammed NATO after the airstrike , calling the attack an illegal act and a `` war crime . '' 
He said the 29-year-old son killed was a student in Germany , the sixth of eight children . 
The strike destroyed the house in Tripoli , leaving a massive crater . 
Saif al-Arab Gadhafi is one of two sons of the Libyan leader whose names begin with Saif . 
Another son -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- had previously touted reform , but has emerged as one of his father 's most visible defenders in recent months . 
The commander of the NATO operation , Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , said NATO was aware of `` unconfirmed media reports '' that members of Gadhafi 's family had been killed in an airstrike . 
`` We regret all loss of life , especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict , '' said Bouchard , a Canadian air force general . 
But he said all targets `` are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime 's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals . '' 
But Russia , which has criticized the allied campaign , said it had `` serious doubts '' about NATO 's assertion that it is not targeting Gadhafi and his family . 
`` The disproportional use of force , all the more so , beyond the mandate of U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 1973 , which in no way stipulates the replacement of the Libyan leadership , is leading to harmful consequences and the death of civilians , '' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official RIA Novosti news agency . 
`` We are again calling for strict compliance with the provisions of the decisions made by the international community on the Libyan conflict , for an immediate cease-fire and the start of a political settlement without any preconditions . '' 
The airstrikes started March 19 , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians demanding the ouster of the ruler , who has been in power for nearly 42 years . 
A senior official in President Barack Obama 's administration said the U.S. government is `` very aware '' of the reports of Gadhafi 's son 's death , but can not confirm who , if anyone , died in a strike until they see the evidence . 
Gunfire broke out around Tripoli after the news came out . 
A crowd of demonstrators gathered around the ruler 's compound . 
Images on Libyan state TV showed what appeared to be dozens of people chanting and waving flags . 
Protesters could be heard yelling , `` We want to redeem the martyr , '' and , `` Oh youth , this is time for jihad . '' 
They were joined at one point by Ibrahim , who told the demonstrators , `` Every one of you are Saif al-Arab . '' 
`` We will make Libya the grave of all invaders , '' he told the crowd . 
A spokesman for the Libyan opposition doubted the report of the death . 
`` In all honesty , we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising , '' said Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi . 
`` We do n't believe this is true , '' Ghoga said . 
`` It is all fabrications by the regime in a desperate attempt to get sympathy . 
... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying . '' 
Despite skepticism by some rebels , some opposition members celebrated the report of Saif al-Arab 's death in the streets of Benghazi . 
Revelers danced and sang overnight as the sound of celebratory gunfire pierced through the air . 
`` By God , we 're not supposed to rejoice anyone 's death , '' one man told CNN . 
`` But we want him to feel the pain and sorrow that we 're going through with our own people he killed . '' 
Many of the reported civilian deaths have come out of the western city of Misrata . 
On Sunday , a witness there described especially intense shelling by government forces in the country 's third-largest city and speculated that the intensified attacks were tied directly to reports of the death of Gadhafi 's son . 
This is not the first time the ruler has reportedly been at the site of an airstrike that killed one of his children . 
In April 1986 , his adopted daughter , Hanna Gadhafi , was killed when U.S. forces launched an airstrike that targeted his residential compound . 
At the time , U.S. President Ronald Reagan said the strikes were an act of self-defense following the bombing of a West Berlin , Germany , club that killed two American servicemen and injured several others .

2011-05-01,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan rebels on patrol near the airport at al-Ghiran close to the key port city of Misrata on April 30 , 2011 . 
NEW : The Libyan government says it regrets the attacks on foreign embassies State TV reports a funeral procession and burial will be held on Monday Witnesses report heavy fire from pro-Gadhafi forces in Misrata and Benghazi One man thinks it is `` revenge '' for a strike that reportedly killed one of Gadhafi 's sons Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Government forces pounded rebel-held cities and crowds ransacked empty embassies in Tripoli on Sunday after Libyan authorities reported a NATO airstrike killed one of longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi 's sons and three of his grandchildren . 
The U.S. Embassy was attacked by what one U.S. official called an `` organized mob , '' along with the British , French , Italian and Qatari embassies , British and Italian officials told CNN . 
Meanwhile , pro-Gadhafi forces stepped up their shelling of rebel positions in Misrata after Libya 's government reported the deaths . 
`` It 's going to be like revenge , '' one eyewitness in the embattled coastal city of Misrata said . 
The eyewitness reported significant damage and some casualties in Misrata , the country 's third-largest city . 
The city remains in rebel hands , with no forces aligned with Gadhafi remaining in the city itself , he said . 
Another witness , who agreed to be identified only as Mohammed , said `` very heavy shelling '' targeted the coastal city 's port . 
`` I have been here during all days of the conflict , '' he told CNN . 
`` Last night was the worst . '' 
And a third man , who wanted to be identified only as Abdsalam , said the port was heavily bombarded . 
Electricity is out in nearly the entire city , and food and fresh water are running scarce , he said . 
`` They are using every every possible type of weapon , '' he said . 
The Libyan government said Sunday that Gadhafi 's son , Saif al-Arab Gadhafi , and three grandchildren died in the strike that destroyed the son 's home in Tripoli . 
The Libyan government identified the children as Saif al-Arab 's sons Gartaj Hannibal Muammar al-Gadhafi , age 3 , and 2-year-old Saif Mohammad al-Gadhafi , as well as Mastoura Hamid Abuzitaia , the daughter of the leader 's daughter Aysha . 
State TV aired video of two bodies , wrapped in white shrouds and draped with flags , one of which was reported to be the body of Gadhafi 's son . 
A funeral procession and burial for the fallen `` martyrs '' will be held on Monday , state TV said . 
The Libyan leader and his wife were in the house when it was targeted , but they are in good health , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told journalists . 
The building was in a residential area of Tripoli that houses several embassies . 
Ibrahim called the bombing a `` war crime . '' 
The strike destroyed the two-bedroom , single-story house , leaving a massive crater in its place . 
CNN could not independently confirm the reports , and NATO said in a statement Sunday that the alliance was `` aware of unconfirmed media reports that some of Gadhafi 's family members may have been killed . '' 
`` We regret all loss of life , especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's military operations . 
However , Bouchard said , all targets `` are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime 's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals . '' 
But U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham , a leading supporter of the Libya campaign , called the elder Gadhafi a `` murderer '' and `` a legitimate military target . '' 
`` He 's not the legitimate leader of Libya , and the way to get this to end is to go after the people around him and his support system , '' Graham told `` Fox News Sunday . '' 
The South Carolina Republican is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee . 
In Benghazi , a hub for rebel forces and their transitional government , the news triggered celebratory gunfire even as a rebel spokesman dismissed the reported death as `` a desperate attempt to get sympathy . '' 
`` In all honesty , we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising , '' said Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi , on Sunday . 
`` We do n't believe this is true ... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying , '' he added . 
Opposition members , citing witness reports , also warned that pro-Gadhafi troops in the town of Zintan , 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- west of Misrata , and other nearby areas have been equipped with gas masks . 
The opposition figures say that suggests the government forces are preparing to use chemical weapons against rebel forces -- but the accounts lacked detail , and CNN could not independently confirm the reports . 
Ibrahim dismissed the allegations as `` all lies . '' 
`` Every time they come with a lie , they jump out to the next lie , '' he said . 
`` The media can not report from one side of reports . 
It is the same lie when they said we are using cluster bombs . '' 
Human Rights Watch reported in mid-April that pro-Gadhafi troops were firing cluster munitions into Misrata and displayed a portion of a Spanish-made mortar shell that releases 21 smaller bombs across a wide area . 
The Libyan government denies the allegation . 
Fighting also intensified Sunday near the rebel-held Djerba border crossing into Tunisia , witnesses and Tunisia 's state news agency reported . 
The TAP news agency said the flow of refugees out of Libya had slowed , possibly as a result . 
NATO began bombarding Libya on March 19 , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
The alliance said it targeted a `` command-and-control building '' in Tripoli on Saturday , as well as hit seven ammunition depots around the capital . 
According to a NATO military official , the airstrike that Libya says killed Gadhafi 's son involved four precision-targeted bombs , one of which failed to detonate . 
The official , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter , said the alliance was certain the target was a command-and-control facility and said the building hit , although above ground , had reinforced portions . 
The official said NATO had `` no evidence '' that Gadhafi 's relatives had been killed . 
A photograph of the site showed the unexploded bomb , a 2,000-pound weapon designed to penetrate reinforced concrete , but NATO would not confirm what other types of ordnance may have been dropped . 
Nor would it disclose which nation 's aircraft carried out the strike , or what type of aircraft were used . 
Libyan officials attacked the U.S. Embassy compound in Tripoli Sunday , as well as the British , French and Italian missions , according to a senior U.S. official in Washington . 
All four NATO nations are taking part in the airstrikes . 
Mark Toner , a U.S. State Department spokesman , said he had seen reports of violence against the diplomatic facilities and that if true , `` we condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms . '' 
Italian officials told CNN that the embassy of Qatar , a Gulf Arab state that supports the campaign and is supplying arms to the rebels , was also targeted . 
The senior U.S. official said Turkey , the protecting power for U.S. interests in Libya , is trying to keep an eye on the American compound -- but `` there is n't much they can do when you have an organized mob , as this appeared to be . '' 
In London , British Foreign Secretary William Hague expelled Libya 's ambassador to the United Kingdom after the attacks . 
Hague said the Tripoli government is breaching its international obligation to protect diplomatic missions by allowing the vandalism . 
`` The attacks against diplomatic missions will not weaken our resolve to protect the civilian population in Libya , '' Hague said . 
Ibrahim told CNN the attacks happened because `` the people were upset '' and that Libyan security forces stopped the attacks and prevented the embassies from being destroyed . 
`` There are embassies that have not been touched , '' he said . 
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said later the government deeply regrets the looting and violence at the embassies . 
Angry crowds simply overwhelmed police , he said . 
In addition , 12 U.N. international staffers left Tripoli because of the unrest and are in Tunisia , the world body said Sunday . 
Spokeswoman Eri Kaneko said the United Nations would not identify the staffers or their agencies for safety reasons . 
U.N. national staffers are still in the country and international staffers remain in Benghazi .

TRIPOLI | Sun May 1 , 2011 6:03 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya said Sunday Muammar Gaddafi 's youngest son and three grandchildren were killed in a NATO air strike and Britain said that while it was not targeting the leader , it was homing in on his military machine . 
Libyan government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said Gaddafi was unharmed and in good health despite what he called `` a direct operation to assassinate the leader of this country . '' 
The deaths have not been independently confirmed . 
But they will be sure to heap pressure on NATO from critics who say it is overstepping a U.N. mandate to protect Libyan civilians and could trigger a backlash against the West and a renewed government push against rebels supported by the strikes . 
Britain and Italy 's embassies in Tripoli were attacked after Gaddafi loyalists were shown on Libyan television vowing vengeance following the air strike . 
Britain expelled the Libyan ambassador and Italy condemned the attack on its embassy as a grave and vile act . 
Most Western countries closed their embassies in Tripoli before the NATO military intervention began several weeks ago . 
Libyan officials took journalists to a Tripoli house that had been hit by at least three missiles . 
The roof had collapsed in places . 
Glass and debris covered the lawns and what appeared to be an unexploded missile lay in one corner . 
`` What we have now is the law of the jungle , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` We think now it is clear to everyone that what is happening in Libya has nothing to do with the protection of civilians . '' 
Libya 's civil war , which grew out street demonstrations for greater political freedoms that have rippled across the Arab world , has reached stalemate in recent weeks . 
NATO denied targeting Gaddafi , or his family , but said in a statement it had launched air strikes on military targets in the same area of Tripoli as the bombed site seen by reporters . 
Ibrahim said Gaddafi 's youngest son , Saif al-Arab , was killed in the attack . 
Saif al-Arab , 29 , is one of Gaddafi 's less prominent sons , with a limited role in the power structure . 
Ibrahim described him as a student who had studied in Germany . 
Al Arabiya Sunday broadcast footage taken from Libyan Jamahiriyah TV which it said were the bodies of Saif al-Arab and the three children -- two 2-year-olds and a five-month-old . 
They were wrapped in green cloth with their faces covered in white . 
`` NATO continued its precision strikes against regime military installations in Tripoli overnight , including striking a known command and control building in the Bab al-Aziziyah neighborhood shortly after 1800 GMT Saturday , '' NATO said . 
NATO 's commander of Libya operations , Canadian Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , said the target was part of a strategy to hit command centers that threaten civilians . 
`` All NATO 's targets are military in nature ... We do not target individuals , '' he said in a statement . 
`` I am aware of unconfirmed media reports that some of Gaddafi 's family members may have been killed . 
We regret all loss of life . '' 
Any appearance of an assassination attempt against Gaddafi is likely to lead to accusations that the British - and French-led strikes are exceeding the provisions of the U.N. resolution to protect civilians . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron declined to comment on what he also called the `` unconfirmed report . '' 
But he told BBC television : `` The targeting policy of NATO and the alliance is absolutely clear . 
It is in line with U.N. Resolution 1973 and it is about preventing a loss of civilian life by targeting Gaddafi 's war-making machine . 
So that is obviously tanks and guns , rocket launchers , but also command and control as well . '' 
The French Foreign Ministry said : `` France is following its mandate from the U.N. Security Council and there is no question of regime change or targeting individuals in the resolution . '' 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a long-time ally of Gaddafi , called the attack attempted murder . 
Gaddafi , who seized power in a 1969 coup , is fighting an uprising by rebels who have seized much of eastern Libya . 
He describes the rebels as religious extremists and Western agents who seek to control Libya 's oil . 
Saturday night 's attack appeared to be the second NATO strike near to Gaddafi in 24 hours . 
A missile struck near a television station early Saturday when the Libyan leader was making an address in which he said he would never step down and offered talks to rebels . 
The rebels say they can not trust Gaddafi . 
Gaddafi 's daughter was killed in a U.S. air strike in 1986 , ordered after a bomb attack on a West Berlin discotheque killed two U.S. servicemen . 
Washington linked Tripoli to the attack . 
Tripoli has declared a sea blockade on the besieged western outpost of Misrata , potentially stopping the rebels from sending weapons and humanitarian supplies in from their eastern heartland . 
An International Organization for Migration ship , the Red Star One , was waiting offshore to deliver aid and evacuate migrants . 
A rebel spokesman reported more shelling in Misrata . 
`` The bombardment started last night . 
It is still going on , '' the spokesman , called Reda , told Reuters by telephone . 
`` The random bombardment targeted residential areas and the port area . 
I can hear explosions now . '' 
Rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan said later that the Libyan army was shelling where an aid ship was trying to unload . 
Libyan TV said government forces were trying to stop a NATO arms delivery to `` armed criminal gangs . '' 
A third rebel spokesman said government forces and rebels were fighting for control of the airport near Misrata . 
Pockets of fighting continued elsewhere in the west . 
Government forces were bombarding Zintan with rockets to try to advance on the rebel-held city southwest of Tripoli , and the rebels said NATO was bombing Libyan army positions nearby . 
Loyalists ' artillery fire also landed in the Tunisian border town of Dehiba after fighting on the Libyan side of the border . 
A rebel spokesman and an oil official said an air strike destroyed a Gaddafi convoy after his forces killed five civilians in fighting in the eastern towns of Jalu and Awlijah . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It is a war . 
two wrongs do n't make a right . 
Even if Gaddafi is wrong in do many areas , killing children is never right . 
Did n't NATO pledge not to target the Libyan leader for bombing ? 
Why they do it now ? 
The rebels can overthrow Gaddafi by themselves but they will not be accredited for completing this job if NATO lends such helping hand . 
We want the war , if persists , to go fair . 
Gaddafi should have offered surrender instead of ceasefire yesterday so his son would n't die for him . 
NATO did this becoz the West is not patient with continued disrupted cheap oil supply from Libya .

`` What we have now is the law of the jungle , '' government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim told a news conference . 
`` We think now it is clear to everyone that what is happening in Libya has nothing to do with the protection of civilians . '' 
Gaddafi , who seized power in a 1969 coup , is fighting an uprising by rebels who have seized much of the eastern part of the country . 
British and French-led NATO forces are permitted under a United Nations resolution to mount air attacks on Gaddafi forces to protect civilians . 
There was no immediate NATO reaction or any independent confirmation of the deaths . 
Gaddafi had appeared on television in the early hours of Saturday and said he would never step down . 
He offered talks to the rebels , who rejected the proposal as hollow and treacherous . 
Libya 's government took journalists to the house , which had been hit by at least three missiles . 
The roof had completely caved in in some areas , leaving mangled rods of reinforcing steel hanging down among chunks of concrete . 
A table football machine stood outside in the garden of the house , in a wealthy residential area of Tripoli . 
Glass and debris covered the lawns and what appeared to be an unexploded missile lay in one corner . 
Inside one part of the villa , a beige corner sofa was virtually untouched , but debris had caved in on other striped upholstered chairs . 
The blasts had been heard across the city late on Saturday . 
Rifle fire and car horns rang out in the rebels ' eastern capital of Benghazi as news of the attack spread . 
`` The leader himself is in good health . 
He was n't harmed , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` His wife is also in good health . 
`` This was a direct operation to assassinate the leader of this country . 
This is not permitted by international law . 
It is not permitted by any moral code or principle . '' 
He said Gaddafi 's youngest son , Saif Al-Arab , had been killed in the attack . 
Saif al-Arab , 29 , is one of Gaddafi 's less prominent sons , with a limited role in the power structure . 
Ibrahim described him as a student who had studied in Germany . 
`` We will fight and fight if we have to , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` The leader offered peace to NATO yesterday and NATO rejected it . '' 
Fighting in Libya 's civil war , which grew from protests for greater political freedom that have spread across the Arab world , has reached stalemate in recent weeks with neither side capable of achieving a decisive blow . 
Libyan forces had reached the gates of Benghazi last month when Gaddafi appeared on television declaring he would crush the rebellion , showing `` no pity , no mercy . '' 
Days later the United Nations passed its resolution allowing the air strikes and saving the rebels from defeat .

2011-05-02,"NEW YORK | Mon May 2 , 2011 6:56 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - International Criminal Court investigators have proof that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces committed crimes against humanity , and the court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , said on Monday he would soon ask for up to five arrest warrants . 
The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously in February to refer Gaddafi 's violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrators to The Hague-based ICC and Moreno-Ocampo said his first recommendations for indictments should reach ICC judges within weeks . 
`` We have strong evidence on the beginning of the conflict , the shooting of civilians , '' he told Reuters in an interview , noting that killing unarmed civilians would qualify as a crime against humanity . 
`` Also , we have strong evidence of the crime of persecution , '' he said . 
This includes `` massive arrests and torture of people , and some forced disappearances ... -LRB- for -RRB- talking to journalists or going to demonstrations . '' 
Without giving precise details of his proof , Moreno-Ocampo said `` for these two crimes we have a lot of evidence . '' 
He plans to brief the Security Council on his probe on Wednesday . 
Once Moreno-Ocampo makes his recommendations to the ICC 's pretrial chamber , the judges must decide whether there are sufficient grounds to issue arrest warrants . 
Moreno-Ocampo said he would initially ask for up to five arrest warrants , but disclosed no names . 
It is not clear whether NATO would be involved in the implementation of any future warrants . 
The Security Council has a mandate to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . 
Enforcing ICC warrants would require it to target individuals for capture and transfer them to The Hague . 
Permanent veto-wielding council members Russia and China have become increasingly critical of the U.N.-backed intervention to protect civilians in Libya . 
U.N. diplomats say Moscow and Beijing have complained privately and publicly that the operation is targeting Gaddafi and his family . 
The ICC is also looking at the rebel camp , which has been fighting Gaddafi 's forces since February in what is now a full-scale civil war that Western officials say is deadlocked . 
Moreno-Ocampo said the court was probing allegations that the rebels attacked black Africans in Libya , whom they assumed to be mercenaries aiding Gaddafi 's forces . 
Western officials and Libyan rebels have said that nationals from Chad , Niger and other African states have been among the mercenaries in Libya . 
The rebels have pledged to cooperate with the ICC , Moreno-Ocampo said , while Gaddafi 's government has not responded to the court 's requests for information . 
ICC investigators are also looking into allegations that Gaddafi 's forces have used rape as a weapon . 
As part of the investigation of alleged rapes , Moreno-Ocampo said , the ICC is looking at allegations that some of Gaddafi 's soldiers have been issued packets of the popular anti-impotence drug Viagra from Pfizer Inc. . 
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice brought the Viagra charge up in a meeting of the Security Council last week , council diplomats said . 
If it were true that Gaddafi 's troops were being issued Viagra , diplomats said , it could indicate they were being encouraged by their commanders to engage in rape to terrorize the population in areas that have supported the rebels . 
`` We are trying to confirm this public announcement through evidence so it can stand in court , '' Moreno-Ocampo said . 
`` In some other conflicts you have had some battalions that are just devoted to rape . '' 
He said the ICC was investigating other alleged war crimes charges against Gaddafi 's forces , including the use of cluster bombs in civilian areas . 
We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

2011-05-03,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue May 3 , 2011 6:41 am EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's rebel leadership expects foreign powers to lend it $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion secured against frozen Libyan state assets held abroad , a rebel finance official said on Tuesday . 
Libya 's economy depends almost entirely on oil and the rebels have struggled to revive crude exports since taking control of the east of the country from Muammar Gaddafi in February , leaving them low on funds . 
Ali Tarhouni , who heads the rebel national council 's finance committee , said the rebels were spending between 50 million to 100 million Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 43 million-86 million -RRB- per day . 
`` The liquidity that we have domestically most likely will carry us at this rate for three weeks or at the most four weeks , '' Tarhouni said . 
He expected foreign governments such as France , Italy and the United States to extend the lines of credit and the money should arrive within a week to ten days . 
`` I need about $ 2-3 billion and we are hoping to get most or all of this , '' Tarhouni told reporters in the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
`` That will last me for three months . '' 
With Libya 's economy in tatters after more than two months of civil war , funds to pay for food , medicine and the state salaries on which most of the population depends are running low . 
The insurgents had been hoping for a swift overthrow of Gaddafi but his better-trained and better-equipped militias halted the rebel advance west and forced a stalemate in the fighting that could last months . 
`` We are still discovering different segments that need to be paid that we thought were paid , '' said Tarhouni . 
`` At every single moment another need arises in terms of food , medicine and in terms of people who are injured . '' 
Supplies of fuel -- vital to keeping eastern towns supplied and maintain the military campaign against Gaddafi -- are also tight .

2011-05-04,"By the CNN Wire Staff War crimes threat against Gadhafi ? 
NEW : The U.S. is making available an additional $ 6.5 million for emergency assistance An International Criminal Court report cites `` reasonable grounds '' Arrests `` will contribute to the protection of civilians in Libya , '' it says The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. warns those around Gadhafi of tying their fate to his -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court said in a report Wednesday there are `` reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed and continue being committed in Libya . '' 
The report highlighted the alleged commission of rape by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's government , as well as the deportation or forcible transfer of citizens during the civil war that continues to rage in that country . 
It also noted war crimes , including intentionally directing attacks against civilians not participating in the fighting . 
ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo issued a statement saying he will soon request arrest warrants against three individuals who are `` most responsible for the crimes committed . '' 
The individuals were not named . 
`` It is indeed a characteristic of the situation in Libya that massive crimes are reportedly committed upon instruction of a few persons who control the organizations that execute the orders , '' the report said . 
`` Arresting those who ordered the commission of crimes , should the judges decide to issue warrants , will contribute to the protection of civilians in Libya . '' 
In March , shortly after the International Criminal Court was asked to investigate the issue , a court spokeswoman said Gadhafi would probably face serious charges . 
But the prosecutor did not name the people against whom he had evidence . 
`` Even today , people in Tripoli are arrested illegally , tortured and they disappear , '' Moreno-Ocampo told CNN . 
`` We have evidence of that and we will show it to the judges . '' 
It is not clear if he plans to file charges against anyone on the rebel side , though the report mentioned `` alleged war crimes as well as other crimes against humanity '' appear to have been committed by `` different parties . '' 
He warned when he opened the probe two months ago that the rebels are subject to international law just as Gadhafi 's forces are . 
`` Now , there are people opposing Gadhafi with weapons . 
And also we would like to warn them , you can not commit crimes . 
Our business in Libya is -LRB- to -RRB- stop the crimes , '' he told CNN in March . 
Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said the specter of ICC prosecution `` should warn those around Gadhafi about the perils of continuing to tie their fate to his . '' 
`` Gadhafi has lost any and all legitimacy to lead Libya , '' she said , remarking on `` widespread and systematic attacks '' against civilians by government forces . 
Her comments were later echoed by the acting deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department , Mark Toner , who called on Gadhafi to cease hostilities and to `` allow the International Organization for Migration and other organizations to provide much needed relief and evacuation services to civilians caught up in the Libyan conflict . '' 
He said the United States is making available an additional $ 6.5 million for the migration organization 's operations in Libya . 
That means the United States now is shelling out a total of $ 53.5 million in emergency assistance `` to meet the humanitarian needs of conflict victims , vulnerable migrants , and others displaced by the civil unrest in Libya , '' he said . 
But the Russian ambassador to the United Nations said Russia is `` deeply alarmed by the growing number of civilian causalities and the destruction of civilian facilities as a result of the actions by opposing Libyan parties . '' 
`` Unfortunately it must be noted that actions by NATO-led coalition forces also lead to civilian causalities , '' said Ambassador Vitaly Churkin . 
`` This took place in particular during recent bombings in Tripoli . '' 
He warned against exceeding the mandate established by U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 , which allows military action in Libya to protect civilians . 
`` Any disproportionate use of force is unacceptable , '' he said . 
This is the first time the International Criminal Court has begun investigating possible crimes against humanity as they were occurring in wartime , Moreno-Ocampo said . 
Social networking websites such as Facebook were part of the reason that was possible , he said . 
`` This triggered a very quick reaction . 
The -LRB- United Nations -RRB- Security Council reacted in a few days , the U.N. General Assembly reacted in a few days . 
So , now because the Court is up and running we can do this immediately , '' he said . 
`` I think Libya is a new world , '' he added . 
`` How we manage the new challenge , that 's what we will see now . '' 
The United Kingdom used Wednesday 's meeting to support investigations in Libya , while also using the forum to urge Syria not to attack protesting civilians . 
`` The deteriorating situation in Syria is of increasing concern in this regard , '' said Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant . 
`` The violent repression there must stop immediately . '' 
Meanwhile , Gadhafi 's forces once again shelled Misrata 's port on Wednesday , leaving five people dead and dozens injured , a rebel spokesman told CNN . 
The shelling started around 1 p.m. `` This is the only terminal we have for the city and for humanitarian vessels to come in and take foreigners out , '' rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan said . 
A few ambulances and private cars arrived on the scene to take the casualties away after the shelling stopped . 
The International Organization for Migration told CNN that it had one chartered vessel that entered Misrata 's port early Wednesday morning . 
Contact was made with the ship 's captain , and no one was injured on the boat . 
Some 840 migrants have boarded the boat , and more were being placed on board , the IOM said . 
The vessel , which had brought 180 tons of humanitarian aid to Misrata , was expected to depart in the afternoon . 
As the bloody battles in the North African country dragged into their fourth month , a U.N. official said the Libyan government and opposition members were trying to find a way for a cease-fire . 
Abdul Ilah al-Khatib , the U.N. 's special envoy to Libya , said both sides had told him that they were ready for a cease-fire . 
The only problem was that they disagreed on what conditions would be needed to lay down arms , the envoy said . 
The Libyan government wants an end to NATO aerial attacks ; the opposition wants Gadhafi to step down and will not negotiate with him or any of his family members , al-Khatib said . 
`` A real and credible cease-fire must be agreed upon to suspend aggressive actions and killing of innocent civilians , including women and children , '' al-Khatib told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday . 
`` A cease-fire must be declared either formally , or -- in a first step -- as part of an informal understanding between the opposing forces in Libya . '' 
NATO began bombing Libya on March 19 , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary , short of invasion , to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
This weekend , Libyan authorities said one of Gadhafi 's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed by a NATO airstrike . 
This prompted an increase in pro-Gadhafi forces ' attacks in rebel-held cities and also in the beleaguered western port city of Misrata , witnesses said . 
An explosion rocked Benghazi Tuesday , the eastern city that is controlled by rebel fighters . 
The blast damaged several cars in Benghazi 's main square and a rebel spokesman blamed it on Gadhafi supporters who were somehow able to infiltrate the rebel-held city . 
CNN could not independently confirm that report . 
The continued fighting has sent people fleeing . 
More than 8,000 people -- most of them women and children -- fled into Tunisia over the weekend to escape the fighting between Libyan government troops and opposition forces , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday Nearly 40,000 Libyans have fled the country 's western mountainous region in the past month as pro-Gadhafi and opposition forces have fought for control of the border crossing point , according to the U.N. CNN 's Mitra Mobasherat and Atika Shubert contributed to this report .

2011-05-04,"UNITED NATIONS | Wed May 4 , 2011 4:54 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The International Criminal Court prosecutor said on Wednesday he will request arrest warrants for the killing of pro-democracy demonstrators in Libya , and U.N. envoys said one target could be Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
At the same time , Russian and South African U.N. envoys sharply criticized the NATO-led operations to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly zone , and suggested the ICC should not limit its investigation to Gaddafi 's government . 
ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo , addressing the U.N. Security Council , said he will request three arrest warrants within weeks for alleged crimes against humanity in Libya . 
Moreno-Ocampo is investigating Gaddafi , some of his sons and aides over what he called a `` predetermined plan '' to attack protesters , after the U.N. Security Council referred the Libyan violence to the ICC in February . 
`` Crimes against humanity have been and continue to be committed in Libya , attacking unarmed civilians -- including killings and persecutions in many cities across Libya , '' Moreno-Ocampo said in a statement . 
He urged states to be ready to make arrests should an ICC judges issue the warrants , stressing `` now is the time to start planning on how to implement possible arrest warrants . '' 
Moreno-Ocampo gave no details on whose arrest he would seek . 
But several U.N. diplomats and independent human rights experts said Moreno-Ocampo , whose probe of alleged genocide in Sudan 's Darfur region led to the indictment of Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir , might want Gaddafi 's arrest . 
`` We believe it is possible that Gaddafi could be included among the requested arrest warrants , '' said a spokeswoman in The Hague for the International Federation of Human Rights . 
Moreno-Ocampo said his request for warrants would be based on `` strong evidence , '' which he said would include photographs , video footage and the testimony of government insiders . 
The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to enforce arrests . 
Despite NATO bombing operations intended to protect civilians , Libya has been plunged into civil war , seriously complicating efforts to arrest ICC suspects . 
Libya is not an ICC member state and is therefore not obligated to arrest the court 's suspects . 
Security Council powers the United States , Russia and China are not ICC members either , but voted in favor of referring Libya to the ICC . 
The issue of enforcing ICC warrants is expected to come up at a meeting of a broad coalition of nations aligned against Gaddafi in Rome on Thursday , U.N. envoys told Reuters . 
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin criticized the NATO-led airstrikes and urged members of the coalition to adhere strictly to Security Council resolution 1973 , which authorized `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . 
Churkin said Moscow was `` deeply alarmed '' by the growing number of civilian casualties in Libya . 
He referred to the recent bombings in Tripoli , one of which killed Gaddafi 's son . 
`` Going beyond the mandate of 1973 in any way , and any disproportionate use of force , is unacceptable , '' he said . 
South African Deputy Ambassador Doctor Mashabane suggested NATO should not be immune from an ICC investigation . 
`` It is our sincere hope in considering the evidence , the office of the prosecutor will consider any actions that may have been committed in the purported implementation of resolution 1973 , '' he told the council . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
The US , China and Russia are not members of the ICC and do not recognize its authority but voted to refer the matter to the ICC and ignore the Coalition 's targeting for assassination children in their homes . 
How can a non-member have the right to vote ? 
The Coalition used to be amusing but now are downright Pathetic Thugs . 
Many more will die from this so-called Bungled humanitarian intervention into the affairs of a sovereign nation for oil than if they had just declared a war or stayed out . 
These Leaders do nothing but make a mockery of the UN and Peace . 
This action , makes a mockery of the ICC , which I suspect , is the intention in the first place . 
Here we have the U.S. Administration ` ordering ' it 's military to committ extrajudicial murder from the air , infringing on another nations soveriegnity and murdering innocent men , women and children , destroying infrastructure of nations which have not lifted a finger against the U.S. yet not ONE official within the U.S. Administration , past or present , has ever been charged by the I.C.C. for the whole sale murder and mayhem that the U.S. unleashes on innocent people on a daily basis . 
Even the murder of OBL , which was against ever law ever written , and the I.C.C. utters not a word . 
So who is it really , who is behind these charges emanting from the I.C.C. ? 
It would seem , they pick their targets who invariably are always a thorn in the side of the U.S. Administration . 
One could easily , therefore conclude , the I.C.C. is nothing but another tool of the N.W.O. doing the U.S. 's bidding , thus can not be relied upon as authentic body .

2011-05-04,"KHARTOUM | Wed May 4 , 2011 7:39 pm EDT KHARTOUM -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Sudan has deployed troops at the Libyan border to prevent arms smuggling to rebels in Darfur and closed the Libyan consulate in the troubled region , a government official said Wednesday . 
Sudan shares an almost 400-km-long -LRB- 240-mile -RRB- border with Libya where a civil war against leader Muammar Gaddafi has split the desert state into a government-held western area around the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by rebels . 
`` We deployed troops at the border to Libya because we are worried about arms smuggling -LRB- to rebels -RRB- , '' Khalid Musa , spokesman for the Sudanese foreign ministry , said . 
Sudan closed the Libyan consulate in al-Fasher in Darfur and asked staff to leave within 48 hours after Libya had closed the Sudanese consulate in the eastern town of al-Kufrah , Musa said . 
`` We summoned the Libyan ambassador for an explanation why the consulate was closed but his answer came too late and was not satisfactory so we closed the Libyan consulate , '' he said . 
There is little love lost between Gaddafi and Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir , who was indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide and other war crimes in Darfur . 
Relations were strained between Libya and Sudan after Gaddafi agreed to offer refuge to Darfur rebel Justice and Equality Movement chief Khalil Ibrahim , who had left peace talks in Qatar to return to fighting in Darfur . 
Last year , Libya promised to curb any Darfur rebel attacks . 
Gaddafi hosted and helped insurgents early in the Darfur conflict , which began in 2003 when mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms , accusing Khartoum of neglect . 
Sudan 's counterinsurgency campaign drove more than 2 million Darfuris from their homes , sparking one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises that the United Nations estimates has killed as many as 300,000 people .

2011-05-05,"By the CNN Wire Staff Hillary Clinton in Rome : `` As long as Gadhafi continues to attack his citizens , we will continue to strike his forces . '' 
NEW : Libyan government says use of its assets would be theft Rebels claim they have retaken southern city The U.S. considers seizing Gadhafi funds to help Libya 's people The International Organization for Migration suspends ships after Misrata is shelled Rome -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , meeting with allies , kept up pressure on Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Thursday , demanding that he `` cease attacks and the threat of attacks '' against rebels who oppose his rule . 
Gadhafi must withdraw all forces from rebel cities they have entered , restore services to those cities , and allow humanitarian aid in , Clinton insisted . 
U.S. and NATO bombing of his forces will continue until he meets the terms , she said . 
`` As long as Gadhafi continues to attack his citizens , we will continue to strike his forces , '' she said . 
`` It is time for the violence to end . 
It is time for Gadhafi to go . 
It is time for a democratic transition to begin , '' she said . 
The United States is also looking into ways to help the rebels financially , including seizing Gadhafi assets and using them to aid Libya 's people , and helping the Transitional National Council to sell oil , Clinton said . 
Clinton was speaking in Rome , where international powers held their second high-level meeting on the Libyan crisis . 
The Libyan government , according to state TV , said financing the rebels from frozen assets would be equivalent to theft . 
Congress is being consulted on the possible use of a portion of the $ 30 billion in assets , two senior State Department officials said . 
It was not clear whether any of the money would go directly to the opposition government . 
European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton said the Rome meeting `` underlined the international community 's unity and determination to bring the Libyan crisis to a quick and satisfactory conclusion . 
With the humanitarian situation deteriorating , time is of the essence . 
Gadhafi must end his attacks against his own people and respect human rights . '' 
Also Thursday , the International Organization for Migration said it was suspending its passenger ships between the two rebel towns of Benghazi and Misrata after Gadhafi forces shelled the port in Misrata Wednesday , killing at least five people . 
IOM media director Jean Philippe Chauzy said operations would be suspended until the organization puts in place a `` better evacuation plan . '' 
The IOM never again wants to experience what happened on Wednesday , he said . 
No one was injured on the IOM-chartered boat in Misrata at the time of the shelling , the agency said . 
Medecins Sans Frontieres , the international medical humanitarian group -LRB- known as Doctors Without Borders in English -RRB- , said a 22-member team is delivering surgical and medical care to the wounded at two hospitals and a clinic . 
The organization has donated more than 25 tons of medicine and medical equipment , it said in a statement Thursday . 
Rebels , meanwhile , told CNN that they have taken the southern city of al-Koufra , with Gadhafi forces gone except for a small group on its western edge . 
The two sides have exchanged control over al-Koufra over the past two months . 
CNN could not independently verify the claim . 
Meanwhile , British Foreign Secretary William Hague ordered two Libyan diplomats to leave the country for `` actions contrary to the interests of the UK , '' the Foreign Office announced Thursday . 
He gave them a week to get out , starting Wednesday , the Foreign Office statement said . 
The British Ministry of Defense and NATO said Thursday their forces had been engaging Gadhafi 's troops over the past several days , destroying ammunition dumps , surface-to-air batteries , and other targets . 
As for the Rome meeting , Hague said the international community is `` resolved to continue to take action '' on Libya , and `` more countries took part and reiterated that Gadhafi should go . '' 
Participants also agreed to help the Transitional National Council with short term financial support with the establishment of the Temporary Financial Mechanism , which was suggested in the first meeting in Doha , Qatar , according to a statement released at the conclusion of the talks . 
The diplomatic and military moves came soon after the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court said in a report there are `` reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed and continue being committed in Libya . '' 
The report highlighted the alleged commission of rape by Gadhafi 's government , as well as the deportation or forcible transfer of citizens during the civil war that continues to rage in that country . 
It also noted war crimes , including intentionally directing attacks against civilians not participating in the fighting . 
ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo issued a statement saying he will soon request arrest warrants against three individuals who are `` most responsible for the crimes committed . '' 
The individuals were not named . 
It is not clear if he plans to file charges against anyone on the rebel side , though the report mentioned `` alleged war crimes as well as other crimes against humanity '' appear to have been committed by `` different parties . '' 
He warned when he opened the probe two months ago that the rebels are subject to international law just as Gadhafi 's forces are . 
This is the first time the International Criminal Court has begun investigating possible crimes against humanity as they were occurring in wartime , Moreno-Ocampo said . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , on a visit to Bulgaria , said , `` I fully support the principle that whoever and whenever there is violation of human rights and international humanitarian law , those people should be accountable and go to justice . '' 
NATO began bombing Libya on March 19 , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary , short of invasion , to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
CNN 's Elise Labott , Amir Ahmed , Carol Jordan , Mitra Mobasherat and Atika Shubert contributed to this report .

2011-05-05,"TRIPOLI | Thu May 5 , 2011 12:42 am BST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - An aid ship defied deadly shell fire to rescue African and Asian migrant workers from the besieged port of Misrata Wednesday , but was forced to leave behind hundreds of Libyans desperate to flee the fighting . 
Aid workers had earlier scrambled to embark the migrants , along with journalists and the wounded , on the ship bound for rebel-held Benghazi as the Misrata port came under bombardment from forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi . 
`` The bombing has caused so many casualties among Libyans and people of other nationalities waiting for evacuation , '' Gemal Salem , a rebel spokesman , told Reuters . 
`` So far we have five killed and ambulances are rushing to the scene . '' 
The Red Star One , sent by the International Organisation for Migration , picked up 800 people caught up in the civil war who had been waiting for days to escape Misrata 's worsening humanitarian crisis . 
It had hoped to take 1,000 people . 
`` Hundreds of Libyan civilians had also tried to board the ship in desperation to get out of Misrata . 
But with a limited capacity , the ramp of the boat had to be pulled up so that the ship could pull away from the dock in safety , '' the IOM said . 
The shelling was also hitting Misrata 's Qasr Ahmad district , a mixed residential and industrial area which houses the iron and steel works in a city that has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the two-month conflict . 
Another rebel spokesman , Abdelsalem , said the five killed were African migrant workers . 
He said fighting was continuing in the southern neighborhood of al-Ghiran , where rebels say pro-Gaddafi forces have been trying to advance on the city center , and in Zawiyat al-Mahjoub to the west . 
The port is a lifeline for Misrata , where food and medical supplies are low and snipers shoot from rooftops . 
Other rescue ships are offshore but there was no news of their movements . 
About 12,000 people have so far been rescued by 12 ships . 
Minesweepers from the NATO coalition , whose aircraft have been bombing Libyan government military targets under a United Nations resolution , had been searching the approaches to the harbor since Monday for a drifting Gaddafi forces ' mine . 
The United States Wednesday condemned the continued shelling of Misrata and called on Gaddafi 's forces to permit the IOM to resume evacuating wounded people from the port . 
The civil war over Gaddafi 's 41-year rule has split the oil-producing desert state into a government-held western area round the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by ill-disciplined but dedicated rebel forces . 
The insurgents had hoped for a swift overthrow of Gaddafi . 
But his better-trained and better-equipped forces halted the westward rebel advance from their stronghold of Benghazi and a standoff in the fighting has prevailed since then . 
The United States , Britain and France , leading a NATO air campaign , say they will not stop until Gaddafi is toppled . 
International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said he would request three arrest warrants for his investigation into the killing of pro-democracy demonstrators . 
`` Crimes against humanity have been and continue to be committed in Libya , attacking unarmed civilians including killings and persecutions in many cities across Libya . '' 
At a U.N. Security Council meeting , Russia criticised the NATO campaign , saying it was using disproportionate force , and South Africa said the international court should also scrutinise the Western alliance for potential war crimes . 
NATO officers met Wednesday in Brussels to review their operation 's progress , rejecting assessments of stalemate on the battlefield despite their warplanes ' intervention , as nations prepared for a meeting in Rome Thursday over rebel finances . 
NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the meeting a `` reaffirmation of the strong commitment to our operation , '' adding that he sensed no fatigue among the allies , while Gaddafi 's forces were weaker than when the NATO campaign began . 
Gaddafi , who seized power in a 1969 coup , has not been seen in public since a NATO missile attack Saturday on a house in Tripoli , which Libyan officials said killed his youngest son and three grandchildren . 
Officials said he was in good health . '' 
-LRB- The -RRB- best intelligence we have is that he -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- is still alive , '' CIA Director Leon Panetta told NBC News . 
Libyan state television said Wednesday that NATO forces bombed Al-Hayrah , west of the capital , causing casualties . 
`` The colonialist , crusader alliance has just bombed Al-Hayrah a short while ago , causing human casualties and damage to infrastructure , '' the broadcaster said . 
Libya 's army also fired volleys of rockets at the rebel-held town of Zintan in the Western Mountains , pressing on with a campaign that has forced thousands to flee the country . 
Rebels said more than 40 Grad rockets hit Zintan late Tuesday . 
The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said an exodus from the Western Mountains region had resumed , with Libyan families fleeing into southern Tunisia . 
`` This past weekend , more than 8,000 people , most of them ethnic Berbers , arrived in Dehiba in southern Tunisia . 
Most are women and children , '' UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told a news briefing in Geneva . 
Tens of thousands have already fled . 
While a few rebel pockets such as Zintan and Misrata resist Gaddafi 's forces in western Libya , in the largely rebel-held east the most pressing need is for cash . 
Rebels say they expect up to three billion dollars in credit soon from Western governments to feed and supply their territories in the east . 
With Libya 's economy in turmoil , funds to pay for food , medicine and the state salaries on which most people depend are running low . 
Securing financing for rebels and facilitating contacts with defectors will be the focus of Libya talks in Rome Thursday , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said . 
Juppe told France 24 television the meeting of the so-called `` Contact Group '' on Libya , including Western and Middle Eastern countries , the United Nations , the African Union and the Arab League , would discuss setting up a financing mechanism . 
`` It 's not easy . 
There are Libyan assets that are frozen and for legal reasons unfreezing them is difficult , '' Juppe said . 
Juppe said another aim of the Rome meeting would be to build contacts with defectors from Gaddafi 's government and officials who want to leave it . 
`` There are a lot of officials from Tripoli who want to talk . 
We are going to try to coordinate , '' he said . 
The revolt in Libya is the bloodiest yet against long-entrenched rulers across the Middle East and North Africa . 
The Arab Spring has seen the overthrow of the veteran presidents of Tunisia and Egypt -- Libya 's western and eastern neighbors .

2011-05-06,"Rebels in Benghazi training inside a military camp that was occupied by Gadhafi forces Most of the weapons are twice as old as the young Libyan rebels using them But rebel leaders say they are able to train their fighters longer and better now Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wide-eyed youth watch as their commanders give step-by-step instruction on how to handle weapons -- most of the arms are twice as old as the young men who will use them . 
It does n't matter to these volunteer fighters . 
They are itching to learn so they can head to the front line . 
University student Faisal Faraj had never used a gun before showing up at a rebel training camp in Benghazi . 
But after what he witnessed on the streets of this opposition stronghold in eastern Libya , he decided to learn the art of war instead of studying science . 
`` In the beginning we went out protesting peacefully carrying banners , demanding more freedom . 
They -LRB- the Gadhafi forces -RRB- responded with bullets and they were attacking us in a ruthless way using heavy weaponry , tanks and planes . 
So we got fed up . '' 
Ironically the anti-government forces are training inside a military camp that was occupied by Gadhafi forces until a couple of months ago . 
Government troops tried to destroy the place when Benghazi fell to the rebels . 
The assistant commander of the rebel 's 17th of February Martyrs Brigade said the local people used to be terrified of this camp . 
Libya humanitarian mission turns chaotic `` This camp was the Revolutionary Committees camp . 
They were the most brutal arm of Gadhafi forces . 
People were being tortured here , they were being imprisoned here , '' said Mustafa Saguzli . 
Now the rebels hoping to topple the Gadhafi regime are using the burned out grounds . 
More than two months since the uprising began , rebel leaders say they are able to train their fighters longer and better now . 
`` When the war started it was almost like a picnic . 
Anybody who wants to fight can go by himself , carry an arm and go by himself , '' said Saguzli . 
`` In the very beginning we had short courses of two weeks because the battle was moving so fast and we needed to have as many fighters as possible . 
Now it is taking one month to a month and a half . '' 
Saguzli has no military experience . 
He is a computer engineer who owned a business . 
Now he 's using his programming skills to program young minds for victory in the battlefield . 
The fighters are even specializing . 
There is a section of the camp dedicated to refurbishing weapons -- a skill that is turning out to be as vital as the ability to use the weapons . 
The yard is filled with broken down arms , most of which are from the 1940s . 
They clink away on the bits and pieces they have and then test the weapons . 
They often do n't work the first time around and the process starts all over again . 
Every now and then the tired spoils of war show up at the camp via a flat-bed truck . 
This time it 's armed jeeps that the commanders say were captured from Gadhafi 's troops in Ajadabiya . 
They are all in poor shape and must be repaired . 
The rebels say they have received a few new arms from the Gulf state of Qatar but have long been calling for NATO to give more . 
`` Libya could be your gate to a new way of dealing with the Muslim world , '' said Saguzli . 
`` I have to be honest with you when the west supported Mubarak or Gadhafi or Assad -LRB- the long time heads of state of Egypt , Libya , and Syria -RRB- or any of these tyrants who were killing us , the west was our enemy . 
`` And now the west , America and Europe is supporting us . 
Now they are our allies and friends . '' 
Volunteers keep showing up at the camp to go through the most basic training regime you can imagine . 
They are using still bars , rope , and the few guns they have to get the recruits ready to fight as best they can . 
61-year-old Fendi Faraj came out of retirement from the military to help the recruits with their fight against the very forces he used to serve . 
`` What I witnessed , as far as the army attacking the people , can not allow an honest soldier to remain in the service . '' 
Faraj has vowed to teach the young to fight against the regime knowing first hand there is a massive imbalance in training and weaponry . 
`` There is no comparison , '' he said . 
`` It 's like the difference between the sky and the earth . 
But the youth want to live free and if they die , they want to die a martyr . '' 
It is a choice these volunteers make willingly . 
Some have even warned their commanders if they do n't get arms soon they will go to the front lines without them .

2011-05-06,"MOSCOW | Fri May 6 , 2011 10:07 am EDT MOSCOW -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Russia on Friday criticized a Western-led grouping that has pledged aid to the Libyan rebels fighting Muammar Gaddafi 's forces , warning that it must not seek to usurp the authority of the U.N. Security Council . 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi said the two nations -- both permanent Security Council members with veto power -- would work together to seek stability in the Middle East and North African region . 
Russia and China , which abstained in the Security Council vote that authorized military intervention in Libya to protect civilians , have criticized the Western-led coalition conducting air strikes . 
Russia has accused it of overstepping its mandate . 
After talks with Yang in Moscow , Lavrov criticized the Libya contact group of Western and Arab countries that agreed on Thursday to provide Libya 's eastern rebels , based in Benghazi , with millions of dollars in non-military aid to help them keep services and the economy running . 
The contact group includes the other three veto-wielding permanent U.N. Security Council members -- the United States , Britain and France -- as well as Italy , Qatar , Kuwait and Jordan . 
The contact group `` is increasing its efforts to take on the leading role in determining the policy of the international community in relation to Libya , '' Lavrov told a news conference . 
`` We proceed from the position that the informal contact group comprises responsible states and that all of them ratified the U.N. Charter and are required to respect the authority of the Security Council . '' 
Lavrov said the conflict in Libya was a civil war and the international community should focus on stopping the fighting and not `` taking sides . '' 
Russia and China `` will coordinate our actions to foster the swiftest possible stabilization '' in the Arab world , he said . 
Yang , who also met President Dmitry Medvedev , said the `` sovereignty , independence and unity of Libya must be respected . 
People of all countries of the world ... have the right to choose their path of development . '' 
He reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire in order to prevent `` a great humanitarian catastrophe in Libya . '' 
Lavrov made clear that if asked , Moscow would not approve an international ground operation in Libya . 
The Security Council resolution that authorized military intervention in Libya `` directly and unequivocally rules out '' ground operations , Lavrov said , when asked whether the council might authorize such intervention . 
`` The position of the Russian Federation remains absolutely unchanged , '' he said .

A fire-fighter attempts to put out a blaze at fuel storage tanks in Misrata in this still image taken from video uploaded on a social media website May 6 , 2011 . 
REUTERS\/Social Media Website via Reuters TV TRIPOLI | Sat May 7 , 2011 7:30 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan government forces destroyed four fuel storage tanks and set several others ablaze in rebel-held Misrata , dealing a blow to the port city 's ability to withstand a government siege , rebels said on Saturday . 
The bombardment of the western city came as artillery rounds fired by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fell in Tunisia in an escalation of fighting near the border with rebels trying to end Gaddafi 's rule of more than four decades . 
Misrata , the last remaining city in the west under rebel control , has been under siege for more than two months and has witnessed some of the war 's fiercest fighting . 
Rebels gave varying accounts of the bombardment but said the attack hit fuel used for export as well as domestic consumption . 
`` Four -LRB- fuel -RRB- tanks were totally destroyed and a huge fire erupted which spread now to the other four . 
We can not extinguish it because we do not have the right tools , '' rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan told Reuters . 
`` Now the city will face a major problem . 
Those were the only sources of fuel for the city . 
These tanks could have kept the city for three months with enough fuel , '' he said by telephone . 
Video of the incident posted on YouTube by Libyan students in Misrata showed firefighters turning water hoses on a raging fire in a vain attempt to extinguish it . 
Hassan said rebels notified NATO about the planes before the attack but there had been no response . 
Government forces last month flew at least one helicopter reconnaissance mission over Misrata , according to rebels . 
NATO coalition aircraft have been bombing Libyan government military targets and enforcing a no-fly zone under a U.N. resolution . 
Western and Arab countries this week agreed to provide rebels with millions of dollars in non-military aid to help them keep services and the economy running . 
Rebels have long been demanding they also need more heavy weapons to take on the Libyan leader 's better-armed and trained forces . 
On Saturday , the rebels said they had reached an agreement with Italy to supply them with weapons , but the former colonial power denied the report . 
Abdel-Hafiz Ghoga , spokesman for the rebel Transitional National Council , told journalists at a news conference in Benghazi that the weapons would be supplied to the rebels soon . 
In Rome , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said no such agreement had been reached . 
`` There has been no agreement to supply them with weapons , '' the spokesman told Reuters . 
Italy has thrown its full support behind the rebels , formally recognizing the transitional council as the only legitimate representatives of the country , but it is unlikely it would go further than other countries in the anti-Gaddafi coalition . 
Fighting has intensified in Libya 's Western Mountains region as Gaddafi loyalists and rebels , backed by NATO bombing , reached stalemate on other fronts in the civil war . 
Government forces surrounding the rebel-held Zintan fired 300 rockets into the town on Saturday , rebel spokesman Abdulrahman al-Zintani said . 
He gave no details of casualties in Zintan , which is largely empty of civilians . 
`` NATO aircraft can be heard but there have been no air strikes , '' al-Zintani told Reuters . 
The Tunisian town of Dehiba has been hit repeatedly by stray shells in recent weeks , and on Saturday Tunisia condemned the `` extremely dangerous '' shelling and said it would take all necessary measures to protect its sovereignty . 
The Libyan government denied it targeted Tunisian soil deliberately . 
`` We said this -LRB- shelling -RRB- was an error and we have apologized that this took place and have asked the military forces to ensure this does n't happen again , '' Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi told a news conference in Tripoli . 
The battle is for control of the Dehiba-Wazzin border crossing , which gives the rebels a road from the outside world into strongholds in the Western Mountains region . 
Although the rebels hold the border point , Gaddafi 's forces are in charge of a far bigger one to the north . 
On Saturday Dehiba 's schools were evacuated and residents scurried for safety as close to 100 mortars and missiles fell . 
The crackle of small arms fire as well as larger weapons could also be heard about 4 km -LRB- 2.5 miles -RRB- inside Libya , a Reuters witness on the border said . 
`` We are very afraid . 
The missiles are falling right around us , we do n't know what to do , '' said Tunisian Mohammed Naguez , a resident of Dehiba . 
`` Our children are afraid . 
The Tunisian authorities have to stop this . '' 
Most of the people in the Western Mountains belong to the Berber ethnic group and are distinct from other Libyans . 
They rose up two months ago and say towns such as Zintan and Yafran are under repeated bombardment from Gaddafi 's forces , running short of food , water and medicine . 
The civil war over Gaddafi 's rule has split the oil-producing desert state into a government-held western area round the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by ill-disciplined but dedicated rebel forces . 
The revolt is the bloodiest yet against long-entrenched rulers across the Middle East and North Africa , which saw the overthrow of the veteran presidents of Tunisia and Egypt .

When the US supported the rebels they were moving forward -- now with NATO they seem to be getting less and less help as well as moving BACKWARDS . 
What 's up with NATO -- WAKE UP WAKE UP NATO -- the US provided help and you are asleep !!! Truth is coming to light . 
UN intervention in Libya , led by Obama and clinton , france , italy and the uk was wrong . 
There was no attempt tp commit `` crimes against humanity '' on the libya citizens , , before or after the UN intervention . 
We see in the latest attempt to prolong this intervention ; the us led contact group in italy , was set up tpo aid the rebels with arms and training , admitted to by the italian foreign minister and alluded to by the rebel spokesman in this news release . 
Time to leave the civil war to the Libyans . 
Whatever the reason for intervention = is not the concern of the U.S. . 
The security council of the UN was wrong for causing resolutions 1970 and 1973 and the international criminal court should zero in the irresponsible and illegal bombings and other like offensive actions by the nato coalition that corrupted the no fly zone rule .

At least three rounds of explosions echoed across the Libyan capital in a three-hour span that began late Monday , and the roar of jets could be heard overhead . 
Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told CNN that the warplanes hit administrative buildings in central Tripoli , and that a nearby hospital was `` indirectly '' affected . 
`` Tonight was an exceptional night in Tripoli , '' Ibrahim said , noting that the strikes followed `` an extended period of calm . '' 
`` It is very sad , '' he said . 
`` We are losing people every day on both sides . 
We think it is time to sit down and talk . '' 
NATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi 's forces and government installations since March 31 as Gadhafi attempts to put down a nearly three-month-old revolt against his rule . 
Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN on Monday that Gadhafi and his regime `` have no future , '' but refused to predict how long the Libyan leader could hold on . 
Rasmussen denied that the situation in Libya had devolved into a `` stalemate , '' insisting that NATO was `` making progress '' and had `` taken out '' a substantial part of Gadhafi 's military capability . 
He said a political solution was required to bring the conflict to an end , but `` It 's hard to imagine an end to the violence as long as Gadhafi remains in power . '' 
Despite the ongoing bombardment , Gadhafi 's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in the port city of Misrata , survivors there have told CNN . 
Misrata is the only city in western Libya held by the rebels , and witnesses say indiscriminate shelling has left victims with crushed bones , burns and amputations . 
`` They are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods . 
It has become an operation of revenge , not just taking over the city of Misrata , '' said Ibrahim al-Neairy , a rebel who was injured in the fighting and evacuated to Benghazi . 
Alleged rape victim flees Libya She fled Gadhafi , wants to see family It has become an operation of revenge , not just taking over the city of Misrata -- Ibrahim al-Neairy , wounded rebel Mostafa Bozen , a spokesman for the rebels , said fighters attacked Gadhafi 's forces about 22 kilometers -LRB- 14 miles -RRB- from Tripoli , killing 12 and hitting a tank . 
The situation in Misrata `` is at the forefront '' of U.N. concerns about Libya 's civilian population , Valerie Amos , the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs , told the Security Council on Monday . 
Two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the city 's port has prevented aid ships from docking there , and between 150 and 300 non-Libyans are still waiting to be evacuated , she said . 
`` Some people are running short of food , water and other basics , '' she said . 
`` Medical facilities need supplies and more trained personnel . '' 
The Security Council voted in March to authorize the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi 's regime . 
Nearly 750,000 people have fled the country , another 58,000 are displaced within Libya and another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings into Libya , Tunisia and Niger , Amos said . 
For those who remain , Amos said the fighting and the sanctions imposed on Gadhafi and his allies have caused `` a severe disruption of supply lines within the country . '' 
The results have been `` shortages of fuel , difficulties in obtaining commodities including foodstuffs , medicines and other essential goods , and there have been severe cash shortages throughout the country . '' 
Western Libya has about three months ' supply of food remaining ; the mostly rebel-held east has about two months , she said . 
Fuel and supplies for desalinization plants and other facilities that provide fresh water to many Libyans `` are running out , '' she added . 
There have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time . 
As time wears on , though , human rights groups have expressed growing concern for besieged Libyans in Misrata . 
The wounded arriving in Benghazi , the rebel hub city , painted a gruesome picture of the fighting in Misrata . 
Hanan Muhammad , who was evacuated along with about 800 others on an aid ship charted by the International Organization for Migration , was wounded when a missile struck near her home . 
`` I was in my house praying when the first missile landed . 
Shortly after , more missiles , one after another started hitting our neighborhood , '' said Muhammad , who suffered a broken arm and shrapnel wounds . 
People are scared every moment of the day no matter their age , '' she said . 
`` Oh God , it 's like a horror movie . '' 
Al-Neairy , who suffered facial burns and shrapnel wounds , said he does not regret fighting . 
`` The price for freedom is high and it -LRB- is -RRB- necessary to be liberated from this regime , '' he said . 
Amnesty International has said Gadhafi 's attacks in the port city may amount to war crimes . 
A report issued last week by the monitoring group accused pro-Gadhafi forces of the `` unlawful killing of civilians due to indiscriminate attacks , including use of heavy artillery , rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents . '' 
`` I 'm not going to guess about a timeline . 
I want a solution sooner rather than later , '' Rasmussen said .

2011-05-09,"Wounded evacuees from Misrata tell of attacks on civilians and rebel fighters Witnesses describe a living hell hiding in cellars as missiles rain down Their statements could be evidence war crimes are being committed They left Misrata on an aid ship with about 800 evacuees on board Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Inside the Intensive Care Unit at Benghazi Medical Center the injuries to the patients are horrendous . 
One patient has suffered a paralyzing bullet to the head , another is missing a left leg , has a broken right leg and is on a respirator , yet another has burns to his face and is barely conscious . 
The maimed men are the latest arrivals in the Libyan rebel stronghold from the besieged city of Misrata -- the center of the most ferocious fighting between Colonel Moammar Gadhafi 's forces and fighters trying to oust his government . 
More than 800 people managed to get out of the city on the latest aid ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration . 
Some were migrant workers , others extremely sick or wounded people who had no chance of survival if they stayed put . 
`` The ship was attempting to dock for two day but they could not . 
One day they were finally able to get in to get us . 
Some rushed to the ship but the rest of the wounded could not because the shelling was non-stop , '' Ibrahim Al-Neairy said . 
Al-Neairy had taken up arms against Gadhafi forces when he was injured . 
His face is scarred from blast burns , his body is embedded with shrapnel , and his head is filled with images of dead friends lost in battle . 
But he is alive and angry at what is happening to people in the city . 
`` They are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods . 
It has become an operation for revenge , not just taking over the city of Misrata , '' Al-Neairy said . 
It is n't just fighters from the front line who are occupying the hospital beds . 
Just down the hall in the women 's ward , patient Hana Mohammad sits with her arm all bandaged up a victim of shelling . 
She has shrapnel wounds all over her body . 
`` I was in my house praying when the first missile landed . 
Shortly after , more missiles , one after another , started hitting our neighborhood and its houses . 
About 10 missiles landed , one every five minutes , '' she said . 
One of those missiles hit her home where she was huddled with several members of her extended family . 
Three relatives did not make it out alive . 
She and her husband survived and saw the remains of their city as they made their way to the ship to Benghazi . 
`` People are scared every moment of the day no matter their age : children , young , old , and women -- everyone . 
It is like a horror movie . 
Oh God it is like a horror movie , '' she said . 
Several patients said the shelling was coming from outside the city where rebels had pushed Gadhafi 's troops . 
If what the patients are describing is accurate , it could be evidence war crimes are being committed . 
The international criminal court says it has grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been -- and continue to be -- committed in Libya . 
Those rescued say the journey down the Mediterranean coast took 16 hours and the shelling never seemed to end . 
According to witnesses the city is in ruins . 
`` There was blood and destruction everywhere . 
I saw death before me . 
Everything was horrible , '' Hanan Mohamad said . 
She said most residents could n't go out safely , not even for food . 
Instead groups of young men have formed to pick up rations from aid organizations and distribute them to homes . 
While Misrata 's injured endure physical pain , one patient sits on her bed along crying tears of shame and regret . 
`` I want to go back . 
I wish I had n't left , '' 25-year-old Najah said . 
She was taken to port by ambulance and needs surgery from a complication to her pregnancy . 
She 's still having trouble coming to terms with what she went through . 
Amid the death and destruction , Najah had to leave her three young daughters behind ; ages five , three , and five months . 
`` It is as if I left my heart back in Misrata . '' 
If the stories the wounded and sick survivors are telling is any indication of what people continue to endure there , Misrata has become a living hell .

2011-05-11,"By the CNN Wire Staff Gadhafi makes first appearance in weeks Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi was last seen on video April 30 A Libyan government spokesman says Gadhafi is alive and well Some wonder if he was killed in a NATO airstrike Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Renewed bombing could be heard Thursday morning in Tripoli shortly after NATO jets were heard flying over the city . 
The explosions came a few hours after Libyan state television broadcast video late Wednesday that it said showed Col. Moammar Gadhafi meeting earlier in the day with tribal elders in a hotel in the capital -- marking the Libyan leader 's first public appearance in nearly two weeks . 
`` The leader met with tribal elders in Tripoli a few hours ago , and this proves the perseverance and permanence of the Libyan nation and its leader , '' the announcer said . 
`` God willing , they are victorious . '' 
The camera panned from a television program bearing the date May 11 to the group of more than a dozen men , including Gadhafi . 
The TV appearance was the first for Gadhafi -- who was wearing sunglasses and dressed in dark clothing -- since April 30 , the same day a NATO airstrike hit the Tripoli compound reportedly housing him and one of his sons . 
Libyan officials said at the time that Saif al-Arab Gadhafi was killed , but his father had escaped . 
Libyan television ran a banner that said he was meeting with tribal elders . 
The camera showed a seated Gadhafi speaking to the men , who were also seated . 
Wednesday 's appearance took place in the Rixos Hotel , a government official said . 
The hotel houses a number of international journalists , including those working for CNN . 
`` Let me tell you something , dear leader , '' one of the men says . 
`` I swear to God you will surely win . '' 
Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim had said earlier in the day that Gadhafi was `` alive , well and very healthy . '' 
Ibrahim added that Gadhafi had been targeted three times by NATO airstrikes and that government officials were worried about his safety . 
`` We need him to lead , to be safe , '' Ibrahim said . 
Earlier Wednesday , the chief operations officer of NATO 's Operation Unified Protector told reporters in Brussels , Belgium , that the organization had no evidence about what Gadhafi was doing . 
`` And I tell you the truth , we 're not really interested in what he is doing , '' Brig. Gen. Claudio Gabellini said . 
`` Our mandate is to protect civilians from the attacks and from the threat of attacks , so we 're not looking after individuals . '' 
NATO took over the mission to protect Libyan civilians authorized by a United Nations resolution and is using airstrikes to target installations that may be used to facilitate attacks against civilians . 
Gabellini said that NATO is targeting military objectives , not individuals .

2011-05-11,"NEW : Libyan official says four rockets struck Bab al-Aziziya Thursday morning Control of airport would be key to rebels seeking entry point for aid Spokesman says government forces are in control of Misrata 's airport and seaport Misrata has been engulfed in violence for weeks Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four rockets struck the compound belonging to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Thursday , a Libyan government official told CNN . 
After the blasts , which could be heard in the center of Tripoli , sirens blared and at least two emergency vehicles could be seen speeding toward the Bab al-Aziziya compound . 
It was not immediately clear whether anyone was hurt . 
On May 1 , the Libyan government said another attack on the same compound had killed Gadhafi 's son Saif al-Arab Gadhafi and three of the leader 's grandchildren . 
Thursday 's strike came a day after spokesmen for the Libyan rebels sparred with a spokesman for the Libyan government over who was in control of the airport in the besieged city of Misrata . 
During the day , Shamsiddin Abdulmolah of the Transitional National Council said the airport , located in the southern part of the war-torn city , had fallen to `` revolutionaries '' after opposition fighters in nearby Zlaitin were able to join their counterparts in Misrata . 
During the night , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said government forces were in control of the airport and the seaport in Misrata . 
He said rebel forces had been there `` for -LRB- a -RRB- short time , and left . '' 
But a rebel spokesman in Misrata , who has asked to be identified solely as Mohamed , said late Wednesday night that the rebels had retained control of the airport and were also in control of a civil defense base beyond the airport . 
The capture of the airport would be key for rebels fighting the forces of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi since it would provide an important entry point for humanitarian aid . 
Two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the Misrata port have prevented most aid ships from docking there , leaving the city `` at the forefront '' of U.N. humanitarian concerns , a top U.N. official told the Security Council this week . 
NATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi 's forces since March as Gadhafi 's troops try to quash a nearly 3-month-old revolt against his nearly 42 years of rule . 
In Misrata , Abdulmolah said an unknown number of casualties occurred in the fighting . 
He also reported that the oil-rich town of Jakharra , in the interior of the country , fell Tuesday night to opposition forces and that Gadhafi 's forces were surrounded in the oasis towns of Awjila and Jalu . 
The NATO mission is intended to enforce a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for the protection of civilians . 
U.S. President Barack Obama and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen will meet at the White House on Friday to discuss the alliance 's role , the White House said Wednesday . 
NATO said Wednesday that vehicle and ammunition storage facilities , a surface-to-air missile launcher and an anti-aircraft gun had been hit in the Tripoli area . 
It also said in a news release that ambulance storage facilities were struck in Mizdah and Qaryat . 
As for Misrata , Marie Colvin , the Middle East correspondent for Britain 's Sunday Times , told CNN that rebel forces defending the city from government troops were making `` meter-by-meter '' gains despite heavy shelling and rocket attacks . 
Units loyal to Gadhafi have been firing rockets and artillery shells into residential neighborhoods , leaving a nearby emergency room full of women , children and old men , she said . 
`` The rebels are very much trying , at a minimum , to push back Gadhafi 's lines so he simply ca n't do that , '' Colvin said Tuesday . 
As for aid , a ship carrying supplies from the International Committee of the Red Cross docked Tuesday in Misrata , but the ongoing fighting had deterred captains of other ships from trying to enter the port , Colvin said . 
The ICRC said the vessel was carrying medical supplies , spare parts to repair water and electrical supply systems and 8,000 jars of baby food . 
On the front lines of the battle , bullets were whizzing past `` like very angry hornets , '' Colvin said . 
At least 70 rebels have been wounded -- but they have held their line , `` and meter by meter were able to advance , '' she said . 
`` They 're defending their homes . 
They 're defending their families , and they are not giving up an inch . 
They are fighting , '' Colvin said . 
The first shipment of nonlethal aid from the United States to the Libyan opposition arrived Tuesday in Benghazi , U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . 
It included more than 10,000 meals that are permissible under Islamic law . 
Other items en route from the U.S. Defense Department include medical supplies , tents , uniforms , boots and protective gear . 
Almost 750,000 people have fled the country amid the fighting , and another 58,000 are displaced within Libya , Valerie Amos , the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs , told the Security Council Monday . 
Another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings between Libya , Tunisia and Niger , Amos said . 
Others have tried to flee by sea , but one such attempt appears to have ended in disaster for hundreds of refugees as their ship capsized off the capital , Tripoli .

2011-05-11,"By David Lewis DAKAR | Wed May 11 , 2011 7:57 am EDT The fall-out southwards from the civil war in the North African country has so far been mainly limited to waves of returning migrant workers . 
But governments in the Sahel believe fighters of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- have received convoys of weapons including SA-7 missiles looted from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's abandoned arms caches . 
Targeting airliners would take training and moving al Qaeda cells nearer cities , so experts believe any heavy weapons are more likely to be used defensively in case of airborne attacks on the Islamist militants . 
However the remote and often volatile corners of countries such as Mauritania , Mali and Niger , where Islamists operate alongside rebels , local criminals and smugglers , are extremely vulnerable to the spillover effects of Libya 's conflict . 
`` The situation in Libya poses quite some problems for West African countries , '' said Kwesi Aning , a senior official at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center in Ghana . 
`` It is natural that some of the weapons would get into very bad hands ... There is no government control in the northern parts -LRB- of the Sahel fringing Libya -RRB- , '' Aning told Reuters . 
AQIM emerged out of the Algerian Salafist movement in 2007 and , under pressure from the Algerian army to the north , has become increasingly active in the Sahara region . 
The group , believed to number no more than a few hundred , has taken advantage of poor cross-border coordination to mount sporadic attacks on local armies and kidnap Westerners , earning some $ 50-70 million in ransoms so far , analysts say . 
A recent flurry of regional diplomacy has underscored pressing concerns over a spillover from Libya . 
Fears of a reprisal after the killing of Osama bin Laden are also high . 
The leaders of Mali and Chad believe looted weapons have reached AQIM bases in northern Mali , with Chad 's president warning they could become the best-equipped force in the region . 
An Algerian official spoke of several convoys . 
Others say there is no proof yet , though few think it would take much for AQIM , which is plugged into weapons smuggling networks and flush in cash from ransoms , to obtain them . 
`` There are enough floating around that it would be extremely easy for people keen to get hold of them to do so , '' said Peter Bouckaert , emergencies director at Human Rights Watch , who has spent weeks documenting the looted arsenals in Libya . 
Much of the focus has been on missing SA-7 shoulder-launched missiles , used by al Qaeda operatives who tried , but failed , to shoot down an Israeli charter plane in Kenya in 2002 . 
`` It is a top concern because this is one of the favorite weapons of al Qaeda groups , '' Bouckaert said , noting that militants in Iraq showed how stolen weapons could also be turned into bombs . 
Officials are acutely aware of the threat and fears of a `` spectacular '' attack in retaliation for the killing of bin Laden are real , but due to their short range , SA-7s would have to be moved by militants from remote desert bases to near airports by major cities if airliners were to be targeted , experts say . 
`` They are probably more useful as defensive weapons , '' said one diplomat who monitors the group 's activities . 
After mostly opportunistic kidnappings , attacks this year in Niamey and Nouakchott have proven AQIM 's ambition to hit capital cities . 
But another hurdle is the weapon itself , according to Nick Pratt , a terrorism expert at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies . 
`` It is not a weapon you just pick up and shoot ... The big issue is that it takes a long time to train , '' said Pratt , whose military experience included taking part in covert U.S. efforts to arm Mujahideen guerrillas in Afghanistan . 
`` Old Soviet-era -LRB- missiles -RRB- in the Sahara are less of a security concern than a truckload of AK 's -LRB- assault rifles -RRB- . '' 
It may not just be the weapons that flow south either . 
There are widespread reports of Gaddafi recruiting fighters , especially Tuareg nomads , to swell his ranks . 
Some of these new recruits , as well as fighters from the region who had long been in his ranks , will return home one day , officials say . 
Similar flows of experienced fighters back into marginalized parts of Mali and Niger were factors in rebellions during the 1990s . 
These countries ' governments are still struggling to heal wounds after the most recent uprisings between 2007 and 2009 . 
`` There is something of a historical pattern we do n't want to repeat , '' said Andre LeSage , Africa expert at the U.S-based National Defense University . 
Northern Mali , with its grinding poverty and isolation , is particularly susceptible . 
AQIM has turned it into a rear base , integrating into local tribes through marriage and seeking to drive a wedge between the government and local populations . 
Profitable smuggling networks also zigzag through the barren zone , undermining law and order and fuelling corruption . 
Mali President Amadou Toumani Toure last week sought out support among community leaders , warning them of the risks of the flow of weapons and fear of AQIM recruiting new fighters . 
`` We need community leaders to be on good terms with national governments so there is n't popular support for any movement ... so they do n't gain traction , '' LeSage said .

2011-05-12,"Libyans from many countries have returned to fight with rebel forces Bashir , a software developer in Canada , was motivated by news reports to return Fittest are trained to be special forces , other are trained in urban warfare Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Twenty-eight-year-old Bashir says he used to have an idyllic life : A well-paid job as a software developer , good friends and comfortable surroundings in Canada . 
`` I 'm a guy who smokes , listens to rock and roll , and enjoys my life , '' he says . 
Now he 's sleeping in a tent , eating rationed food and learning to shoot a rocket-propelled grenade -LRB- RPG -RRB- , among other weapons , in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in Libya . 
Bashir is originally from the capitol Tripoli . 
His family members still live there . 
He is one of several men in a newly formed fighting unit made up of others who decided to return to their homeland to fight against Moammar Gadhafi 's regime . 
Gadhafi makes first appearance in weeks The drastic decision to leave his comfortable life in Canada was prompted by the bloody images he was seeing on the news every night . 
`` I tried to stay there and live with it , just to send money or collect donations and go and protest and stuff . 
But I realized that that 's not enough . 
And I could not sleep ; I could not work . '' 
Bashir has no trouble working now and he says he has a lot to learn . 
For one thing he 's never held a gun before . 
He is one of more than 85 men , many from abroad , who now live together , train together and pray together on a walled piece of property loaned to them by a rebel supporter . 
The man they agreed to make Commander , Mahedi , has come in from Ireland . 
Some of the others say they arrived from France , Greece , Poland , Italy , and Spain . 
None have previous military experience so they are being trained by older men in Benghazi who do . 
Mahedi says his fighters are broken up into groups : The fittest are training to be special forces , the others are learning urban warfare . 
In the compound the men are tested on things such as taking a Kalashnikov apart and putting it back together . 
They head out to the beaches of Benghazi for mortar target practice . 
The mortar rounds reach long distances so they shoot them out to sea trying to get a hold on how to hit a far off target . 
Every now and then they have to stop as a small fishing boat slowly cuts through the green-blue water . 
Then they pick up their Belgium FN rifles and begin target practice on the canisters that used to hold the mortar rounds . 
They are propped up on the sand facing the water . 
Only one of them manages to hit his target . 
It turns out it is easy to pick up a gun , but not so easy to hit your mark . 
Most of the men wear masks giving them a menacing appearance , especially as they tote their guns across the backs and chests . 
The men say they wear masks because they do not want to be identified for fear they will be recognized , making their families a target . 
They want to make clear they have no political or religious agenda beyond their mission to defend their families and further the revolution by helping to oust Gadhafi . 
`` We are just civilians . 
And we are just here to get them out and that 's it . 
I am going to throw my guns -LRB- away afterward -RRB- , '' Bashir said . 
Bashir 's family does n't even know what he is up to . 
They know he is in Libya but they do n't know why . 
He 's afraid to tell them because he suspects their phones may be bugged . 
So he trains in secret with the others , waiting for the chance to complete his mission .

2011-05-13,"By the CNN Wire Staff What Libyan rebel leaders want from U.S. Italian official had suggested that Libyan leader may be injured A top Libyan leader is in Washington to push for U.S. recognition The White House stops short of formal recognition of Transitional National Council Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The voice of embattled leader Moammar Gadhafi was heard on Libyan TV on Friday in an attempt to assure his people that he is alive and in a place where `` you can not kill me . '' 
The audio message was broadcast several times over the course of the day and expressed gratitude to people around the world who were concerned for his safety . 
`` Tell the crusader cowards that I live in a place you can not reach me , '' Gadhafi said . 
Libya 's combative leader also condemned Thursday 's attack that reportedly killed three people . 
Gadhafi left this message to NATO : `` I live in the hearts of millions , and even if you kill my body , you can not kill my soul that lives in the hearts of millions . '' 
Libya 's expat freedom fighters train The audio message was released after the Italian foreign minister raised the possibility that the Libyan leader may have been injured after weeks of NATO airstrikes in the country . 
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he did not have any evidence as to Gadhafi 's fate , but Monsignor Giovanni Martinelli , the Catholic archbishop of Tripoli , told him that Gadhafi was wounded , the Italian ANSA news agency reported . 
Martinelli said Gadhafi was most likely not in Tripoli anymore , Frattini said . 
However , Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said Friday that Ghadafi was in `` good health and high spirits '' in Tripoli . 
Four rockets struck Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound Thursday and killed at least three people , according to a Libyan government official . 
The Libyan government took journalists near the site of the blast , where smoke could be seen still rising from the compound . 
NATO military spokesman Mike Bracken said NATO had struck a command and control center but did not know whether anyone was inside . 
A top Libyan opposition leader urged formal U.S. recognition at the White House on Friday , one day after the interim council secured strong support from Britain . 
Mahmoud Jibril , president of the Libyan Transitional National Council 's Executive Bureau , and his delegation met with top Obama administration officials . 
During the meeting , National Security Adviser Tom Donilon told the leader of the Libyan opposition group that the U.S. views the group `` as a legitimate and credible interlocutor of the Libyan people , '' according to a White House statement released after the Friday meeting . 
The statement stopped short of formal recognition of the Transitional National Council . 
In an interview on CNN 's `` Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer '' on Thursday , Jibril said his main message to Donilon in Friday 's meeting would be to clear up `` misperceptions '' about extreme elements in the opposition and ask for formal recognition . 
Officials have said there are no plans to recognize the council out of concern of alienating Libyans that are not part of that group . 
They do not anticipate recognizing any one group as the official group until there is an election in Libya , officials have said . 
`` Ultimately , of course , it will be the people of Libya , not the international community , who will choose their leadership . '' 
White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday . 
`` But we do applaud the -LRB- council -RRB- for its commitment to a democratic future for Libya , '' Carney said . 
In talks Thursday with the council 's chairman , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , British Prime Minister David Cameron invited the group to establish a formal office in London . 
Cameron said Britain would also boost its presence in Benghazi , the de facto rebel capital . 
The United States has not recognized the opposition formally , although it has provided aid . 
Italy and France have recognized the opposition group . 
As the opposition sought greater support , the International Criminal Court at The Hague in the Netherlands said it will unveil Monday the names of those who are `` most responsible for crimes allegedly committed in Libya . '' 
The names will be submitted to the court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , who has been seeking warrants for three individuals in crimes against humanity allegedly committed since February , when the Libyan uprising erupted . 
Libyan state television broadcast video late Wednesday that it said showed Gadhafi meeting with tribal elders in a Tripoli hotel , marking the strongman 's first public appearance in nearly two weeks . 
The camera panned from a television program bearing the date of May 11 to the group of more than a dozen men , including Gadhafi . 
Gadhafi , wearing sunglasses and dark clothing , had not been seen on television since April 30 , the same day a NATO airstrike hit the Tripoli compound reportedly housing him and one of his sons . 
Libyan officials said at the time that Saif al-Arab Gadhafi was killed but that his father had escaped . 
Gadhafi has been firm in his attempt to retain power in Libya . 
Loyalist forces and rebel fighters , aided by NATO airstrikes , have been fighting each other for weeks . 
Libyan state television reported Friday that NATO airsrikes hit a guest house in the eastern oil town of al-Brega , killing 11 people and injuring about 45 others . 
Ibrahim condemned the attack , calling NATO `` barbaric '' and inhumane '' in its actions for striking attendees of a religious conference while they were asleep . 
He showed a video that showed the imams in prayer and then bodies being taken away . 
`` Now is this protection of civilians ? '' 
`` Is this legitimate under any Security Council resolution to kill people in their sleep ? '' 
NATO 's military office confirmed that NATO conducted an air strike in al-Brega earlier Friday but said the target was clearly identified as a command and control structure , which was being used by Gadhafi regime to coordinate attacks against the civilian population . 
And Ahmed Bani , a rebel military spokesman , denied that civilian casualties were caused by NATO strikes . 
All civilians have left the al-Brega area , Bani said . 
The remaining population are pro-Gadhafi forces and have taken up positions in civilian neighborhoods , hiding equipment and ammunition , he said . 
In the contested western city of Misrata , a doctor said rebels were able to maintain control of the airport and a civil defense base beyond the airport . 
The doctor said that at least 10 people , including two babies , were killed and at least 20 were injured Friday in sporadic shelling . 
A rebel spokesman , who asked to be identified only as Mohamed , also said rebels were controlling Misrata 's airport and civil defense base , which are about 17 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from the city center . 
In Jibril 's first official visit to Washington , the opposition leader is scheduled to meet Friday with Donilon as well as other senior administration officials and members of Congress . 
Jibril said Thursday that the United States should turn over some of Libya 's frozen assets to his group because `` a human tragedy is in the making right now . '' 
He said Libyan rebels are facing a `` big hurdle '' in getting the U.S. government to free up some of the $ 30 billion-plus in frozen Libyan assets to help those suffering under Gadhafi 's regime . 
`` Time is the crux of the matter , because having solved this problem in a matter of four or five weeks might be too late , '' Jibril told a group gathered at the Brookings Institution . 
He said he wanted to clarify a misunderstanding about the council : that it was not a political organ but an administrative one that was managing the situation in Libya until the fall of Gadhafi 's regime . 
`` The political question of who should rule Libya and how he or she should rule it , this is for the Libyan people to decide through a political democratic process based on constitutional grounds , based on an active civil society , based on equal rights and natural human rights for everybody , '' he said . 
In March , Jibril met privately with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she was in Paris for a meeting with the Group of Eight foreign ministers . 
At the State Department on May 5 , Clinton said , `` Clearly on our agenda is looking for the most effective ways to deliver financial assistance and other means of supporting and helping the opposition . ''

2011-05-13,"UNITED NATIONS | Fri May 13 , 2011 6:04 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Recent U.N. resolutions on Libya broke new ground in backing international action to protect civilians , but the stalemated civil war that has ensued could roll back those advances , diplomats and analysts say . 
Russia , China and other powers have voiced dismay that the world body has appeared to take sides in an internal conflict , not just in Libya but also in Ivory Coast , where a Security Council resolution led to the ousting of an incumbent ruler . 
As a result , veto-holders Russia and China may not be as willing in future to permit sweeping endorsements for tough action , either by a coalition -- as in Libya -- or by U.N. peacekeepers -- as in Ivory Coast , diplomats say . 
No one contests the principle of protecting civilians during armed conflict , a theme that has been on the Security Council agenda for more than a decade . 
The skeptics ' concern is that it will be used as a cover by Western powers bent on overthrowing leaders they do not like . 
More generally , it raises the specter of `` interference in the internal affairs '' of sovereign states , a taboo for Moscow and Beijing for decades . 
In Libya , a March 17 Security Council resolution authorized `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians as Tripoli looked set to crush rebels who had seized control of the east . 
Western air and missile strikes on the forces of leader Muammar Gaddafi drove them back from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
It was the first time the Council had authorized a military response to protect populations in a non-consenting state . 
In Ivory Coast , a similarly worded resolution passed on March 30 resulted in military action by French and U.N. peacekeepers that culminated 12 days later in the arrest of Laurent Gbagbo , who had refused to cede power after a presidential election the United Nations said he lost . 
As a consequence , Gbagbo 's challenger , Alassane Ouattara , took over the West African country . 
Following the two resolutions , human rights groups were ecstatic over what they saw as a new willingness by the United Nations to enforce principles to which it had long paid lip service . 
Russia and China , faced with an Arab League call for U.N. action on Libya and West African support over Ivory Coast , had abstained in the first resolution and voted for the second . 
But both soon made clear they thought the United Nations was at risk of overstepping its authority -- not protecting civilians but backing one faction in a civil conflict . 
At a Security Council debate this week , Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said it was `` unacceptable for U.N. peacekeepers ... to be drawn into armed conflict and essentially to take the side of one of the parties . '' 
Chinese Ambassador Li Baodong said , `` There must be no attempt at regime change or involvement in a civil war of a country by any party in the name of protecting civilians . '' 
Similar concerns have been expressed by Brazil , India and South Africa , which are also on the Security Council . 
The implications have not been lost on Western diplomats who had hoped the Council 's adoption of the Libya and Ivory Coast resolutions might set a precedent . 
`` There was a chance to create a model for the protection of civilians in Libya . 
But now it 's going to be very difficult in the future to persuade Russia and China to support such operations , '' a diplomat said . 
An immediate casualty could be a Western attempt to bring about Security Council action on Syria 's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters . 
`` Some people are cautious in the context of Libya , '' a diplomat commented . 
Protection of civilians is written into the mandate of at least seven U.N. peacekeeping forces around the world and has been the subject of regular reports by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor , Kofi Annan . 
These , however , have tended to focus on the soft end of the subject , such as programs to train peacekeepers , rather than the sharp end of NATO bombing a government army , as in Libya . 
The subject also has become enmeshed with an arcane debate at the United Nations over whether the world body has a `` responsibility to protect '' -- or R2P in U.N. jargon -- populations threatened by genocide or other mass atrocities . 
That concept was launched in a 2005 summit of more than 150 world leaders in a belated response to a perceived U.N. failure to prevent massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s . 
A carefully crafted declaration said the responsibility began with the government of the country concerned . 
If that failed , it foresaw a sliding scale of international action ranging from advice through mediation to -- in a last resort -- intervention by force authorized by the Security Council . 
A General Assembly conference two years ago showed that most U.N. members broadly supported R2P , but envoys from leftist states in Latin America and elsewhere denounced it as a smokescreen for `` colonialism and interventionism '' by the West . 
Some diplomats say that if the Libyan insurrection had toppled Gaddafi in a couple of weeks , rather than extending into a drawn-out civil war , concerns about how protection of civilians was to be interpreted would have been far fewer . 
Supporters of R2P say that was never likely to happen and it was too soon to say the concept was fatally damaged . 
But Ramesh Thakur of the Australian National University said , `` The evolution of R2P , and prospects of its being authorized\/used again , will depend on how Libya turns out . 
If NATO respects its limitations and success is achieved , R2P stands vindicated . 
If -LRB- resolution -RRB- 1973 -LRB- on Libya -RRB- is abused and a messy stalemate ensues , the bar will be greatly raised . ''

2011-05-14,"May 14 , 2011 | From Ivan Watson , CNN Refugees from Libya wait after disembarking from a boat onto the Italian island of Lampedusa on April 19 , 2011 . 
More than 400 people fleeing Libya and Tunisia arrived overnight in an Italian island on Saturday , the latest in a stream of refugees escaping volatile and unstable North Africa . 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said the people reached the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa in two boats , one from Libya and the other from Tunisia . 
The vessel from Libya carried 199 people fleeing the country 's civil war , and the other carried 218 Tunisians looking for better lives in Europe . 
Five boats containing 1,271 passengers reached Lampedusa on Friday . 
Many of the refugees are from sub-Saharan Africa , including Sierra Leone and Senegal . 
Others include Bangladeshis and Egyptians . 
More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February . 
Lampedusa and Malta , both islands less than an hour 's flight from the North African coast , have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration . 
At one point , the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa , which numbers less than 6,000 . 
The number of new arrivals from Tunisia has reduced somewhat , thanks in part to a recent agreement with Italy to improve patrolling along the Tunisian coast .

2011-05-14,"By Ivan Watson , Joe Duran and Livia Borghese , CNN Thousands of Libyans flee to Italy NEW : More than 1,250 have arrived by sea Four boats make it to the island safely `` Some people were in coma , '' one refugee says of the boat ride to Lampedusa Italian coast guard officers and rescue workers help offload the passengers Lampedusa , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Shortly after dawn , an open blue wooden fishing boat from Libya limped its way into the port of this tiny island , crammed with at least 166 shivering passengers , all of them apparently migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa . 
Italian coast guard officers and rescue workers helped offload the passengers , wrapping an infant in a metallic blanket and taking at least one man away on a stretcher . 
The passengers left behind husks of bread , soggy blankets , and fluorescent life jackets , scattered in the hull of the boat . 
`` I still have the trauma inside me . 
Because of the cold , the water . 
Because I 've never tried this before in my life , '' said a 21-year old man from Sierra Leone who only gave his first name Abubakr . 
Abubakr said the boat departed from the Libyan capital of Tripoli on Thursday morning and reached this tiny Italian island after a perilous 24-hour journey . 
The boat was just the first of five boats that arrived Friday carrying 1,271 passengers . 
On Saturday , two more boats carrying more than 400 people from Libya and Tunisia reached the island , the U.N. High Commissioner for Regfugees said . 
Most of the refugees are from Sub-Saharan Africa , including Sierra Leone and Senegal . 
There are also Bangladeshis , some Egyptians and Tunisians . 
`` The sea is really difficult ... I vomited so much , '' said Ibrahim Cooper , 26 , also from Sierra Leone . 
Despite reports that a similar ship sank off the coast of Libya , killing at least 16 migrants , more than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February . 
Late Thursday night , Italian authorities were tracking one boat from Libya carrying 250 migrants that was said to be leaking . 
That vessel is believed to now be in the territorial waters of Malta . 
Passengers onboard Friday morning 's boat said they made the journey to escape the fighting in Libya . 
`` It 's a war situation now , '' Abubakr said . 
`` Anything can happen . 
That 's why we have to run for our lives . 
Because we are blacks . 
We are not secure in that country . '' 
Cooper huddled on the pavement of the port , eating a biscuit distributed by Italian emergency workers . 
`` We are now refugees in Italy , '' Cooper said . 
`` The Italian government and the E.U. should do something to help us . '' 
The armada of leaky boats full of migrants that have flooded Lampedusa over the past three months has become a hot-button political issue both in Italy and the European Union . 
A diplomatic spat erupted recently when France prevented a train carrying dozens of Tunisian migrants from crossing the border from Italy . 
I still have the trauma inside me . 
Because of the cold , the water . 
Because I 've never tried this before in my life . 
Meanwhile , this week , the Danish government announced it would begin checking passports at the border of Denmark . 
These measures threaten to undermine the Schengen agreement , which allows free movement across European borders . 
One unexpected consequence of the revolutions that have swept through North Africa is the collapse of border controls in Tunisia and Libya . 
Lampedusa and Malta , both islands less than an hour 's flight from the North African coast , have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration . 
At one point , the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa , which numbers less than 6,000 . 
Migrants slept in the streets of this small fishing port . 
Dozens of blue fishing boats from Tunisia and Libya are piled up in a boat graveyard outside Lampedusa 's small commercial port . 
Nearby , graffiti on a wall says `` Basta Siamo Pieni , '' meaning , `` Enough , we are full . '' 
Today , the number of new arrivals from Tunisia has reduced somewhat , thanks in part to a recent agreement with Italy to improve patrolling along the Tunisian coast . 
But as the war rages on in Libya , the number of barely seaworthy vessels departing Tripoli for Europe has increased drastically . 
A local priest is planning to hold a memorial service in Lampedusa later Friday for three other migrants who washed up on the shore of this small Mediterranean island last Sunday . 
The boat they are believed to have traveled on lies on its side on the rocky shore of Lampedusa days after it ran aground .

2011-05-16,"Credit : Reuters\/Libyan TV via Reuters TV THE HAGUE | Mon May 16 , 2011 7:33 am EDT THE HAGUE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The International Criminal Court prosecutor said on Monday he had requested arrest warrants for Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi , his son Saif al-Islam and the country 's spy chief on charges of crimes against humanity . 
ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo had said earlier this month he would seek three arrest warrants for the `` pre-determined '' killing of protesters in Libya following U.N. Security Council referral of the violence to the Hague-based court in February . 
It had been widely expected that Moreno-Ocampo would seek an arrest warrant for Libyan leader Gaddafi , but in addition to a warrant for his son Saif , the prosecutor said he would also seek the arrest of Libya 's head of espionage , Abdullah al-Senussi . 
`` The office gathered direct evidence about orders issued by Muammar Gaddafi himself , direct evidence of Saif al-Islam organizing the recruitment of mercenaries and direct evidence of the participation of al-Senussi in the attacks against demonstrators , '' Moreno-Ocampo said at the ICC . 
He added the office of the prosecutor also documented how the three held meetings `` to plan the operations '' and Gaddafi used his `` absolute authority to commit crimes in Libya '' . 
The ICC prosecutor has moved with unprecedented swiftness in his investigation , with the request for arrest warrants coming just two and a half months after it the Security Council referral . 
Moreno-Ocampo said the swiftness of his investigation stems from global consensus that the crimes committed in Libya had to be investigated , although judges will now need to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to issue warrants . 
The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to enforce arrests . 
Despite NATO bombing operations intended to protect civilians , Libya has been plunged into civil war , seriously complicating efforts to arrest ICC suspects .

What Muammar Gaddafi has allegedly done is a joke in comparison . 
Libya now has two governments both semi-functional . 
The pro-regime one has its spokesman already killed by NATO bomb and many defected diplomats . 
The pro-rebellion one has yet to acquire more sovereign recognition . 
Gaddafi built his command center underneath a kindergarten .

He will fight from his bunker even all his compounds turned into rubble .

2011-05-16,"Eni CEO sees Libya `` problem '' over in a year : report MILAN | Mon May 16 , 2011 3:24 am EDT MILAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italian oil firm Eni SpA expects the `` Libyan problem '' to be over in a year and is not worried for the longer term , Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said in an interview published on Monday . 
Eni , the biggest foreign oil business operator in Libya , has said it expects the civil war in the North African nation to cut its production total for the full year after an almost 9 percent drop in the first quarter . 
`` Personally , I have no doubt that one year from now the Libyan problem will be behind us , '' Scaroni told the Financial Times . 
He added : `` I am still not worried about the future . 
I 'm worried about the present because the political situation in Libya is difficult , there is no possibility of producing in Libya and , as a consequence , the only activity is to protect our installations there . '' 
Scaroni said he had not the `` smallest doubt '' that once political order is re-established in Libya , Eni 's position will be as strong as it has been in the past , whoever will be in charge , the newspaper said . 
Eni gets about 13 percent of its oil and gas production from Libya .

2011-05-17,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As U.S. military action in Libya approaches the 60-day mark this Friday , does the Congress need to vote to continue that involvement to comply with the War Powers Act ? 
Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Tuesday he is `` talking to the administration '' about what exactly Congress and the White House might do to abide by the 1973 law which says Congress must authorize any military action that lasts more than 60 days . 
`` We want to make sure we 're not stretching anything inappropriate . 
So we 're looking at some language , '' Kerry said as he entered a weekly policy lunch in the Capitol with Democratic senators . 
`` We 're really looking at it very seriously to keep everyone on the same page . '' 
Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , a vocal advocate of U.S. military support for the Libyan rebels , has been in talks for weeks with Democrats and Republicans about a resolution backing the Libya mission - but perhaps something short of voting on a War Powers resolution . 
He said Tuesday that congressional leadership has not shown an `` inclination '' to vote on something . 
McCain said he does n't believe the War Powers Act is constitutional and therefore he does n't believe the president needs congressional authorization to continue the mission . 
`` I 've never recognized the constitutionality of the War Powers Act , nor has any president , either Republican or Democrat , '' McCain said . 
Sen. Kerry and Sen. McCain are out front on this issue and that 's good ! 
With the whirlwing going on in the middle east right now , every member of the Armed Services Committee and Intelligence Committee need to be fully engaged in these uprisings . 
As far as the War Powers Act goes , it 's the law and it 's nothing we can do about it . 
Therefore , there should be an ongoing resolution to maintain the constitutionality of the provision . 
May 17 , 2011 04:08 pm at 4:08 pm | It 's unfortunate for everyone involved that this is dragging out so long . 
If we are determined that this is a fight worth fighting , why are we not overwhelming the Ghadaffi government with force and getting on with it ? 
I like Ronald Reagan 's approach to armed conflict when and only when it becomes necessary ; '' We win . 
You lose . '' . 
Keep it simple like that and it is better for everyone involved , including the Libyan people . 
May 17 , 2011 04:13 pm at 4:13 pm | Democrat Class Warfare - Destroying the economy , destroying the country -LRB- the very real deal -RRB- But are n't we ` leading from behind '' in Libya ? 
Why do they need to do anything ? 
Do the Democrats actually want to conduct a vote in Congress on us getting involved in a Libyan civil war ? 
Now this ought to be interesting . 
May 17 , 2011 04:16 pm at 4:16 pm | Actually yes , this is consistent with the simple approach . 
If you make a decision to use force , it must be all or nothing . 
Unless he saw where defeating a specific target was meaningful and a solution to the problem , then it would be nothing . 
The point is , once you have identified an enemy and made a decision to use force , it should be only with overwhelming force to end quickly with a win . 
Otherwise , do n't go there .

2011-05-17,"Luis Moreno-Ocampo is the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court . 
Security forces in Libya are allegedly using sexual enhancement drugs as a `` machete '' and gang-raping women they stop at checkpoints , the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has said . 
Luis Moreno-Ocampo told CNN Monday that the court in The Hague will investigate allegations of institutionalized rape in the war-torn country . 
`` There are rapes . 
The issue is who organized them , '' Luis Moreno-Ocampo told CNN 's Nic Robertson . 
`` They were committed in some police barracks . 
Were the policemen prosecuted ? 
Moreno-Ocampo said the criminal court has information about women who were stopped at checkpoints and , because they were carrying the flag of the rebels , were taken by police and gang raped . 
He also said there were reports of the use of male sexual enhancement drugs , which he called a `` tool of massive rape . '' 
`` There 's some information with Viagra . 
So , it 's like a machete , '' he said . 
`` It 's new . 
Viagra is a tool of massive rape . 
`` So we are investigating . 
We are not ready to present the case yet , but I hope in the coming month , we 'll add charges or review the charges for rapes . '' 
In late April , various media organizations -- including Foreign Policy magazine -- reported that Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , told a closed-door U.N. Security Council hearing that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been distributing Viagra pills to his troops `` so they go out and rape . '' 
The magazine , which attributed the information to a U.N. diplomat in the room , said Rice did not offer any evidence to support her claim . 
Pfizer , the maker of the drug , could not be reached early Tuesday morning for comment . 
It was also not clear whether Moreno-Ocampo used the term `` Viagra '' as a catch-all for male sexual enhancement drugs in general . 
Perhaps the best-known alleged rape case in Libya is that of Eman al-Obeidy . 
Al-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 , when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while journalists staying there were having breakfast . 
She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while beaten and raped by 15 men loyal to Gadhafi . 
While notable for the international attention it received , al-Obeidy 's case may not be an exception . 
Moreno-Ocampo did not say how many women might have been raped in Libya since the start of the civil war . 
`` The shooting is in the public space . 
The arresting people is so massive , so pervasive , '' said Moreno-Ocampo . ''

2011-05-17,"TRIPOLI\/TUNIS | Tue May 17 , 2011 7:28 pm EDT TRIPOLI\/TUNIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The chairman of Libya 's National Oil Corporation has defected from Muammar Gaddafi 's administration and fled to neighboring Tunisia , a Tunisian security source said on Tuesday . 
Libyan rebels also said they had information that Shokri Ghanem , 68 , had defected , a move that if confirmed would deal a major blow to Gaddafi 's efforts to shore up his 41-year rule . 
`` He is in a hotel with a group of other Libyan officials , '' the Tunisian source told Reuters , saying Ghanem had been staying in the south of the country . 
Another Tunisian security source said he was on his way to the capital Tunis . 
A government official in Tripoli said there was no sign Ghanem had defected . 
Three months into the unrest , rebels hold Benghazi and the oil-producing east of Libya , helped by a NATO bombing campaign sanctioned at the United Nations to protect civilians . 
But the military victory rebels once sought seems a distant prospect and many pin their hopes on a collapse of central power in Tripoli driven by disaffection and defections . 
Ghanem , an internationally respected technocrat , is credited with liberalizing Libya 's economy and energy sector . 
Rebel finance and oil minister Ali Tarhouni told Reuters on a visit to Doha that he understood Ghanem had left his post , and said he hoped to represent Libya at an OPEC meeting in June . 
Libya is estimated to have lost two thirds of its oil output since the unrest began three months ago . 
Rebels and Arab media reported on a previous occasion that the U.S.-educated Ghanem had stepped down but he appeared later and said he was in his office and working as usual . 
The most prominent Libyan defector so far is Moussa Koussa , the former foreign minister , who fled to Britain earlier this year . 
Libyan state television said Libyan forces had hit a NATO warship that was shelling areas of the rebel-held city of Misrata , but NATO denied the report , saying it was `` totally fabricated . '' 
A doctor in the western city said at least seven people were killed during fighting between rebels and government forces earlier in the day . 
Most of the dead were believed to be rebels . 
British aircraft and navy ships attacked a training base for bodyguards for Gaddafi 's inner circle and intelligence buildings in the capital , the British Defense Ministry said on Tuesday . 
In central Tripoli , NATO airstrikes hit two buildings including one a Libyan spokesman said contained files detailing corruption cases against government officials who have defected . 
Officials summoned reporters after the attack in the early hours to visit the two damaged buildings , which they said housed security forces and Libya 's anti-corruption agency . 
One building was in flames . 
Thousands have been killed in the Libyan conflict , the bloodiest revolt of what has been called the `` Arab Spring '' of protests that has removed autocratic leaders in Tunis and Cairo . 
Libyan rebels briefly pulled back from the Dehiba-Wazin border post on the frontier with southern Tunisia on Tuesday . 
Five were killed and several wounded by Libyan government shellfire , they said . 
At least four Russian-made Grad rockets fired from Libya landed inside Tunisia during the clashes . 
The crossing is on a supply route for rebels in Libya 's Western Mountains and is an exit point for injured fighters . 
Tunisia said it would refer Tripoli to the U.N. Security Council if Libya fired across the border again . 
Russia hosted a representative of Gaddafi 's government in Moscow on Tuesday and called on Tripoli to stop using force against civilians , comply fully with U.N. Security Council resolutions and withdraw armed groups from cities . 
`` The answer we heard can not be called negative , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters . 
He suggested Gaddafi 's government was making such steps conditional on NATO and rebels calling a halt to the use of force . 
Libya was ready to look at peace proposals based on those suggested by the African Union and to comply with Security Council resolutions , he said . 
`` The only things that our interlocutors from Tripoli noted today was the necessity of the insurgents accepting analogous steps and that NATO also stop bombing , '' Lavrov said , adding that it remained to agree terms and a timeframe for a truce . 
Both the rebels and Western nations have rejected past ceasefire proposals , saying the only deal they would accept was one under which Gaddafi relinquished power . 
The proposal set out by the Russian foreign minister made no mention of that .

2011-05-18,"From Jomana Karadsheh and Nima Elbagir , CNN Nigel Chandler , from left , Manuel Varela , James Foley and Clare Morgana Gillis arrive at Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on Wednesday . 
Four foreign journalists covering the Libyan conflict are released and fined Meanwhile , Tunisia condemns Libya 's firing of rockets at a Tunisian border town UNICEF announces an effort to raise $ 20 million for Libyan women and children Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four journalists are free weeks after they were captured by the Libyan military and then sentenced to jail for a year , a Libyan government spokesman said Wednesday . 
Meanwhile , the Tunisian government condemned Libya 's alleged continuous firing of rockets at the border town of Dhiba , a Tunisian foreign ministry source told the Tunisian News Agency . 
Also , fighting resumed Wednesday between rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi at the Dhehiba\/Wazen border crossing with Tunisia , according to the Tunisian state-run news agency . 
Significant reinforcements joined the rebels while government troops responded with heavy artillery , the agency said . 
Battle in Libya rages on Libya troops using rape as a weapon ? 
At the same time , UNICEF announced a humanitarian campaign to raise $ 20 million for children and women inside Libya and for nearly 800,000 refugees who have fled to neighboring countries including Tunisia . 
The freed journalists include two Americans : Clare Morgana Gillis , a freelancer for the Christian Science Monitor , the Atlantic and USA Today ; and James Foley of GlobalPost . 
The others are Spanish photographer Manuel Varela , who also goes by the name Manu Brabo , and British journalist Nigel Chandler , Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said . 
Ibrahim said a judge released the four journalists after ordering them each to pay a $ 164 fine for entering the country illegally . 
Ibrahim did n't know if the journalists had paid the fines yet . 
When asked about missing South African photographer Anton Hemmerl , Ibrahim said the government is n't holding him and has n't been able to locate him . 
`` We never had him with us at any stage , '' Ibrahim said . 
Ibrahim spoke with the four journalists after they arrived in the lobby of the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli and told them they are welcome to stay and work in Libya under a visa . 
South Africa 's ambassador to Libya was also at the hotel trying to get any information on Hemmerl . 
The four freed journalists were to spend the night at the hotel Wednesday , with their rooms paid for by the Libyan government , and then be driven to the Tunisian border , Ibrahim said . 
Gillis , Varela and Foley were detained by pro-government forces in early April , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists . 
Once taken to the border with Tunisia , Varela will head home to Spain , the Spanish foreign ministry said in a statement . 
The foreign ministry declined to give any details earlier this month about Varela 's situation , due to the `` discretion and prudence '' that his case demands , but Spanish media reported April 24 that he talked by phone to his parents in northern Spain and told them he was safe and being treated well . 
Spain still has an embassy in Tripoli , although it evacuated its personnel from the city , like many other nations , as fighting between the regime of Moammar Gadhafi and rebels intensified in late March . 
When asked about journalists being mistreated while in Libyan custody since violence erupted in February , Ibrahim said all journalists were treated `` fairly '' and `` as good as possible , '' but he pointed out that the country is in armed conflict , and the military did n't know for sure whether persons captured were indeed journalists . 
Ibrahim added that many former military personnel from Europe are now working with the rebels . 
Since February , the Committee to Protect Journalists has tallied more than 80 attacks on members of the news media in Libya , including four deaths and 49 detentions . 
Human Rights Watch and CPJ have called upon the Libyan government to account for missing journalists covering the conflict there . 
Meanwhile , in Tunis , the government charged that Libya 's rocket-firing at Tunisia is a violation of its sovereignty and puts citizens and infrastructure at risk , even though Tripoli pledged several times not to fire in the direction of Tunisia , the foreign ministry source told the Tunisian News Agency . 
The Tunisian government warned of `` immediate and disastrous consequences '' to bilateral relations and said the `` serious '' attacks are likely to force Tunis to take `` severe '' measures such as reporting the violations to the U.N. secretary general in order `` to defend its territorial integrity , '' the source told the news agency . 
In a related matter to Libya , UNICEF issued its appeal to raise $ 20 million for the Libyan crisis and said more than 1 million people may have been affected by the conflict , especially as almost 800,000 Libyans have fled to Egypt , Algeria , Niger , Chad , Sudan and Tunisia , the group said in a statement Wednesday . 
`` Children have been deeply affected by this conflict . 
Their rights to learn , to play and to express themselves have been compromised . 
UNICEF and partners are working to support the community in their solidarity to create safe spaces for all Libyan children , '' Shahida Azfar , UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and north Africa , said in a statement .

2011-05-18,"TUNIS\/TRIPOLI | Wed May 18 , 2011 7:32 pm EDT TUNIS\/TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The wife and daughter of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi crossed the border into Tunisia , a Tunisian security source said , but it was unclear whether they were on a diplomatic mission or seeking safe haven . 
Arabic television stations quoted Tunisian officials as denying that the family members were in the country , saying that Safia Gaddafi and her daughter Aisha were on a U.N. sanctions list and would therefore not be allowed in . 
However , the security source said the two women came to Tunisia with a Libyan delegation on May 14 and have been staying on the southern island of Djerba near the Libyan border . 
It did not appear that they were traveling with Shokri Ghanem , Libya 's top oil official , who is believed to have also crossed into Tunisia several days ago and defected . 
Government officials in Tripoli were not immediately available for comment . 
The Tunisian Interior Ministry denied that any members of the Gaddafi family were in the country in remarks to Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya TV . 
Al Jazeera quoted a ministry spokesman as saying Tunisia would arrest any members of the Gaddafi family should they enter the country under a U.N.-imposed travel ban . 
A Libyan opposition source said the women were in Djerba to accompany Aisha 's husband , who he said had been injured in the Libyan conflict , and was seeking treatment in Tunisia . 
A commentator on a daily political talkshow on state-run Libyan TV dismissed reports Gaddafi and members of his family had left Libya as `` rumors '' and `` psychological war '' spread by rebels and the West . 
`` Those people -LRB- Gaddafi and his children -RRB- live among other people and if any of those rumors were true it would be possible to find this out , '' the commentator said . 
Italian officials have speculated that Gaddafi , who has been in power for four decades , was wounded during a NATO air strike in the capital last month which killed his youngest son and three of his grandchildren . 
Libyan television has shown footage of the leader since the bombardment and aired an audio message in which he taunted NATO forces , saying he was in a place where their artillery could not reach him . 
Since the revolt began in February against Gaddafi 's rule , Aisha Gaddafi has made several public appearances backing her father , and attacking the rebels and Western powers trying to overthrow him . 
A month ago she appeared at her father 's Bab al-Aziziyah compound in Tripoli and addressed cheering crowds of supporters in an event broadcast live on Libyan state television . 
`` Talk about Gaddafi stepping down is an insult to all Libyans because Gaddafi is not in Libya , but in the hearts of all Libyans , '' she said . 
On Tuesday , Libyan rebels and a Tunisian security source said the head of Libya 's National Oil Corporation , Shokri Ghanem , had defected and fled to Tunisia . 
If confirmed , the defection would undermine Gaddafi 's efforts to cling to power . 
Ghanem would be the most senior Libyan official to defect since former foreign minister Moussa Koussa switched sides in Britain earlier this year after passing through Tunisia .

2011-05-19,"NATO aircraft target Tripoli 's seaport From the CNN Wire Staff Smoke rises from a fire on a boat on Thursday in Tripoli after NATO air strikes targeted the port of the Libyan capital . 
Libyan official says commercial and military areas were struck NATO says its attack struck eight of Gadhafi 's warships Libyan spokesman calls Obama `` delusional '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO aircraft targeted warships overnight , striking eight of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's vessels in Tripoli 's seaport , the organization said Friday morning . 
A Libyan government official said the targets included commercial vessels as well as military ones . 
`` All NATO 's targets are military in nature and are directly linked to the Gadhafi regime 's systematic attacks on the Libyan people , '' said Rear Adm. Russell Harding , deputy commander of Operation Unified Protector . 
`` Given the escalating use of naval assets , NATO had no choice but to take decisive action to protect the civilian population of Libya and NATO forces at sea . '' 
In a statement , NATO said the attack occurred after two weeks of escalating use of government maritime forces that had disrupted the flow of humanitarian assistance . 
All the vessels targeted were naval warships with no civilian utility , said Harding . 
But a Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area said the commercial port , not the nearby military port , was hit . 
From the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area , it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit . 
The port 's general manager , Mohammed Ahmed Rashed , told reporters that six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel , which had been in dock for maintenance . 
The port remained operational , he said . 
Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called the attack a `` clear attempt to bring the nation to its knees , '' and said the port serves as the main entry point for food and other critical supplies into the country . 
`` The nation will starve , '' he said . 
Battle in Libya rages on Libya troops using rape as a weapon ? 
Libya 's al-Obeidy : ` My soul is liberated ' Still , though the port was in disarray , the damage did not appear major , he said . 
Ibrahim 's claims came as President Barack Obama , addressing a global audience , condemned the use of force against Arab Spring protesters by longtime allies and adversaries alike . 
`` Obama is still delusional , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` He believes the lies that his own government is spreading around the world and his own media is spreading around the world . 
They have not proved one single charge against us and they refuse to investigate us . '' 
He added , `` It 's not Obama who decides whether Moammar Gadhafi leaves Libya or not . 
It 's the Libyan people who decide their future . '' 
The report of the attack came shortly after at least three explosions could be heard in the city . 
A government official said five airstrikes had targeted the port and the police academy was also hit on Thursday , during which NATO jets could be seen been flying overhead throughout the day . 
Libyan state-run television reported the strikes with a `` breaking news '' font that said , `` Military source : Residential and military locations in Tripoli are currently being shelled by NATO forces . '' 
Earlier Thursday , crowds of Libyans took to the streets of Tripoli , honking horns and dancing in the streets in support of the country 's leader , Moammar Gadhafi . 
More than 100 people outside the headquarters of state television chanted `` God , Moammar and Libya only '' and other pro-Gadhafi and anti-rebel slogans . 
The demonstrations were sparked , apparently , in response to state-run television reports that parts of the rebel capital Benghazi were `` rejecting the colonialists and their followers , '' as the government describes NATO and the rebels . 
A group of journalists , including a CNN team , was taken by government minders to see the celebrations in Tripoli . 
Among the crowds composed predominantly of young men were a number of families -- including fathers carrying children on their shoulders . 
One woman , who brought her 10-year-old-daughter , carried a portrait of the Libyan leader and said they were celebrating their country being united again . 
Many then drove toward Tripoli 's Green Square singing and honking their horns , waving Libya 's green flag and portraits of Gadhafi . 
But CNN journalists in Benghazi saw no indications of counter-revolutionary uprisings or protests there . 
And the National Transitional Council denied government claims that pro-Gadhafi forces had seized control of the city . 
And residents of Benghazi said they had not seen or heard of pro-Gadhafi rallies there . 
Two months ago , Gadhafi loyalists in Tripoli erupted in similar cheers when state media incorrectly reported that Tobruk and Benghazi had fallen to government troops . 
Gadhafi has been fighting to keep control of his country in the face of an uprising that has led to a number of key cities falling into rebel control . 
The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court this week requested a warrant for Gadhafi 's arrest on charges of crimes against humanity .

Here is something for those of you on the right to consider . 
Pakistan turned a blind eye towards Osam Bin Ladin for 6 years or so : Why did someone in their intelligence community give him up now ? 
Maybe the saw the `` Gadafi plan '' and thought better of hiding that SOB . 
The problem is that those to the left of me think that the military could never do anything right and you on the right think that my President ca n't do anything right . 
Well both ends of the spectrum are wrong on this one .

2011-05-19,"By the CNN Wire Staff A rebel listens to President Obama 's speech on TV while guarding an oil terminal in the Libyan town of Zuwaytinah on Thursday . 
Rebels call Obama 's speech `` positive for Libya '' An Egyptian viewer says reform needs `` a steady push '' A U.S. analyst calls the speech `` more timid than it needed to be '' What did you think of Obama 's speech ? 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Voices around the Middle East and North Africa gave mixed grades to Barack Obama 's address on the region Thursday , with Libyan rebels calling it `` good enough '' and a Palestinian official calling it a `` half-full glass . '' 
In Benghazi , the heart of the Libyan revolt against longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi , a rebel leader pronounced Obama 's speech in support of democratic movements across the region `` good enough . '' 
`` Overall , the speech was positive for Libya , '' said Jalal el-Gallal , a spokesman for the National Transitional Council . 
Rebel leaders were pleased to hear Obama call their provisional government `` legitimate and credible , '' remarks that raised hopes of eventual U.S. recognition as the country 's rightful government -- and accompanying aid . 
`` Hopefully , they will recognize our aspirations , '' el-Gallal said . 
`` They will recognize us fully , and we can bring this chapter to an end . '' 
Obama : Our message is simple CNN 's Zakaria on Obama Arab Speech Obama pushes Mideast policy change In his Washington speech , Obama pledged U.S. support for reform efforts across the Middle East and North Africa , warning leaders facing popular upheavals that `` strategies of oppression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore . '' 
It comes amid the Arab Spring , popular revolts that have driven two regional autocrats from power and fueled calls for reform or open revolts in several other countries . 
He also pledged additional economic aid for longtime U.S. ally Egypt and said the United States and European Union would push for expanded trade with the region . 
That was good news for Riad Greiss , who watched Obama 's address from a Cairo coffeehouse . 
Greiss said tourism -- one of the pillars of Egypt 's economy -- has dried up since the pro-democracy protests that drove Hosni Mubarak from power after three decades . 
`` We are feeling it 's getting worse , not better , '' Greiss told CNN . 
Greiss , an engineer from Egypt 's Coptic Christian minority , said Egypt 's revolution `` needs time . 
It needs a steady push , but time . '' 
On the eve of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , the American leader restated the U.S. desire for a comprehensive settlement of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
His call for an agreement based on Israel 's pre-1967 borders drew criticism from Netanyahu , who called those frontiers `` indefensible , '' but Obama also poured cold water on Palestinian efforts to seek a unilateral declaration of statehood at the United Nations . 
Nabil Shaath , a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas , called the speech a `` half-full glass . '' 
He told CNN that Abbas would review the speech with all Palestinian factions and present Obama with some `` specific requirements '' for translating his rhetoric into `` a real peace process . '' 
On Syria , Obama praised the courage of Syrian protesters who have defied a violent crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad and blasted al-Assad 's government for choosing `` the path of murder '' in response to calls for democratic change . 
Al-Assad , he said , `` now has a choice : He can lead that transition or get out of the way . '' 
But on the social media site Twitter , a supporter of the Syrian revolt sounded a note of disappointment . 
`` We Syrians started this alone and if ur too afraid to take action , we can handle this alone , '' the poster said . 
Obama 's passing reference to Yemen , in which he urged embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh to `` follow through '' on his reported agreement to step down after 32 years in power , drew mixed reviews from anti-government protesters there . 
`` We wanted Obama to directly call Saleh to leave office the same way he did with Mubarak , '' said Saleh Kayyat , a youth leader in the capital Sanaa . 
`` He did not do that . 
This is wrong , and he is not being honest with the wave of change in the Middle East . '' 
Another protester , Ala'a Jarban , told CNN , `` We had hoped to hear more . '' 
But Obama `` spoke directly to the Yemeni people , '' Jarban said . 
`` That 's something we 're not used to hearing , and it 's an improvement . 
But we realize that President Obama can not give as much to the Yemeni people as we can give to ourselves . '' 
And Michele Dunne , a former White House and State Department expert on the Middle East , said Obama 's address was `` a lot more timid than it needed to be . '' 
`` He spoke a lot more about self-determination and reform than he did about broader concepts like democracy and freedom , '' Dunne told CNN . 
`` He has been pretty cautious about approaching these changes in the Middle East , '' added Dunne , now an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . 
`` At least now he has said openly ... that the United States will stand up for its principles in its actions toward the Middle East . ''

2011-05-19,"LONDON | Thu May 19 , 2011 11:32 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The European Union is considering tightening sanctions on the government of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi by blacklisting ports to prevent exports of oil and imports of fuel , a Western diplomatic source told Reuters .

Full Article EXCLUSIVE - EU seen tightening Libyan sanctions , include ports LONDON\/BRUSSELS | Thu May 19 , 2011 11:27 pm IST LONDON\/BRUSSELS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The European Union is considering tightening sanctions on the government of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi by blacklisting ports to prevent exports of oil and imports of fuel , Western diplomatic sources told Reuters . 
One source said EU experts have reached an agreement over putting six ports of the OPEC nation -- Tripoli , Zuara , Zawiyah , Al-Khoms , Ras Lanuf and Brega -- on the list and proposals could be submitted to the EU sanctions committee next week . 
Another EU diplomat said `` a number of EU states '' believed it would be a sensible next step , and it was possible it would be discussed by foreign ministers who meet in Brussels on Monday , although it was not formally on the agenda . 
Gaddafi 's government is seeking to raise fuel imports by using a loophole in international sanctions after two months of western air strikes against Libya . 
Civil war has crippled the refining industry and Gaddafi urgently needs fuel imports for his military and to keep civilian vehicles running in the areas he controls . 
`` West Libya 's supply of refined products is still sufficient . 
Western powers want a lot more control over supplies to Libya , '' one source said . 
`` The concern is that a stalemate will ensue in the war . '' 
The discussions will likely take place at the level of the EU sanctions committee next week and could become law by early June if it is successful , he added . 
A third EU diplomat said there was `` relatively strong '' backing for the idea , which was proposed by Britain , but political agreement would be needed from all 27 EU states and it could therefore take more time . 
The discussions may also involve the Libyan state-owned shipping company General National Maritime Transport Company -LRB- GNMTC -RRB- which is not on the sanctions list and has managed to bring at least one fuel cargo into west Libya . 
EU , U.N. and U.S. sanctions against Libya are implemented through a list of companies that are excluded from business , but exports to western Libya or dealings with firms missing from the list are not forbidden . 
Prime Minister David Cameron said earlier this month Britain sees scope for tightening sanctions on oil and oil products against Gaddafi . 
Reuters revealed in April that Libya had received at least one shipment via a ship-to-ship transfer in Tunisia and on Wednesday reported that west Libya is expected to receive a fuel cargo that recently visited Turkish and Georgian ports . 
Both states deny a role in the transaction . 
The idea to target ports follows a similar EU decision in the Ivory Coast in January to pressure the incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo of the cocoa producer to quit after an election he was widely seen to have lost . 
`` The international community tried to sanction ports for the first time earlier this year during the conflict in Ivory Coast and it worked , '' one of the sources said . 
Susannah Cogman , partner in the corporate crime and investigations team of law firm Herbert Smith , saw the proposal as a move towards increasingly targeted sanctions . 
`` This is novel in that it 's using financial sanctions to address specific geographical trade issues . 
That 's unusual , '' she said . 
But she added that these sanctions would be limited to acts , individuals and companies within the EU .

2011-05-20,"Near the Libya-Tunisia border , a rebel spotter watches rockets strike a few kilometers from the vital crossing . 
NEW : The attack on Zintan began at dawn Thursday and continued through Friday African Union leaders to meet May 25-26 on Libyan conflict Overnight airstrikes target ships in three Libyan ports Zintan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi have unleashed their biggest attack yet against a rebel stronghold in the mountains of western Libya , one of the Libyan leader 's former generals said Friday . 
The attack began at dawn Thursday , the former commander said . 
He now commands rebels in Zintan , using the name Hajj Usama . 
The attack began Thursday when about 150 of Gadhafi 's infantry troops began firing on three fronts near Zintan , he said . 
They were supported by about 40 vehicles , including long-range `` Grad '' rocket launchers and 14.5 mm heavy machine guns with a range of 6 kilometers . 
Zintan lies about 90 miles southwest of the capital , Tripoli . 
Zintan , population 40,000 , is at the eastern tip of a 170-mile ribbon of rebel-held mountains that stretch westward from the Tunisian border . 
After decades in the Libyan army , including a tour of duty in neighboring Chad , Hajj Usama said he now despises his former commander in chief , whom he called a terrorist . 
Battle in Libya rages on Libya troops using rape as a weapon ? 
Libya 's al-Obeidy : ` My soul is liberated ' NATO strikes hit Libyan warships `` He 's never used infantry like this , '' said the trim , gray-bearded rebel commander . 
In previous battles , Hajj Usama said , Gadhafi 's artillery forces had taken over nearby civilian housing in Zuwail al Bagul and shelled from a distance . 
Gadhafi 's forces simultaneously attacked Thursday on three fronts , Hajj Usama said -- to the north of Zintan , firing Grad rockets into the eastern part of the nearby town of Rayayna , and attacking to the southeast and to the east of Zintan . 
In response , he dispatched hundreds of fighters to cut off Gadhafi 's advance , Hajj Usama said . 
As of Friday night , one rebel was dead and three were wounded , one of them critically , he said . 
Fresh trenches cut deep in the stark , red sand here underscore the rebels ' readiness to continue defending the town . 
The absence of Gadhafi 's forces has buoyed the confidence of the rebel fighters . 
Some of the fighters who returned late Friday from the front lines -- crammed into the backs of pickup trucks -- appeared to be school-age . 
They carried only a handful of weapons , a few hunting rifles and old , bolt-action shotguns . 
Nevertheless , Hajj Osama said , `` they are keen and determined to fight for their freedom . '' 
The attack that began Thursday , he speculated , was intended to regain control of Rayayna , population 12,000 . 
Residents east of the town had `` declared their support for the rebels a month ago , '' he said , while the rest of the town remains loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security , Nasar al Mabout . 
Hajj Usama said al Mabout lives there . 
Since the raids began , Hajj Usama said , he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayna with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling . 
As dusk fell Friday the shelling visible earlier from the roofs of Zintan abated . 
But shortly before 10 p.m. , the attack resumed with sporadic barrages of gunfire . 
The rebels said the night shelling may have been intended to terrorize Zintan 's residents so they would flee . 
Some have , but most were staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over , Hajj Usama said . 
Early Friday , NATO jets pounded Libyan ports , destroying eight of Gadhafi 's warships , an alliance spokesman said . 
NATO targeted the ships in Tripoli , Al-Khums and Sirte after it was apparent that Gadhafi 's forces were increasingly using naval vessels to launch attacks on civilians , said Mike Bracken , NATO 's military spokesman . 
Gadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid , Bracken said . 
`` He was using maritime forces to lay mines . 
These were legal targets , '' Bracken said at a briefing in Brussels , Belgium . 
He did not say whether crew members were aboard when the ships were hit . 
The NATO campaign is progressing and Gadhafi 's combat power had been severely curtailed , Bracken said . 
But the Libyan leader 's forces continued their heavy shelling of Dehiba , on the Tunisian border , where thousands of refugees have amassed in recent weeks . 
The border crossing , through which humanitarian aid is often trucked in , was closed Friday . 
Along the southern borders , rebels had gained control of border crossings between Libya and Sudan and Libya and Chad and had regained control of Kufra in the southeast , according to a report by the International Medical Corps , which has teams in Libya and Tunisia . 
The global medical organization said rebel control along the Chad border was significant because supplies flow through there to Gadhafi 's forces . 
`` While control of the entire border will be difficult , the rebels are reported to have a large force in the region , '' it said . 
`` The Niger and Morocco border crossings remain under Gadhafi control . '' 
Meanwhile , the African Union announced it will hold a two-day meeting of heads of state in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa next week to address the conflict in Libya , as well as other security issues in Africa . 
In another development , the family of South African freelance photojournalist Anton Hammerl , who has been missing in Libya since April , said late Thursday they believe he was killed by Libyan government forces . 
The statement was posted on the `` Free photographer Anton Hammerl '' Facebook page and followed interviews given in The New York Times , Global Post and The Atlantic by two journalists who said they were with him when he was shot . 
`` On 5 April 2011 , Anton was shot by Gaddafi 's forces in an extremely remote location in the Libyan desert . 
According to eyewitnesses , his injuries were such that he could not have survived without medical attention , '' according to the Facebook statement . 
Hammerl was last reportedly seen in a remote region of the Libyan desert . 
He was reportedly captured by Gadhafi 's forces near the town of al-Brega , a key oil town in eastern Libya , that has been the site of intense fighting .

2011-05-21,"Libyan rebels change a tire on a gun truck on the road from the Tunisian border to the rebel-held town of Zintan . 
Haji Usama was once a top commander in Gadhafi 's forces He now commands in Zintan for the rebels He gives his account of major offensive in rebel stronghold Zintan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Over the past two days , Moammar Gadhafi 's forces have unleashed their biggest attack yet against one of the mountainous rebel strongholds in western Libya , according to one of his former generals . 
Haji Usama , as he is known to the rebels , was once a top commander in Gadhafi 's forces . 
He spent decades in the Libyan army including a tour of duty in neighboring Chad , and now commands in Zintan , population 40,000 . 
Today , he hates that his former commander in chief regards him as a terrorist . 
Haji Usama says that early Thursday morning about 150 of Gadhafi 's infantry troops -- supported by about 40 vehicles , including long range `` Grad '' rocket launchers and heavy , long-range machine guns -- began an attack on three fronts near Zintan . 
Zintan sits about 90 miles southwest from the capital of Tripoli , and is at the eastern tip of a 170-mile long ribbon of rebel held mountains stretching westwards from the Tunisian border . 
Unexploded weapons hurting Misrata kids NATO strikes hit Libyan warships The trim , gray-bearded rebel commander says he 's never seen such an attack here before . 
Gadhafi `` has never used infantry like this '' -- normally he shells from a distance , he says . 
He says he took immediate action , dispatching what he called a brigade of men to cut off Gadhafi 's advance . 
A brigade he said consisted of `` hundreds of fighters , '' but he declined to give exact numbers . 
So far , the fighting has cost him dearly : one rebel killed and three injured , including one in critical condition . 
Deep , fresh trenches in the stark red sand here are testimony to the battle rebels say they are ready to fight should Gadhafi 's forces manage to break through . 
So far they have not and confidence among the rebels , if not high , is certainly up . 
Some of the fighters seen returning from the front lines crammed in the back of open top pickup trucks late Friday appeared remarkably young -- a few appeared to be school age . 
Among them , only a handful of weapons , a few hunting rifles and old bolt-action shot guns . 
Haji Usama admits many of his fighters are young , but he says `` they are keen and determined to fight for their freedom . '' 
He believe that Thursday 's attack was to regain control of the nearby town Rayayan . 
He says the east of Rayayan `` declared their support for the rebels a month ago . '' 
The rest of the town is loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security , Nasar al Mabout , whom Haji Usama claims lives there . 
Gadhafi 's forces simultaneously attacked on three fronts , to the north of Zintan firing Grad rockets at the east of Rayayna , and attacking to the southeast and to the east of Zintan , Haji Usama . 
In previous battles , Haji Usama says , Gadhafi 's artillery forces have taken over homes in Zuwail al Bagul and simply shelled from a distance . 
The latest attack is different . 
Since the raids began at dawn on Thursday , Haji Usama says he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayan with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling . 
As dusk fell Friday the shelling that could be clearly heard and seen from the roof tops of Zintan earlier abated before picking up with sporadic barrages of fire shortly before 10 p.m. . 
The rebels say the night-time shelling is simply to terrorize Zintan 's residents into fleeing . 
`` Some have , '' he says , but most are staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over .

2011-05-21,"Picture shows damages at the port of Tripoli on May 20 after NATO warplanes hit eight vessels . 
Four detained French citizens are released Libyan official says the airstrikes limit the flow of food and fuel into the country NATO says it struck Libyan warships that have been targeting humanitarian aid Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan officials sounded an alarm Saturday over NATO bombings of three ports that they said would trigger a crisis by limiting the movement of supply ships carrying critical supplies in and out of the war-torn nation . 
NATO jets destroyed eight Libyan warships in the ports of Tripoli , Al-Khums and Sirte after concluding that Col. Moammar Gadhafi had started using naval assets to lay mines and hamper international humanitarian aid , said Mike Bracken , NATO 's military spokesman . 
Libyan officials said , however , that the airstrikes violated the United Nations resolution mandating the protection of civilians . 
Amran al-Forjani , Libya 's chief coastguard commandant , called the operation a `` crazy attack . '' 
No deaths or injuries were reported . 
Bracken said at a Friday news conference that the NATO strikes were justified . 
Battle in Libya rages on Libya troops using rape as a weapon ? 
Libya 's al-Obeidy : ` My soul is liberated ' NATO strikes hit Libyan warships Gadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid , Bracken said . 
`` He was using maritime forces to lay mines . 
These were legal targets , '' he said . 
NATO warplanes have been pounding military targets since March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution to protect civilians by any means necessary as Gadhafi 's forces try to quash a nearly three-month revolt against Gadhafi 's nearly 42 years of rule . 
NATO and human rights groups said Libyan forces have targeted aid ships coming in and out of Misrata , where a bloody see-saw battle has raged between Gadhafi 's forces and the rebels . 
But the coast guard commandant denied that his vessels were used to attack Misrata or any other Libyan city . 
A Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area Friday said the commercial port , not the nearby military port , was hit . 
From the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area , it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit . 
Six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel in dock for maintenance , said Mohammed Ahmed Rashed , the port general manager . 
The port remained operational , according to officials , but the strikes would impact the limited movement of supply ships . 
Libyan officials said the port is the main food and fuel supply line , and they expect the strikes to deter freight ships from coming because of security concerns and to increase the insurance on ships and goods . 
In another development , the European Union will open an office in Benghazi on Sunday , officials said . 
Catherine Ashton , foreign policy chief of the European Union , will open the office , said the National Transitional Council , which is based in the city . 
The council , in a statement , quoted Ashton as saying , `` It will be an honor to meet the people who have been fighting for democracy and a better future for Libya . 
I plan to meet key people from the National Transitional Council , civil society groups and our international partners , and will report back to EU Foreign Ministers on Monday . 
Opening an EU office is an important signal of our unfaltering support for the Libyan people . 
It is the EU putting words into action . '' 
Also Saturday , Libyan rebels released four French nationals detained in Benghazi since May 11 . 
The four traveled to Egypt on Saturday , where they were taken in by French consular authorities , the French Foreign Ministry said . 
And in western Libya , a government bus carrying three foreigners working for international media organizations -- Phoenix TV , BBC and Reuters -- was attacked by an angry mob in Zawiya . 
The journalists were on their way to the Tunisian border . 
Yijun Zhou , a reporter for Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV , said an angry crowd of dozens surrounded the bus and a man with a knife slashed the tires of the bus , kicked in the doors and climbed aboard followed by five more men . 
Reuters producer Guy Desmond , who was also on the bus , said at least two of the attackers had pistols and one had a knife . 
They shouted at the journalists , demanding to know their nationalities and employers . 
The journalists were taken to a police station for two hours before they returned to Tripoli to get another bus back to the border . 
Meanwhile , pro-Gadhafi forces have unleashed their biggest attack yet against a rebel stronghold in the mountains of western Libya , one of the Libyan leader 's former generals said . 
As of Friday night , one rebel was dead and three were wounded , one of them critically , the former commander said . 
He now commands rebels in Zintan , using the name Hajj Usama . 
The attack began Thursday when about 150 of Gadhafi 's infantry troops began firing on three fronts near Zintan , about 90 miles southwest of the capital , Tripoli . 
In response , Usama said he dispatched hundreds of fighters to cut off Gadhafi 's advance .

Rebels in Zintan , in western Libya , said they believe the explosions were from Grad rockets . 
It was not immediately clear whether any damage or casualties resulted . 
Meanwhile , Catherine Ashton , foreign policy chief for the European Union , arrived Sunday in the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi , according to military sources in the opposition 's National Transitional Council . 
Officials earlier said the European Union would open an office in Benghazi on Sunday . 
`` It will be an honor to meet the people who have been fighting for democracy and a better future for Libya , '' Ashton said in a statement released by the council . 
`` I plan to meet key people from the National Transitional Council , civil society groups and our international partners , and will report back to EU foreign ministers on Monday . 
Unexploded weapons hurting Misrata kids `` Opening an EU office is an important signal of our unfaltering support for the Libyan people , '' Ashton said . 
`` It is the EU putting words into action . '' 
Ashton told reporters she has met with council leaders , members of the media , young people and representatives from women 's groups and human rights organizations . 
`` I come with three messages , '' she said . 
`` The first is to echo again that -LRB- longtime Libyan leader Moammar -RRB- Gadhafi must leave , and we must have a future for Libya that belongs to the people of Libya and moves forward as they wish . '' 
Secondly , by opening an EU office in Benghazi , `` I bring the commitment of the EU 27 member-states and all of the institutions in support of the people of Benghazi and the people of Libya , for us to support you in the future that you wish to see for your country , '' she said . 
`` And thirdly , to say that we do n't just come for today , but that we 're here for the long term -- that what the EU can offer is support as you build the country of the future , your institutions , your economy , your political life . 
We will be here to support you every step of the way . '' 
NATO warplanes have been pounding military targets since March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution to protect civilians by any means necessary as Gadhafi 's forces try to quash a nearly three-month revolt against Gadhafi 's nearly 42 years of rule . 
Asked whether the office 's opening means the EU will encourage member-states to recognize the National Transitional Council as Libya 's new government , Ashton told CNN 's Sara Sidner the subject did not come up during talks , and that it remains up to individual member-states to recognize the new government or not . 
Protecting civilians , she told reporters , is `` fundamental . 
Too many people have died already . '' 
`` It will be very important , '' she told CNN , `` to safeguard what all this is about , which is human rights and fundamental freedoms . '' 
Members of women 's groups , she said , are anxious that women be fully represented in the process of building a new government . 
Rebels on the front lines near Libya 's border with Tunisia , where a narrow finger of land controlled by rebels has become a vital supply route for the opposition , talked with CNN 's Nic Robertson on Saturday . 
The area is under continued shelling by Gadhafi 's forces , who are trying to close the route . 
`` Today is going hard , '' said one rebel fighter . 
He said he has lost his brother and others in the fighting , adding that he does n't worry about himself as being martyred is honorable . 
He showed his gun , held together by pieces of tape . 
Late Saturday , former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney decried U.S. policy on Libyan state television , saying the `` last thing we need to do is spend money on death , destruction and war . '' 
State television is fiercely loyal to Gadhafi , and McKinney 's interview was spliced with footage of what appeared to be pro-Gadhafi rallies . 
`` I think that it 's very important that people understand what is happening here , '' McKinney said in the interview . 
`` And it 's important that people all over the world see the truth . 
And that is why I am here ... to understand the truth . '' 
She said she was invited to Libya by the `` nongovernmental organization for fact-finding , '' adding that she intends to bring more people to the country soon so that `` they too can understand . '' 
Gadhafi 's government has repeatedly urged the international community to send fact-finding teams to Libya to report what 's happening on the ground . 
At one point during the interview , state TV cut to what it said were live airstrikes , hitting Gadhafi 's compound . 
`` Is that a bomb ? '' 
`` I want to say categorically and very clearly that these policies of war ... are not what the people of the United States stand for and it 's not what African-Americans stand for , '' she told state TV . 
The former Georgia representative also slammed the economic policies of U.S. President Barack Obama and said the government of the United States no longer represents the interests of the American people . 
`` Under the economic policies of the Obama administration , those who have the least are losing the most . 
And those who have the most are getting even more , '' she said . 
`` The situation in the United States is becoming more dire for average ordinary Americans and the last thing we need to do is to spend money on death , destruction and war . '' 
Separately , McKinney appeared on state-run Press TV this week in Iran . 
She was reported to be in Tehran attending the International Conference on Global Alliance Against Terrorism for a Just Peace .

2011-05-24,"Sergey Lavrov -LRB- pictured -RRB- was speaking after a meeting with Libyan opposition spokesman Abdel Rahman Shalgam . 
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov meets with a Libyan opposition representative The opposition knows it will be one of several parties in talks , he says Lavrov hopes a strategy will be worked out `` that will help end this bloodshed '' Moscow -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Libyan opposition is not asking to be recognized as the `` sole legitimate '' authority in the country , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday , a day after meeting with opposition representative Abdel Rahman Shalgam . 
Instead , he said , Shalgam asked only that the National Transitional Council , based in Benghazi , Libya , be considered `` as a legitimate partner in the talks '' aimed at settling the nation 's conflict , Lavrov said . 
Opposition officials are aware , Lavrov said , that the settlement talks should also involve other parties , including representatives of Tripoli and western regions of Libya . 
Lavrov said he hopes a crisis settlement plan for Libya can be formulated at an upcoming session of the African Union . 
`` I hope that some strategy will be worked out based on all of these approaches '' -- referring to ones offered by opposition representatives in Benghazi , the African Union and the United Nations -- `` that will help end this bloodshed as soon as possible , '' he said . 
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Lavrov , Shalgam said Monday that the Libyan opposition would like to continue dialog with the Russian authorities `` because Russia is a very important state and a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council . '' 
`` We have agreed to remain in contact over the situation in Libya , '' he said . 
Shalgam reiterated that the Libyan opposition is not going to strike any reconciliation deal with the country 's ruling government , and insisted on the immediate resignation of leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
`` We will have peace and no gunfire when Gadhafi relinquishes power or leaves the country , '' he said . 
Shalgam also said the Libyan opposition does not want NATO to conduct a ground operation in Libya . 
Last week , Lavrov also held separate talks in Moscow with an envoy of the Libyan government , the secretary general of the World Islamic Call Society , Muhammad Ahmed al-Sharif , as well as U.N. Special Envoy for Libya Abdul Ilah Khatib .

2011-05-24,"By the CNN Wire Staff Compound for pro-Gadhafi volunteers was targeted It is one of the heaviest NATO attacks on Tripoli so far France to use attack helicopters , official says ; reports say UK also plans to The EU 's foreign policy chief pledges support to Libyan rebel government Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO aircraft launched more than a dozen strikes on the Libyan capital early Tuesday , and smoke could be seen rising from the area near Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's Bab-al-Azizia compound in Tripoli . 
The NATO attack , one of the heaviest against Tripoli since the NATO mission began just over two months ago , started at about 1 a.m. and lasted more than 20 minutes , with alliance jets circling overhead and Libyan loyalist forces responding with anti-aircraft fire . 
Moussa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , said the attack targeted a guard compound for pro-Gadhafi military volunteers that had been emptied in anticipation . 
At least three people were killed and 150 wounded , Ibrahim said , calling the attack an escalation by NATO . 
Reporters felt and heard explosions from the airstrike that rocked the hotel housing members of the international media . 
Outbursts of gunfire , as well as ambulance sirens , could be heard in the streets . 
The facility resupplies government forces that have been attacking Libyan civilians , according to the NATO statement . 
Gadhafi 's forces `` still represent a threat to civilians and we will continue to strike targets that carry out this violence , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard of Canada , who commands the Libya operation . 
Journalists later visited a hospital where they reported they saw the bodies of three men , at least two covered in dust , and a number of injured people . 
CNN did not go on the hospital visit because of safety concerns . 
On Monday , forces loyal to Gadhafi attacked a rebel-held border crossing into Tunisia in a battle that resulted in nine deaths , according to the rebels ' military commander in Zintan , Hajj Osama . 
He said Gadhafi infantry who attacked rebels controlling the border post suffered eight fatalities ; one rebel fighter was killed . 
Food and fuel are shipped into Libya and wounded rebels are taken out for medical treatment via the crossing , which is literally a lifeline to the rebels , the rebel commander said . 
Since they were driven from the border checkposts by rebels more than two weeks ago , Gadhafi 's troops have been shelling the rebels ' nearby mountaintop holdouts to try to regain control of this vital artery . 
In the towns of Yefren and Algalaa , southwest of Tripoli , only about 1,000 residents remained of the usual population of 22,000 , said a local person who is in touch with rebels there . 
The military commander in Zintan , near the border with Tunisia , corroborated those numbers . 
They contrast with figures issued by the Libyan Committee for Humanitarian aid and Relief , which said 22,000 to 25,000 people remained trapped in the two towns , and that about 40,000 others had been displaced to other towns in the Nafusa Mountains , Tripoli and Tunisia . 
For the past two months , the towns ' dwindling numbers of residents have been enduring spartan living conditions -- without electricity or fuel and with only limited access to water , since Gadhafi forces control the region 's water wells and have contaminated some of them with oil , the committee said . 
Banks in Yefren and Algalaa have been closed since February 17 , which has led to a widespread shortage of cash , it added . 
The cities ' main water tank has been out of commission since it was damaged six weeks ago by missiles and no food supplies have entered the area since March 1 , it said . 
Snipers loyal to Gadhafi control access to the hospital in Yefren and most doctors have fled , it added . 
In other NATO efforts against Gadhafi forces Monday , an airstrike hit a Libyan army position outside the rebel town of Jadu in the western mountains , rebels in Zintan told CNN . 
The attack took place around noon -LRB- 6 a.m. ET -RRB- , shortly after the Gadhafi forces at that position had launched Grad rockets into the rebel-held town , rebels said . 
NATO reported Monday that since its operation began on March 31 , it has flown 7,870 sorties , including 3,025 strike sorties , which are intended to identify and engage targets , but do not necessarily deploy munitions . 
On Sunday , a command-and-control center was hit near Tripoli and a missile support facility was struck near Al Khums , NATO said in a news release . 
Near Sirte , an ammunition storage facility was struck and , near Brega , a command-and-control facility was targeted , it said . 
A spokesman for France 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said France plans to add attack helicopters to the country 's arsenal in Libya , saying the aircraft would make `` more precise '' strikes possible . 
Media reports said Britain also plans to use attack helicopters . 
A spokesman for Britain 's Ministry of Defense said only that , `` As with any military campaign , we are constantly reviewing our options alongside allies to enhance the capabilities available to NATO . '' 
Nearly 600 migrants and wounded civilians arrived Monday afternoon in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi aboard a boat from the embattled city of Misrata , said the International Organization for Migration , which chartered the vessel . 
The boat 's arrival marked the seventh such mission carried out by the group since mid-April . 
The boat 's passengers included nearly 400 people from Niger as well as migrants from Nigeria , Chad , Sudan , Pakistan , Egypt , Bangladesh , Tunisia and seven Palestinians . 
The boat had arrived Saturday in Misrata carrying 280 tons of food aid and a field hospital . 
The developments came as the International Committee of the Red Cross appealed to donors for an additional $ 53 million `` to help the organization meet the urgent needs of people affected by the fighting in Libya . '' 
`` As long as the conflict in Libya continues , the outlook for the coming months is dire , and living conditions may further deteriorate for a large percentage of the population , '' said Boris Michel , ICRC head of operations for North and West Africa . 
The Council of the European Union reiterated its call Monday for the protection of civilians , a cease-fire and identifying Gadhafi as `` a threat to the Libyan people . '' 
Catherine Ashton , the European Union 's foreign policy chief , was to detail on Monday meetings with Libya 's rebel leaders a day after opening an office in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
Ashton was to brief the EU 's foreign ministers about weekend meetings where she pledged support from the 27-nation union to the chairman of Libya 's Transitional National Council . 
`` I am here today to explain and be clear about the depth and breadth of our support in the European Union for the people of Libya , '' Ashton said in a statement Sunday by the EU shortly after her meeting with Mustafa Abdul Jalil , the transitional council chairman . 
During the meeting , Ashton said she and Jalil discussed security reform , border management , the economy and civil society . 
Arrest warrants have been issued by the International criminal Court for Gadhafi and two relatives , linking them to `` widespread and systematic '' attacks on civilians as they struggle to retain power in Libya . 
The court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , has said that the court in The Hague will investigate allegations of institutionalized rape in the war-torn country . 
A Libyan government official told CNN that Gadhafi 's government welcomes the court 's investigation but said that prosecutors `` have not been to Libya to do an investigation . '' 
Siham Sergewa , a Libyan psychologist , has been collecting reports of women reportedly raped and beaten by Gadhafi ` sforces that she says she is sharing with the criminal court . 
Sergewa told CNN 's Sara Sidner that she began collecting the reports after receiving a call from the mother of a patient in Ajdabiya , a town in eastern Libya that was the scene of some of the earliest fighting between rebels and government forces . 
The mother told Sergewa that she had been abducted by three or four men and taken to the desert where she was raped . 
Since then , Sergewa told CNN she has collected surveys from more than 270 women at refugee camps along Libya 's borders with Egypt and Tunisia who allege they were assaulted by Gadhafi forces .

2011-05-25,"By the CNN Wire Staff Smoke billows behind the trees following an air raid on Tajura , about 30 kilometers -LRB- 18.6 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli on Tuesday . 
NEW : Some residents of Yefren are said to be living in caves Libyan government official accuses NATO of striking a secondary school Woman says she waited three days on line for gas Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Explosions erupted in Tripoli for a second consecutive night Wednesday into Thursday morning as NATO jets struck a vocational secondary school , a Libyan government official said . 
`` We 're not in a position to independently confirm that allegation , '' a NATO official said . 
The attacks got under way hours after a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged that the United States is providing munitions for allies to use in the air campaign against Libya . 
`` We have provided material support , including munitions , to allies and partners engaged in operations in Libya , '' Col. Dave Lapan said in a statement . 
But , as President Barack Obama warned Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday that there would be `` no letup '' in NATO airstrikes , Russia lashed out against the air campaign , calling the bombing of certain Tripoli targets a `` flagrant deviation '' from the United Nations mandate . 
World leaders urge patience in Libya Children seek shelter in Libya 's caves Damaged wells could push out rebels Gadhafi missiles litter rebel town The U.N. chief said the special U.N. envoy for Libya , who has been in Benghazi meeting with the Libyan opposition , would return soon to Tripoli to try to secure an agreement . 
The war has dragged on for more than two months , with reports of horrific fighting and civilian casualties . 
The Russian Foreign Ministry alleged Wednesday that several `` non-military facilities in Tripoli that had already been bombed , were again attacked in a massive NATO airstrike , leading to civilian casualties . '' 
It said in a written statement that `` this is yet another flagrant deviation '' from the U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 . 
That resolution authorized all means necessary , short of occupying forces , to enforce a no-fly zone and protect Libyan civilians from attacks by forces loyal to Gadhafi . 
A barrage of at least 18 rockets struck Tripoli Tuesday , killing 19 people and wounding another 150 in the heaviest onslaught since NATO 's aerial strikes began , a government official told CNN . 
NATO said it had struck a government vehicle storage facility adjacent to Gadhafi 's compound . 
The Russian ministry said NATO has justified its attacks by citing the need to protect civilians but said that it was `` impossible to deny the obvious fact that airstrikes are not stopping military confrontation between the warring Libyan sides , and are only causing additional suffering of peaceful Libyans . '' 
It said the airstrikes are failing to end the Libyan conflict , which was triggered by protests in February and an ensuing crackdown by Gadhafi 's forces . 
Russia , which has been critical of the airstrikes all along , has said normalization in Libya can come only from an immediate halt in military activities , the ministry said . 
Some have viewed the Libya campaign as a litmus test for relations between the alliance and Russia . 
The 28 members of NATO work with Russia as equal partners in the NATO-Russia Council , a group that works on a wide array of issues , including security . 
Obama , who met Wednesday in London with his British counterpart , David Cameron , increased pressure on Gadhafi by repeating that , ultimately , the embattled strongman must go . 
The mission to protect Libyans from their leader means making sure Gadhafi `` does n't have capacity to send in a bunch of thugs to murder innocent civilians and threaten them , '' Obama said . 
`` I do think we have made enormous progress in Libya . 
We have saved lives . 
Gadhafi and his regime need to understand there will not be a letup in the pressure we are applying , '' Obama said . 
But he and Cameron said it will take time to reach a solution in the North African country , ruled with an iron fist by Gadhafi for 42 years . 
`` We may have to be more patient than people would like , '' Obama said of the apparent stalemate . 
In an effort to break the monthslong standoff , South Africa President Jacob Zuma plans to visit Tripoli next week for talks with Gadhafi , according to a statement on the South African leader 's website . 
Zuma will meet Gadhafi Monday in `` his capacity as a member of the African Union high-level panel for the resolution of the conflict in Libya , '' the statement said . 
The panel also includes Uganda and Mauritania . 
It is the second such trip for Zuma , who was part of an African Union delegation that visited the nation last month . 
That visit , which included talks on a cease-fire , did not succeed . 
The Libyan government lashed out Wednesday at Obama and Cameron . 
`` It is illegal and illegitimate to speak about regime change under the pretext of protecting civilians , '' said a government official . 
`` It is up to the Libyan people to decide when and if Colonel Gadhafi should go -- not the U.S. and the U.K. '' Russia 's official RIA Novosti news agency reported that Gadhafi 's government may ask Moscow to mediate the conflict . 
Meanwhile , in Tripoli , daily life has become more onerous . 
One woman said Wednesday that she had waited more than three days on line to get a half-tank of fuel for her car . 
The woman said that , while waiting in the line on Tuesday night , she saw a man a few cars ahead of her reach the fuel pump and present his number to a police officer , who rejected it as fraudulent . 
When the man protested , the police officer fatally shot him , she said . 
Witnesses torched a police car in retaliation , she said . 
Life outside the capital also appears precarious . 
The same woman said about three dozen Gadhafi soldiers on Saturday broke into her family 's farm near Zwara -- just east of the Tunisian border -- and moved in . 
One of the soldiers told the farm caretaker they were taking over civilian properties to use as command posts and weapons storehouses because they feared being attacked by NATO if they were to use military facilities , said the woman , who asked not to be identified because she fears reprisal . 
A number of residents of the city of Yefren , about two hours southwest of Tripoli , had taken up residence in caves in order to avoid pro-Gadhafi forces , said an elderly man who cited safety concerns in declining to be identified . 
Nearby residents avoid seeking help from Yefren 's hospital , he said . 
`` Any injured person who tries to enter the hospital is detained by the brigades , '' he said . 
`` We try to treat our wounded and give them first aid and protect them inside the mountain so they wo n't be killed or kidnapped by Gadhafi 's brigades . ''

The visit is in the planning stages and will be aimed at discussing ways for Gaddafi to exit , Talk Radio 702 said , citing sources in Tripoli . 
Zuma 's spokesman was not immediately available for comment .

French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Tuesday that the NATO bombing campaign was making progress and should achieve its objectives within months . 
France , Britain and the United States are leading the air strikes , which started on March 19 after the United Nations Security Council authorised `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces as he sought to crush an uprising . 
Talk Radio 702 said Zuma will visit Libya after attending the inauguration of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan on May 29 . 
The South African president headed an African Union mission to Tripoli in April but the AU bid to halt the civil war collapsed within hours .

Johannesburg-based Talk Radio 702 earlier reported that the aim of the visit was to discuss an exit strategy for Gaddafi but the presidency statement made no mention of that . 
`` President Zuma will stop over in Tripoli for a discussion with Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , on the 30th of May , in his capacity as a member of the African Union High Level Panel for the Resolution of the conflict in Libya , '' the statement said . 
The South African president headed an African Union mission to Tripoli in April but the AU bid to halt the civil war collapsed within hours . 
A South African government official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the aim of the latest effort from the African Union was `` to seek a breakthrough . '' 
France and the United States have made upbeat assessments on progress towards ending Gaddafi 's 41-year rule .

2011-05-26,"Libyan students in America hurt by freeze on Gadhafi 's assets May 26 , 2011 | By Reema Khrais , CNN Naji Abdelwanis and his family are in limbo now that LIbyan assets used to cover U.S. scholarships have been frozen . 
Naji Abdelwanis had a plan : study hard , earn a degree in the United States and return to his country to build a better Libya . 
The 45-year-old from Benghazi never doubted that he would complete his degree . 
He has already finished two years at Clemson University with high marks . 
But now , with Libya in turmoil and its government 's assets frozen overseas , his dream is in disarray . 
Abdelwanis , who is earning a doctorate in industrial engineering , is one of about 2,000 Libyans studying in the United States . 
They are dependent on scholarships provided by the regime of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
But with about $ 30 billion of the government 's assets frozen by the U.S. government , Libya is now unable to cover all of the tuition , living expenses and health insurance costs of the students and their families . 
The money , which is administered by a Canadian non-profit group , will run out on May 31 . 
This leaves students like Abdelwanis -- especially those with families -- nervous about how they will keep a roof over their heads . 
Abdelwanis has five other family members to feed . 
And his options do n't look promising . 
`` They are n't giving us any visible solution , '' he said . 
`` I ca n't work with a student visa . 
I ca n't return because it is too unsafe . 
I do n't even have enough money to buy a ticket . '' 
The Canadian Bureau for International Education , which distributes the funds in the United States and Canada , is worried that the students will lose their status and possibly their right to live in North America . 
It is urgently looking for different avenues to secure money . 
`` I think that everybody realizes that the students are innocent victims of circumstances way beyond their control , '' said CBIE Vice President Jennifer Humphries . 
`` It is not appropriate in any way to have them distressed or potentially in any danger because we can not find mechanisms to provide support to them . '' 
CBIE manages the Libyan-North American Scholarship Program with the Libyan Ministry of Education and Scientific Research . 
While some 2,500 Libyan students pursue graduate and post-graduate medical studies through the program , Humphries said , close to 4,000 Libyans , including family members , are dependent on it . 
In February , as Libya sank into civil war , the U.S. Treasury Department froze many of the Libyan government 's assets held in America . 
CBIE later received permission from the Treasury to distribute funds it already had for the current academic year , but had trouble accessing any new money .

Full Article US firm buys `` mystery '' cargo of Libyan rebel oil NEW YORK | Thu May 26 , 2011 6:17 am IST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. refiner Tesoro has bought the first oil cargo sold by rebels who control eastern Libya , a deal that could help them drum up funds to fight Muammar Gaddafi . 
San Antonio-based Tesoro told Reuters on Wednesday it bought the Libyan rebel crude to process in its Hawaii refinery . 
The deal was first agreed upon in late April , company spokesman Mike Marcy said . 
`` We purchased a cargo of Libyan crude that was available at the time , '' he said in an email . 
Swiss oil trading firm Vitol SA , which loaded the crude onto a tanker in Libya in early April , acted as middleman in the transaction , trading sources said . 
While Vitol marketed the crude , Tesoro 's purchase of the cargo marks the first transaction involving Libya 's eastern rebels -- fighting with NATO 's backing to topple Muammar Gaddafi -- and a major foreign commercial user of oil . 
`` It 's an important precedent because it proves the rebels can find international buyers for their oil , '' a source at a major oil tanker operator told Reuters , requesting anonymity . 
That could help pave the way for more Libyan oil sales . 
Rebels , who need funds to continue their fight against Gaddafi , want to sell more oil from the chunk of Libyan territory they control . 
But due to the country 's civil war , Libyan oilfield production has fallen to a small fraction of its normal 1.6 million barrels per day . 
Potential buyers of eastern Libyan crude have also worried that international sanctions against doing business with Libyan firms make any transaction risky , traders and shippers said . 
The Liberian-flagged tanker , called Equator , is laden with a million barrels of light Libyan crude worth around $ 100 million , and is scheduled to arrive in Honolulu around June 7 , according to Reuters tanker tracking data . 
Tesoro told Reuters that the Libyan crude cargo is not subject to sanctions . 
`` This purchase was made in strict accordance with the relevant White House Executive Order , signed by President Obama , '' Marcy wrote in an email . 
In late February , the U.S. government pronounced it legal to do business with the rebel-controlled oil firm Agoco , which usually produces around 400,000 barrels a day . 
The firm had been part of the Gaddafi-controlled National Oil Corp until it fell under rebel control . 
The tanker cargo had been floating idle near Singapore since late April , GPS data shows . 
The Tesoro deal lays to rest a mystery that has surrounded its eventual destination and buyer , which have been subject to speculation among shipbrokers and oil traders . 
`` There has been a lot of secrecy , '' a U.S.-based oil trader said . 
`` Everyone wanted to know where the cargo was headed , but it was hard to track . '' 
Vitol declined to comment on why the cargo was delayed , and did not reveal its buyer . 
While the U.S. government executive order exempts rebel crude cargoes from sanctions , the United Nations and the European Union have also placed sanctions on Libya , and some legal experts say that buying oil from eastern Libyan may still entail risks . 
Reuters wrote a special report about the Libyan crude cargo on May 16 . 
At that time , several sources said it appeared the cargo was in legal limbo , with oil companies weighing the potential risks of buying it .

2011-05-27,"Libyan rebels launch online radio station mixing music and news from the frontline Tribute FM is staffed by volunteers some of whom suffered under Libyan regime Station broadcast from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi is getting international listenership DJ : I believe we are we are in the frontline but with a voice , not with a gun Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a room padded with foam and spray-painted with graffiti , the new sounds of rebellion in Libya are being broadcast online . 
The guys running Tribute FM are amateurs who dug into their own pockets to fund Libya 's first English-language online broadcaster targeting a worldwide audience . 
So far it has received a few e-mails and Skype calls from listeners from as far away as Denmark , the United States and Italy . 
`` It is a people 's movement right , but started by youth and powered by youth , OK , '' one of the DJs says into his mike as the show begins . 
He wants to be heard , not seen or identified by name because , he says , it will put his family at risk . 
They still live in areas controlled by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
He , meanwhile , is in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and using his microphone as a weapon against the regime . 
`` This is our gift to all martyrs , to the people who actually died and suffered throughout this revolution , '' explains his colleague Aiman , who also asks that only his first name be used . 
Rebel airstrip awaits NATO go ahead They are both Libyans who recently returned to the North African country from Britain . 
They have teamed with two of their countrymen in Benghazi and they 're all looking to play a part in the history of their country -- a country they hope is in the midst of major change . 
`` We had 42 years of suffering , '' Aiman says . 
`` We want to show the people that this regime hurt Libya very much . 
Hopefully it will be over very soon . 
We just want to prove to the world that Gadhafi is no longer wanted in this land . '' 
The station format swings wildly from news and information to all kinds of music , from hardcore revolutionary rap to ballads . 
The show begins with the sounds of Bob Marley 's `` Redemption Song '' and its chorus : `` Redemption song\/These songs of Freedom , songs of freedom . '' 
Then the team starts a talk segment , joking about how their co-founder had been sleeping while their website was hacked and knocked offline . 
They have no proof but they suspect it was an effort by the government because they have already been talked about on government-run TV . 
`` They actually did mention us four or five times on the state -LRB- TV -RRB- , '' says Aiman . 
`` They said we 've been brought up by foreign countries to spread Christianity . '' 
The station founders dismiss this as a ridiculous allegation : yes , they are trying to spread a message , but it is not about religion , it 's about revolution , they say . 
Even the language choice is a slap at Gadhafi 's regime : from 1986 to 1997 the government banned the teaching of English in Libya . 
The team is on air from 8 p.m. to about 4 a.m. local time . 
They want to be able to broadcast for as long as possible , so they are recruiting and auditioning volunteers . 
Applicants have to be able to speak English if they want to be an announcer : many can because they have lived abroad . 
`` My dad , a couple of years ago , he wrote an article criticizing Gadhafi 's regime , '' recalls Hamida Baja . 
`` You know , here you are not allowed to do that so we were targeted . 
Moammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- saw the article and he was n't too happy about it . '' 
She and her family fled in fear . 
Her brothers still live abroad . 
`` I also fear that he might kill my dad or he might come threaten me and my mom . '' 
Baja is willing to help out at the station in any way that she can . 
She says it is also a venue that can give women a voice . 
`` It 's a new beginning . 
We can say how we feel and what we feel whenever we like . 
We should n't be afraid because we have certain opinions . '' 
But Tribute FM is not immune to criticism from its listeners . 
It found itself facing a clash of cultures when it played rap music from the west , complete with curse words . 
`` We apologized to our listeners , '' Aiman says . 
`` We try to keep with the culture and our tradition . 
We try to keep everything here very clean , very moderate . '' 
But what they wo n't apologize for is slamming the Gadhafi regime at will . 
`` I believe we are in the frontline but with a voice , not with a gun , '' Aiman says .

2011-05-27,"By the CNN Wire Staff U.S. provides arms in Libya Russian President Medvedev says Libya 's Gadhafi needs to step aside Russia has strongly criticized the NATO-led campaign in Libya Western leaders and Libya 's prime minister have asked Medvedev to mediate Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has joined American and other European leaders in calling for Moammar Gadhafi to step down from power , a shift that appears to indicate a closing diplomatic window for the longtime Libyan strongman . 
Moscow has been a strong critic of the NATO-led mission in Libya , arguing that the scope of the organization 's air campaign against Gadhafi 's forces far exceeds the civilian protection mandate approved by the U.N. Security Council . 
Medvedev 's call for Gadhafi to step aside came at the end of the Group of Eight summit in Deauville , France , on Friday . 
The G8 includes the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Canada , Japan , Germany , Italy and Russia . 
The G8 leaders also issued a written statement Friday expressing support for the democratic uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa . 
The summit leaders agree that `` the regime of Gadhafi has lost its legitimacy and he must leave , '' Medvedev said , according to Russia 's state-run RIA Novosti news agency . 
`` This was decided unanimously . '' 
His statement came on the heels of a request from the other G8 leaders to have the Russian leader mediate a settlement . 
Earlier , Gadhafi 's government also called for a Russian mediation , a sign that the Libyan leader may be searching for a way to bring about an end to the months-long war . 
Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi asked for help in achieving a cease-fire and starting talks without preconditions , according to a statement posted late Thursday by the Russian Foreign Ministry . 
During that conversation , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Libya would have to comply with the Security Council mandate and stop any action that would cause harm to civilians , the statement said . 
On Wednesday , the Russian Foreign Ministry called NATO 's recent bombing of certain Tripoli targets a `` flagrant deviation '' from U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 . 
That resolution authorizes all means necessary , short of occupying forces , to enforce a no-fly zone and protect Libyan civilians from attacks by forces loyal to Gadhafi . 
Russia , a permanent member of the Security Council , abstained from the vote on the resolution . 
U.S. President Barack Obama , who had an extended private meeting with Medvedev while in France , insisted Friday that `` the U.N. mandate of civilian protection can not be accomplished when Gadhafi remains in Libya directing his forces in acts of aggression against the Libyan people . '' 
`` We are joined in resolve to finish the job , '' he declared . 
A spokesman for Libya 's transitional government said Gadhafi must leave before the opposition could consider negotiations or a cease-fire . 
`` There is no more room for him in or near Libya , '' said Jalal el-Gallal , a spokesman for the National Transitional Council . 
NATO member Spain said Thursday that Libya had sent a message to Madrid and other European capitals , listing `` a series of proposals that could lead to a cease-fire , '' but the allies have rebuffed earlier Libyan proposals for an end to the fighting . 
While Gadhafi has been unable to come to terms with NATO demands , there may also be a growing rift between the NATO allies and the Libyan rebels over the nature of a post-Gadhafi regime . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy indicated Thursday that any future Libyan government may include senior members of Gadhafi 's regime so long as those individuals do not have `` blood on their hands . '' 
El-Gallal responded to Sarkozy by declaring Friday that it `` is only up to the Libyan people '' to decide `` who will remain '' in government and who will not . 
Intense fighting , meanwhile , continued on the ground in Libya , with at least 10 people killed and over 40 injured during clashes that occurred Friday in Dafniya , outside the hotly contested coastal city of Misrata . 
NATO warplanes bombed the Tripoli area late Thursday , with a tribal site near the capital the target of the latest attacks , a Libyan official said . 
Five explosions , most large enough to shake buildings some distance away , struck Tripoli shortly before midnight . 
The Libyan official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the target was the tribal compound at Bab Al-Azizya , about 2 kilometers -LRB- 1.3 miles -RRB- from the center of Tripoli . 
CNN could not independently confirm the report . 
The site is a former military base now used to welcome tribal visitors to Tripoli , offering them guest houses during their stay , the official said . 
It has been used as a center for people volunteering to support Libyan authorities since the revolt against Gadhafi erupted in February . 
CNN 's Maxim Tkachenko , Amir Ahmed , Ben Wedeman and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .

2011-05-27,"A family walks through the rubble of Misrata on Thursday . 
Now that the siege is over , people feel safe enough to come out . 
Get up to speed on some recent developments in Libya and what the future might bring The humanitarian situation will likely worsen if the conflict drags on into the summer The rebels in Libya seemed to have finally taken control of Misrata -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three months after protests against Moammar Gadhafi began in Libya , the country seems to be grinding into a stalemated civil war . 
Get up to speed on some of the recent events in Libya , what options President Obama and U.S. allies might have and what the next few months may bring as CNN 's Tim Lister answers some frequently asked questions about the crisis : In the past week especially , President Obama has stepped up his call that Gadhafi must go . 
What options do Obama and the allies of the U.S. have moving forward ? 
On the military front , the war in Libya has evolved into one of attrition . 
The United States is not taking the lead in terms of bombing missions , but the Pentagon disclosed this week that it was supplying munition to NATO allies to help them carry out sorties . 
Those sorties are increasingly aimed at what NATO terms the regime 's command and control functions , and increasingly at targets in and around Tripoli -- in other words at the nerve-center of the Gadhafi regime . 
The tactic is similar to that which NATO used when it was trying to expel Serbian troops from Kosovo in 1999 . 
Its planes began bombing targets close to the heart of the Milosevic regime in Belgrade , but it took 11 weeks of sustained attacks before Yugoslavia -LRB- as it then was -RRB- sued for peace . 
Libya : Explain it to me In the past week , the UK and France have announced they will begin using Apache helicopters against Gadhafi 's forces . 
The helicopters will be based offshore and allow for swifter reaction against smaller targets . 
And at the G-8 summit British Prime Minister David Cameron insisted progress was being made . 
`` There are signs that the momentum against Gadhafi is really building , '' he said . 
`` So it 's right that we are ratcheting up the military , the economic and the political pressure on the Gadhafi regime . '' 
But no one among the coalition is under any illusions about the task at hand . 
For a start , there is the wear and tear on the already overstretched air assets of the European members of NATO spearheading the air war . 
In London this week , Obama said : `` Ultimately this is going to be a slow , steady process in which we 're able to wear down the regime forces and change the political calculations of the Gadhafi regime to the point where they finally realize that they 're not going to control this country . '' 
What impact will the upcoming Senate vote on a resolution to back U.S. military action in Libya have , if anything ? 
The resolution has been suggested as a way around the thorny issue of the War Powers Act , passed in 1973 at the height of the debate over Vietnam . 
The Act prohibits U.S. armed forces from being involved in military actions for more than 60 days without congressional authorization . 
That 60-day mark has been passed -LRB- it was May 20 -RRB- , but there has been no congressional approval . 
It 's not the first time . 
In 1999 , then-President Bill Clinton continued airstrikes in the former Yugoslavia past the 60-day deadline . 
Again , the rationale was that civilians -LRB- in Kosovo -RRB- were being protected . 
Last week President Obama wrote to congressional leaders urging support for the action against Libya but not suggesting his action depended upon their approval . 
`` I wish to express my support for the bipartisan resolution ... which would confirm that the Congress supports the U.S. mission in Libya , '' he wrote , `` and that both branches are united in their commitment to supporting the aspirations of the Libyan people for political reform and self-government . '' 
But there 's clearly disquiet in Congress over its lack of leverage on Libya . 
This week the House passed by a huge majority an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that would `` prevent funds from being used to deploy , establish or maintain a presence of members of the armed services or private security contractors on the ground in Libya . '' 
Next week Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , is expected to introduce a resolution calling for a full withdrawal from the Libyan action in accordance with the War Powers Act . 
Any amendments to the Defense Authorization bill would also have to be passed by the Senate . 
The Senate resolution on Libya currently planned would not be binding . 
Libya is calling on Russia to mediate a cease-fire . 
Why Russia and what will be Russia 's role moving forward ? 
Is it likely that Gadhafi is open to a cease-fire ? 
Russia 's stance on Libya has shifted . 
For the first time it is suggesting that Gadhafi should step down . 
Russia 's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by Russian media Friday as saying that Gadhafi had forfeited his legitimacy as Libyan leader . 
`` It 's necessary to find a formula for Gadhafi to leave , and such a step would help settle other issues , '' Ryabkov said . 
Russia also signed up to the G-8 summit declaration , which said Gadhafi `` has no future in a free , democratic Libya . 
He must go . '' 
Russia may have more leverage with the Libyan regime than some Western countries . 
It has not been involved in the military campaign and has actively criticized its execution as beyond the mandate of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 . 
It also has historic contacts with the Gadhafi regime , and was its chief arms supplier . 
Russian mediation would also be a way for Moscow to assert itself in an international crisis in which -- so far -- it has had little role . 
Libya seems open to Russian involvement . 
The Russian Foreign Ministry said late Thursday that Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi had asked for Moscow 's help in achieving a cease-fire and starting talks without preconditions . 
Mahmudi has also suggested that the regime is willing to talk with the rebel Transitional National Council . 
But there is no sign that the departure -- immediate or eventual -- of Gadhafi is on offer . 
`` The leader is in the heart of every Libyan . 
If he leaves , the entire Libyan people leave , '' said al-Mahmudi . 
At a news conference in Tripoli , al-Mahmudi said the offer was based on an existing African Union `` roadmap '' to resolve the conflict , which does not include any mention of Gaddafi 's own future . 
The rebels have demanded that Gadhafi and his family leave positions of power as a pre-condition to a settlement . 
The two sides are clearly far apart . 
Moammar Gadhafi has made few appearances since the April 30 NATO airstrike on a Gadhafi compound . 
Have there been any signs of cracks in the support for Gadhafi ? 
Gadhafi has been seen very rarely in recent weeks . 
In fact we are aware of just one appearance , at a hotel in Tripoli to meet tribal leaders on May 12 , an event that was broadcast on Libyan TV that day . 
That was two weeks after Libyan authorities said that his youngest son Saif al-Arab had been killed in an airstrike . 
It may be that NATO 's persistent attacks against the sprawling Gadhafi compound known as Bab el-Azizia have forced Gadhafi to move secretly between locations , even though NATO has said publicly it 's not targeting the Libyan leader . 
It is virtually impossible for outsiders to get a read on the regime 's inner circle , many of whom are family members . 
But none of those at the heart of the regime has publicly defected since the foreign minister . 
There have been plenty of rumors about defections -- almost since the NATO campaign began in mid-March -- but CNN correspondents with good contacts within the regime say they 've seen no signs of serious dissension . 
What is the status of the rebels and opposition movement ? 
How unified are they ? 
Which areas do they occupy ? 
Libyan enemies helping each other Keeping Gadhafi forces out of Misrata In recent weeks , the rebels have finally taken control of Libya 's third largest city , Misrata , helped by NATO attacks on Gadhafi forces that were shelling the center of the city and its port . 
There is still sporadic fighting around the city , which has seen some of the fiercest combat in Libya 's civil war . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported from Misrata on Friday that another 10 people were killed in shelling . 
All told , the UN World Health Organization estimates nearly 1,000 people have been killed in Misrata . 
The city is the closest to Tripoli that the rebels control , but is still 130 miles from the capital -- and the rebels are not yet able to resupply it unhindered . 
Further east , the rebels have consolidated their control of Ajdabiya and are unchallenged in their headquarters -- the city of Benghazi . 
But pro-Gadhafi units are still operating around the city of Brega , which appears to be under government control . 
Toward the western border with Tunisia , fighting has flared in the last few weeks as rebels have tried to open a second front . 
But these rebels are not necessarily affiliated with the Benghazi Transitional National Council . 
They are Berbers from the Nafusa mountains . 
They control the town of Zintan , but it continues to be shelled by pro-Gadhafi forces . 
The humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres said Friday it was pulling out of the town after intense rocket fire . 
CNN 's Nic Robertson reported from the mountains earlier this week . 
The towns of Yefren and Al Galaa , he reported , `` are at the eastern tip of a slender sliver of rebel-held territory extending 270 kilometers westwards to the Tunisian border . 
Both have been targeted by Gadhafi since they joined the rebellion three months ago . '' 
As with other areas , the fighting appears at times almost random and haphazard . 
This is not a conflict where troops are dug in along well-recognized front lines . 
As for the rebel leadership , it is united in one aim : removing Gadhafi . 
The Transitional National Council is made up of professionals such as doctors and lawyers and some tribal representatives . 
But there are other forces in Libya . 
One unknown is the strength of the Muslim Brotherhood or other Islamist groups , long driven underground by the regime . 
And in Libya -- as in Yemen -- tribes are a very important part of the political equation . 
There have been signs of tension within the rebels ' military leadership -- apparently more to do with personal rivalries than military strategy . 
One of the worst-case scenarios at the start of the NATO campaign was a stalemate and it seems to be at that point . 
What are some options for the NATO coalition under the current parameters ? 
Western officials sense that the tide is turning against Gadhafi , albeit slowly . 
That may have less to do with rebel operations than with the broader diplomatic landscape , the pressures on the inner circle through the Tripoli attacks , and the growing shortages that civilians in the capital and in other towns still held by pro-Gadhafi forces must endure . 
Earlier this week there were reports of people waiting as long as three days to get a half-tank of gasoline in Tripoli . 
What are some possible scenarios for the next few months ? 
It seems likely that in much of Libya -- if the conflict drags on -- the humanitarian situation will worsen . 
On Friday , Amnesty International published a report on the deteriorating situation in the mountains of western Libya , citing `` the growing difficulty of surviving on supplies smuggled in from Tunisia and the dangers of traveling to areas controlled by forces loyal to Colonel Gadhafi . '' 
The group Medecins Sans Frontieres says at least 30,000 Libyans are refugees in the Tunisian town of Tartouane . 
I traveled through the town two months ago , and it 's scarcely big enough to manage such an influx . 
There are chronic shortages of water , power and other basic necessities in mountainous areas of western Libya . 
The long-term economic implications of this war are tomorrow 's headache . 
In the east , Benghazi at least can receive supplies from outside , usually by sea . 
There have been reports of sporadic shortages , but nothing acute . 
There are no signs that the regime is about to fall apart . 
CNN has spoken to regime opponents in Tripoli in the recent past , but few are willing to challenge Gadhafi and none would dare speak publicly . 
That being said , life is clearly getting more difficult for Gadhafi 's inner circle . 
One Western diplomat made this analogy : `` It 's as if Gadhafi is on a desert island , and the tide -- slowly and sometimes even imperceptibly -- is gradually closing in , and his room for maneuver is shrinking . '' 
The rebels are beginning to receive military training and advice , and some equipment . 
But that wo n't change the military balance overnight . 
Ultimately , as President Obama put it in London this week : `` We may have to be more patient than people would like . ''

2011-05-28,"A compound belonging to embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was hit by explosions on Saturday morning . 
The head of Libya 's opposition government told reporters Saturday he welcomed a call Friday by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for Moammar Gadhafi to step down . 
Medvedev 's statement , echoing the stance of American and European leaders , appeared to indicate a closing diplomatic window for the longtime Libyan strongman . 
The chairman of the National Transitional Council , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , said he has offered amnesty to Gadhafi loyalists who defect before the demise of the regime , but reiterated that there will be `` no negotiation for any solution until Gadhafi 's departure . '' 
Once that happens , elections and a constitutional referendum will be held within a year , Jailil said in the opposition stronghold of Benghazi . 
In an interview with CNN , Jalil said the council had sold a shipment of oil to China for $ 160 million . 
The confirmation of the sale is expected to buttress the political and economic credibility of the fledgling rebel power . 
The leader said the movement has a `` financial crisis '' and is seeking loans from outside the country . 
The council is happy for political support , but will not ask Russia for arms or economic aid , Jalil said . 
The unrest in Libya has persisted for months as opposition members demand an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
Jalil marked the 100th day of the nation 's civil war . 
`` We see victories emerging at both national and international levels , '' he said . 
`` We should celebrate what our heroic sons have accomplished in Misrata and the Nafusa mountains , as well as applaud the wide international support for our revolution . '' 
Meanwhile , a series of morning explosions rocked the capital of Tripoli on Saturday , including blasts at a compound belonging to Gadhafi and one at a nearby tribal compound , a government official said . 
The official said one morning strike occurred on Bab bin Ghashir , a tribal compound near Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound , where the other strikes occurred . 
The official believed the strikes were NATO attacks . 
Morning strikes in Tripoli are rare . 
NATO confirmed one of the attacks -- a press officer said the strike on Bab bin Ghashir was timed to minimize civilian casualties . 
NATO said it targeted a vehicle storage area at Bab bin Ghashir . 
The tribal compound is used by people who volunteer as support forces for Libyan authorities . 
A decade ago , the site was used as a military station . 
NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of any means -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians from attack or the threat of attack . 
It has been conducting airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources . 
"
2011-05-29,"By the CNN Wire Staff Anti-Gadhafi rebels have taken control of several Libyan cities , including Misrata , Benghazi and Ajdabiya . 
NEW : South Africa 's president makes his second trip to Tripoli in recent weeks NEW : The aim is to stop hostilities and spur peace talks , an African Union official says The rebel leader says , `` We are in desperate need of money '' More than 25 rebels in Libya are wounded in an attack near rebel-held Misrata Dafniya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South African President Jacob Zuma is set to meet embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Monday , his second visit to Tripoli since unrest started roiling the North African country . 
Unlike many other world leaders and alliances , Zuma , his African National Congress party and the African Union -- which he will represent on his trip , and which Gadhafi himself once led -- have not called for the longtime Libyan leader to step down . 
In fact , it has criticized the NATO airstrikes targeting government forces . 
Noureddine Mezni , an African Union spokesman , said the mission is to call for the cessation of all hostilities , followed by peace talks between the warring parties . 
The continental organization has helped mediate such talks before , including ones in Kenya and Zimbabwe that left the ruling powers still in control . 
Zuma 's first visit to Tripoli in April was launched with similar intentions , but did not achieve its desired results . 
On Saturday , rebel leaders marked the 100th day of an uprising they say was launched over concerns about lack of freedom , democracy and other concerns related to Gadhafi 's 42-year rule . 
Its leader , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , told CNN on Saturday that his opposition movement is running out of money -- at the same time it has achieved key victories militarily and diplomatically , including Russia joining others in calling for Gadhafi 's exit . 
The chairman of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council did not suggest in an exclusive interview that the rebels would pull back in their fight against Gadhafi 's government . 
But he pleaded for more resources so that the effort -- which is being backed by many Western nations -- could be successful . 
`` We are in desperate need of money , '' said Jalil , a former justice minister under Gadhafi . 
`` We really need money . 
We are going through a financial crisis . '' 
The opposition movement 's stature has been bolstered by the sale of a shipment of oil to China for $ 160 million , Jalil said . 
Still , he said the financial situation remains precarious for now -- especially with rebels ' limited access to more oil . 
`` People are patient and have been able to manage their lives at minimal living standards , '' he said . 
`` The problem is the prices have gone up . '' 
Jalil 's forces , meanwhile , continued to fend off attacks Sunday near the rebel-held city of Misrata . 
Gadhafi 's forces fired mortars and guns in an apparent effort to break through a stalemated line west of the city , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported from the scene . 
Rebels returned fire , and while some pulled back to seek cover from the incoming artillery shells , others moved toward the front line near the town of Dafniya , about 35 kilometers -LRB- 22 miles -RRB- west of Misrata . 
More than 25 opposition fighters have been wounded in the battle so far , medics at a field hospital told CNN . 
They did not report any deaths , but fighters returning from the battle said two men had been killed . 
Ambulances continued bringing wounded in for treatment . 
Libya has been in the throes of a civil war for months , since Gadhafi dug in his heels against popular efforts to force him out of power as anti-government protests sweep the Arab world this year . 
NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of any means -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians from attack or the threat of attack . 
It has been conducting airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources . 
Russia has not come on board fully supporting those strikes . 
But on Friday , President Dmitry Medvedev changed Moscow 's position and called for Gadhafi to step down . 
Ragtag rebels holding down Zintan Medvedev 's statement , echoing the stance of American and European leaders , appeared to indicate a closing diplomatic window for the Libyan strongman . 
In his interview with CNN , Jalil applauded Russia 's move . 
He said rebels would n't seek arms or economic aid from Russia , adding the council only wanted political support and help in expediting International Monetary Fund loans . 
Most valuable , he said , would be moving Gadhafi 's government closer to a political solition `` so no more blood will be spilled . '' 
`` We know very well that the Russians have relations with Moammar Gadhafi 's regime , and perhaps these relations will be used in the benefit of the revolutionaries in terms of finding an exit strategy for Gadhafi , '' Jalil said . 
He reiterated that the transitional council will `` agree to any cease-fire that leads to removing Moammar Gadhafi . 
Anything short of that is unacceptable . '' 
Jalil said Saturday he has offered amnesty to Gadhafi loyalists who defect before the demise of the regime , but reiterated that there will be `` no negotiation for any solution until Gadhafi 's departure . '' 
Once that happens , elections and a constitutional referendum will be held within a year . 
Marking what he called the 100th day of the nation 's civil war on Saturday , the rebel leader voiced optimism even given the movement 's financial straits . 
`` We see victories emerging at both national and international levels , '' he said . 
`` We should celebrate what our heroic sons have accomplished in Misrata and the Nafusa mountains , as well as applaud the wide international support for our revolution . ''

2011-05-30,"By the CNN Wire Staff South African leader arrives in Libya NEW : Two large explosions are heard early Monday near Tripoli More than 100 Libyan soldiers defect , along with eight generals Gadhafi says bombing by NATO must come to an end , South African president says President Jacob Zuma meets with Gadhafi ; does n't say he will step down Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fresh explosions rang out early Tuesday near Tripoli , hours after South African President Jacob Zuma held talks with Moammar Gadhafi and signalled he was ready to accept an African Union plan for a cease-fire . 
Around 12:45 a.m. Tuesday , a pair of large blasts were heard about five minutes apart , as jets flew over the capital of Tripoli . 
A Libyan government official said the first strike hit Abu Sita , a former military turned construction site about 10 kilometers -LRB- 6 miles -RRB- from the city center . 
There was no immediate indication of where the second explosion occurred . 
Nor was there an immediate response from NATO , which has conducted regular strikes as part of its stated mission to halt Libyan leader Gadhafi 's forces from killing innocent civilians . 
Hours before the blasts , Zuma emerged from a meeting with the longtime Libyan strongman convinced that Gadhafi was ready for an end to hostilities , including such airstrikes and the ongoing fight with the Benghazi-based opposition movement . 
But he gave no indication that Gadhafi was prepared to step aside , as rebel leaders have insisted is their primary demand . 
Libya opposition : ` We really need money ' Ragtag rebels holding down Zintan `` Brother leader took the position today that he is ready to implement the decision of the AU -LRB- that -RRB- there must be a cease-fire , '' Zuma told a scrum of reporters on the tarmac at Tripoli 's Mitiga International Airport before boarding a jet . 
`` The view is that that must include -- bombing by NATO must also come to an end , '' he said in the news conference , which was broadcast on Libyan state television . 
Zuma added that Gadhafi said any cease-fire must apply to all parties , `` but also , he makes the point that : Let the Libyan people be given a chance to talk among themselves . 
And therefore , he 's ready to implement the road map of the AU . '' 
Unlike some other world leaders , Zuma has not called for the longtime Libyan leader to step down . 
Neither has Zuma 's African National Congress party nor the African Union , which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led . 
In fact , the AU has criticized the NATO airstrikes . 
In April , Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli , where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed , in principle , to the African Union 's `` road map '' proposal for peace . 
But Gadhafi continued his attacks and the Libyan opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years . 
A government official said Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi also attended Monday 's meeting . 
Baghdadi greeted Zuma upon his arrival at the airport , where dozens of Gadhafi supporters carried posters , some of which said , `` May the leader be victorious '' and `` Thanks for great Africa . '' 
The African Union has helped mediate peace talks before , including ones in Kenya and Zimbabwe that left the ruling powers in control . 
It was not clear whether Zuma used the opportunity to press Gadhafi for information on the whereabouts of South African freelance photographer Anton Hammerl . 
Hammerl has been missing in Libya since April and is believed dead . 
South Africa has said it got assurances from Libya that the journalist was alive . 
But a Libyan government spokesman has said his whereabouts were unknown . 
`` We never had him with us at any stage , '' spokesman Musa Ibrahim has said . 
The meeting came as Gadhafi 's grip on power appeared to continue to loosen . 
Eight generals from his army have defected to Italy , the Italian Foreign Ministry told CNN Monday . 
The generals were accompanied by more than 100 Libyan soldiers , a senior Italian official with firsthand knowledge of , and responsibility for , the operation said . 
The Libyans crossed their country 's border into Tunisia , where they were met by Italian intelligence agents , the official said . 
Italy announced Monday that it will open a consulate Tuesday in the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi . 
Also Monday , the first locally based television station to operate in Libya since the start of the revolution was to begin broadcasting from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
The station was founded by Momammed Nabus , who later was one of five journalists killed in the conflict . 
`` Gadhafi forces assassinated him for highlighting to the rest of the world the atrocities committed by the Gadhafi regime , '' said Zuheir Al-Barasi , who was to open the station 's broadcast from the city 's courthouse . 
In recent weeks , Gadhafi has been seen in public only rarely as NATO has stepped up attacks against his sprawling Bab el-Azizia compound . 
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that Gadhafi 's `` reign of terror is coming to an end . '' 
`` He is increasingly isolated at home and abroad , '' Rasmussen said during a speech in Bulgaria . 
`` Even those closest to him are departing , defecting or deserting . '' 
Rasmussen also said NATO has made `` significant progress '' in its Libya operation . 
NATO said Monday it has conducted 3,385 strike sorties in Libya since March . 
`` We have seriously degraded Gadhafi 's ability to kill his own people , '' Rasmussen said in his speech . 
`` We have prevented more massacres in Misrata and elsewhere across the country , and we are saving lives every day . '' 
The NATO-led bombing campaign began in March after the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of any means necessary -- short of occupation -- to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi 's forces . 
On Sunday , Libyan opposition forces continued to fend off attacks near the rebel-held port city of Misrata . 
But rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil said over the weekend that the opposition movement is running out of money even as it has achieved key victories militarily and diplomatically . 
`` We are going through a financial crisis , '' said Jalil , chairman of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council . 
In a speech in Geneva , Switzerland , the United Nations ' top human rights official noted Monday `` the brutality and magnitude of measures '' taken by the Libyan government . 
The government 's actions have been `` shocking , '' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said , criticizing the `` outright disregard for basic human rights . ''

2011-05-31,"Argentinian fights with Libyan rebels From Nicolas Garcia , For CNN Anti-Gadhafi rebels have been battling for control of towns across Libya for months Jose Emmanuel Piaggesi says the revolutionary Che Guevara inspires him He says he is fighting `` for liberty '' alongside Libyan rebels in Misrata The battle is unpopular with many of the Latin American leftists he typically supports `` He was always a guy who felt good helping , '' his father tells a newspaper Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jose Emmanuel Piaggesi was a teacher in Argentina , but now the piercing staccato of gunfire punctuates his conversations . 
The 23-year-old has traded books for bullets , saying Che Guevara inspires him as he fights alongside Libyan rebels in Misrata . 
He is ready to give his life in the battle to end Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
It 's an unpopular war with many of the Latin American leftists he typically supports . 
`` I invite them to look a little more closely at the situation , who is here fighting and why is he fighting , '' Piaggesi said as he took a break to prepare for the next round of clashes . 
`` He is going to say that it is for liberty -- not for NATO or for anybody , simply for liberty . '' 
It 's a question of inadvertently dodging bullets . 
And when it 's your turn , it 's your turn . 
The unlikely story of an Argentinian fighting with the Libyan opposition has drawn national attention in Piaggesi 's home country . 
His father , Pablo Piaggesi , told Argentina 's Perfil newspaper that he was not surprised his son had chosen to fight for a cause he supports . 
`` He was always a guy who felt good helping , and was disinterested in money . 
He is a very special person , very talented . 
He speaks four languages . 
He learned to speak Arabic on the Internet in two months , '' he said . 
Pablo Piaggesi told the newspaper that his son was a longtime admirer of Guevara , and had recently visited the museum honoring the Argentinian revolutionary . 
Jose Emmanuel Piaggesi said he was proud to be fighting for a new revolution . 
But he noted that many have already fallen . 
`` I think it 's a question of inadvertently dodging bullets . 
And when it 's your turn , it 's your turn , '' he said . 
But despite the danger , the teacher said he has no plans to head back to the classroom anytime soon . 
After speaking to CNN , he returned to his post on the battlefield , where he pledged to stay until Gadhafi is removed from power .

2011-05-31,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue May 31 , 2011 2:56 pm BST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Jamal al-Farisi 's brother was killed by a fighter loyal to Muammar Gaddafi , but he shows no hatred or desire for retribution , an attitude that contradicts the bitterness that defines many civil wars . 
In Libya 's rebel-held east , there is a conspicuous lack of the deep and fractious animosities that fuelled internal conflicts in Iraq , Northern Ireland , Rwanda , Libya 's neighbor Algeria and elsewhere . 
Almost all invective is aimed at just one man : Gaddafi . 
`` Who do I hate ? 
I do n't want Libyan soldiers prosecuted . 
You 're a soldier and you have to follow orders , '' said Farisi , whose brother Fathi was killed in February at the beginning of the uprising against Gaddafi 's absolute rule . 
In east Libya at least , evidence of the brutality that has marked most recent civil conflicts -- in particular dumped bodies bearing signs of torture and mutilation -- is hard to find . 
One reason cited by people in Benghazi , the rebel capital , is Libya 's homogeneity . 
Virtually all Libyans are Arab Sunni Muslims , unlike Iraq , for example , where in the years following the 2003 U.S. invasion , extreme violence fed on divisions between Sunnis , Shi'ites , Kurds and Christians . 
The main fault lines seen in Libyan society are tribal . 
Gaddafi has manipulated the country 's tribal structures through patronage of some tribes and intimidation of others , to consolidate power . 
Some analysts see tribal strife further destabilising Libya should Gaddafi fall . 
The Libyan leader still controls much of the country 's west and the capital Tripoli , despite increasing pressure from NATO airstrikes . 
The rebels however have been keen to disavow tribalism , and Farisi did not want tribal violence in his brother 's name . 
`` If we tried all Gaddafi 's soldiers , there would be real civil war . 
Each man has a tribe behind him ... There has to be reconciliation , '' he said . 
It is difficult to tell how widespread Farisi 's views are , but his conciliatory tone is echoed by many others in the east including the rebel leadership , whose National Transitional Council on Saturday offered an amnesty to Gaddafi supporters who defect . 
In Benghazi , the bodies of dead Gaddafi soldiers and those of rebels that fought against them are buried in the same cemetery . 
They are washed according to Islamic ritual and prayers are said for all , cemetery and morgue workers said . 
`` We do n't have the custom of ` These are Gaddafi 's people , throw them over there ' . 
They 're all martyrs , and they 're buried together with our martyrs , '' said grave digger Ghaith Hussein . 
`` These people were just following orders ... Our problem is with the one who gave the orders , '' he added . 
Hussein and others said those who fought the rebels may have been forced to do so , or could have been fooled by Gaddafi 's propaganda . 
The Libyan leader 's autocratic rule has been brutal , and deserters risk the death penalty . 
On state TV , he has labeled the rebels rats and drug-addled followers of al Qaeda . 
At Benghazi 's courthouse , lawyer Breika Bitamar says she will volunteer to defend captured Gaddafi loyalists for free . 
`` Some of them may genuinely believe the rebels are al Qaeda , or that they are fighting a crusader from abroad in the form of NATO , '' she said . 
`` Some of these men think they are fighting for Libya , and anyone who dies fighting for Libya is a martyr , '' she added . 
However , the magnanimity towards Libyan Gaddafi loyalists felt by some in the rebel-held east rarely extends to African mercenaries , who the rebels say Gaddafi has hired to quell the revolt against his four-decade rule . 
After battles , rebels often display identity cards taken from the bodies of people from Chad , Niger , Mali , Mauritania and other African states . 
Rebels who blame the actions of Gaddafi 's Libyan troops on a misunderstanding are less indulgent with the mercenaries . 
But morgue worker Haroun Salem , who has handled the bodies of men accused of being mercenaries , bears them no ill will , and has washed their bodies and prayed for them at the cemetery . 
`` Sometimes we find counterfeit or out of date money in their pockets , '' he said . 
`` Gaddafi has tricked them , just like he tricked us for 41 years . 
God have mercy upon them . ''

2011-06-01,"By the CNN Wire Staff On the frontlines in Libya NEW : The Libyan oil minister says the nation 's political structure is in shambles NATO extends its campaign in Libya 90 days , the alliance says Gadhafi is considering a possible cease-fire , a Libyan spokesman says Under the prospective accord , `` everything would be on the table , '' he says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's oil minister confirmed Wednesday that he 's defected and said he 's considering signing up with the opposition movement . 
The announcement , another blow to the Moammar Gadhafi regime , comes after NATO said it has decided to extend its mission in Libya by 90 days , continuing a campaign that began in March . 
Shukri Ghanem told CNN in Rome that he left Libya because the suffering of the people became too unbearable . 
`` This war is getting even worse every day and there is no end to it and we would like to end this thing peacefully and come back to a solution quickly to reinstate democracy and constitutional government , '' he said . 
Man aids struggling Libyan refugees The opposition 's National Transitional Council is based in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . 
Ghanem could n't predict how long the Gadhafi regime will last but said the strongman 's political structure is in shambles . 
He said he does n't know how long he 'll be in Rome or when he 'll return to Libya . 
As for the NATO mission extension , Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen issued a statement saying , `` We are determined to continue our operation to protect the people of Libya . 
`` We will sustain our efforts to fulfill the United Nations mandate . 
We will keep up the pressure to see it through . '' 
Resolution 1973 was approved by the U.N. Security Council in March and authorized member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . '' 
The Libyan government has accused NATO of killing hundreds of civilians and wounding thousands more during a two-month bombing campaign in Libya . 
Between March 19 and May 26 , NATO air strikes have killed 718 `` civilian martyrs , '' according to Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim , who on Tuesday accused the alliance of acting outside `` the limits of international law . '' 
Another 4,067 were injured , he said . 
CNN can not independently verify the figures . 
The government released the numbers after meetings between Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and South African President Jacob Zuma in which the men discussed a possible African Union-brokered cease-fire , Ibrahim said . 
Under the prospective accord , `` everything would be on the table , '' said Ibrahim , `` including the place and position of Gadhafi . '' 
But , Ibrahim said , the country 's longtime ruler would not step down from power as a prerequisite for further dialogue concerning the prospective cease-fire . 
Zuma had `` lengthy discussions '' with Gadhafi , his office said in a news release . 
`` We call on all leaders in Libya to exercise decisive leadership to find a solution to the crisis in the country , and to put the interests of their country first , '' Zuma said in the release . 
He also urged `` NATO and other parties to respect the -LRB- African Union 's -RRB- role in searching for a solution . '' 
An intensified NATO campaign has resulted in sizable defections from the Gadhafi camp , including eight generals who recently fled to Italy , the U.N. Under-Secretary-General B. Lynn Pascoe said in a written statement . 
In recent weeks , Gadhafi has been seen in public only rarely as NATO has stepped up attacks against his sprawling Bab el-Azizia compound . 
Rasmussen said Monday that Gadhafi 's `` reign of terror is coming to an end . '' 
`` He is increasingly isolated at home and abroad , '' Rasmussen said in a speech in Bulgaria . 
`` Even those closest to him are departing , defecting or deserting . '' 
Rasmussen said NATO has made `` significant progress '' in its Libya operation after conducting more than 3,300 strike sorties since March . 
Opposition forces have also gained ground in the port city of Misrata , pushing westward toward the Libyan capital , the statement said . 
Government forces have regrouped in positions along the country 's western Nafusa mountains , especially near the city of Yefran , where some 54,000 Libyans have fled to neighboring Tunisia , Pascoe said . 
Close to 900,000 people have fled Libya since the recent conflict began back in February , the United Nations says . 
Ghanem has been in charge of an industry battered by the civil conflict raging across the country . 
According to Ghanem 's curriculum vitae on the website of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , he is married with three daughters and one son . 
He received a bachelor 's degree in economics at the University of Libya in Benghazi and earned advanced degrees in the United States , at Tufts University 's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston . 
Ghanem has master 's degrees in both economics and law and diplomacy and a doctorate in international economics , the website says . 
He 's held various positions in the Libya 's government , including several spots in the Oil Ministry , and has been director of the OPEC secretariat 's research division . 
He has written many articles and books on energy , it says . 
He was secretary of the General People 's Committee from June 2003 to March 2006 , a position that 's equivalent to prime minister . 
Ghanem has been chairman of the Management Committee of the National Oil Corporation from April 2006 to the present .

2011-06-01,"By the CNN Wire Staff A compound belonging to embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was hit by explosions on Saturday morning . 
A Libyan official says NATO strikes two compounds Libyan opposition says it sold $ 160 million of oil to China NATO says it targeted a vehicle storage area at Bab bin Ghashir Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of Libya 's opposition government told reporters Saturday he welcomed a call Friday by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for Moammar Gadhafi to step down . 
Medvedev 's statement , echoing the stance of American and European leaders , appeared to indicate a closing diplomatic window for the longtime Libyan strongman . 
The chairman of the National Transitional Council , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , said he has offered amnesty to Gadhafi loyalists who defect before the demise of the regime , but reiterated that there will be `` no negotiation for any solution until Gadhafi 's departure . '' 
Once that happens , elections and a constitutional referendum will be held within a year , Jailil said in the opposition stronghold of Benghazi . 
In an interview with CNN , Jalil said the council had sold a shipment of oil to China for $ 160 million . 
The confirmation of the sale is expected to buttress the political and economic credibility of the fledgling rebel power . 
Man aids struggling Libyan refugees Libya opposition : ` We really need money ' The leader said the movement has a `` financial crisis '' and is seeking loans from outside the country . 
The council is happy for political support , but will not ask Russia for arms or economic aid , Jalil said . 
The unrest in Libya has persisted for months as opposition members demand an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . 
Jalil marked the 100th day of the nation 's civil war . 
`` We see victories emerging at both national and international levels , '' he said . 
`` We should celebrate what our heroic sons have accomplished in Misrata and the Nafusa mountains , as well as applaud the wide international support for our revolution . '' 
Meanwhile , a series of morning explosions rocked the capital of Tripoli on Saturday , including blasts at a compound belonging to Gadhafi and one at a nearby tribal compound , a government official said . 
The official said one morning strike occurred on Bab bin Ghashir , a tribal compound near Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound , where the other strikes occurred . 
The official believed the strikes were NATO attacks . 
Morning strikes in Tripoli are rare . 
NATO confirmed one of the attacks -- a press officer said the strike on Bab bin Ghashir was timed to minimize civilian casualties . 
NATO said it targeted a vehicle storage area at Bab bin Ghashir . 
The tribal compound is used by people who volunteer as support forces for Libyan authorities . 
A decade ago , the site was used as a military station . 
NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of any means -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians from attack or the threat of attack . 
It has been conducting airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources .

2011-06-02,"NEW : Rights group official says `` all eyes '' are on eastern Libya officials No reaction from Qatari officials on Eman al-Obeidy 's deportation U.S. `` very concerned ; '' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees seeks explanation Al-Obeidy tells CNN she was beaten , handcuffed and forced onto a plane in Qatar -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eman al-Obeidy , who grabbed the world 's attention this spring when she accused Moammar Gadhafi 's security forces of gang raping her , has been forced back to Libya , which she had fled in fear . 
Qatari authorities took her and her parents from a hotel in Doha , the capital , and forced them onto a military plane that left Qatar early Thursday and landed in rebel-held Benghazi . 
Al-Obeidy , who has gone into hiding in the city , said the Qataris beat and handcuffed her before forcing her onto the plane . 
Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her . 
Hours before her deportation , Obeidy told CNN that armed guards had been posted outside her room , preventing the UNHCR representative from assisting her . 
Alleged rape victim flees Libya The Qataris deported her despite repeated requests from U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and unnamed third parties , a UNHCR official told CNN . 
`` Forcibly returning a refugee who survived gang rape not only violates international law , but is cruel and could trigger further trauma , '' said Bill Frelick , refugee program director at Human Rights Watch . 
`` All eyes are now on the authorities in eastern Libya , who should allow al-Obeidy to leave the country . '' 
Human Rights Watch called on the Transitional National Council to allow al-Obeidy to leave the country immediately . 
HRW added that an NTC spokesman had told the group that she was free to travel domestically and abroad . 
Al-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . 
She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men . 
She later fled Libya to Tunisia with the help of two defecting Gadhafi army officers and their families . 
French diplomats drove her from the border and handed her off to rebel officials -- members of the Transitional National Council -- who organized her flight to Qatar . 
She was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported . 
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had prepared papers for her departure from Qatar to begin a new life . 
But her deportation to Benghazi puts her in a city that remains unstable . 
A bomb detonated Wednesday night outside the Tibesti Hotel in Benghazi , which has housed foreign journalists , aid workers and foreign officials since the Libyan conflict began . 
CNN spoke by phone with al-Obeidy from Benghazi , where she had gone into hiding . 
She said that , besides beating her and forcing her onto the plane , the Qataris had taken everything from her and her parents , including cell phones , her laptop , and money . 
In Washington , State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said Thursday that the department is `` very concerned '' about al-Obeidy 's safety and had communicated with her . 
He said officials were working with international organizations to make sure she is safe and finds asylum in `` a third country . '' 
A number of nongovernmental organizations said they were making efforts to get al-Obeidy out of Benghazi to a destination in Europe in the next few days . 
After arriving in Qatar , al-Obeidy made public statements saying the Transitional National Council -- the Libyan rebel leadership -- was using her . 
The council denied that , but her presence in Qatar appears to have become an embarrassment to the organization . 
Qatar 's government is allied with the rebels . 
The UNHCR said it was seeking an explanation from Qatari authorities for al-Obeidy 's deportation . 
An official at the Qatari Embassy in Washington asked CNN to e-mail questions about the deportation , but did not respond to them .

NEW : Military vehicles and equipment are among the targets struck Airstrikes hit the western town of Yefren , where rebels claim liberation Western Libya is where rebels and pro-Gadhafi forces are in combat A rebel in nearby stronghold of Zintan claims liberation for Yefren and another town -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO used attack helicopters for the first time Saturday as part of its military operation aimed at increasing pressure on Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's regime . 
`` The use of attack helicopters provides the NATO operation with additional flexibility to track and engage pro-Gadhafi forces who deliberately target civilians and attempt to hide in populated areas , '' NATO said in a statement . 
Military vehicles and equipment were among the targets struck by the helicopters . 
NATO did not disclose where the strikes took place . 
On Friday , fighting continued in the western town of Yefren , where NATO-allied aircraft destroyed government tanks and personnel carriers , officials said . 
NATO warplanes belonging to the United Kingdom 's Royal Air Force fired Paveway guided bombs and destroyed two main battle tanks and two armored personnel carriers belonging to Libya 's military , said Maj. Gen. John Lorimer , strategic communication officer for the chief of the defense staff . 
The airstrikes occurred Thursday , he said . 
NATO reported that government forces were continuing `` to attack the peoples of the western highlands , '' Lorimer said . 
Meanwhile , rebels claimed to liberate Yefren and the nearby town of Kikla , both of which are about 25 miles east of their stronghold in Zintan , one rebel fighter said . 
Talhat al-Jiwayli , a rebel on the front lines in Zintan , also said that anti-Gadhafi forces were surrounding the town of al-Rayyana , more than 7 miles northeast of Zintan . 
Al-Jiwayli added that the situation on the ground was still tense , and the troops of Gadhafi were still firing daily barrages of Grad rockets on Zintan and surrounding villages . 
In other measures against Gadhafi 's forces Thursday , NATO airstrikes hit four surface-to-air missile launchers near Tripoli ; a tank , two armored personnel carriers and an ammunition storage facility near Mizdah ; more ammunition storage facilities near Hun and Qaryat ; two armored fighting vehicles near Sirte ; and a command and control node in Brega and nearby radar , according to NATO . 
The latest NATO strikes occurred two days after the alliance announced its decision to extend its mission in Libya by 90 days , continuing a campaign that began in March . 
The resolution approved by the U.N. Security Council in March authorized member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . ''

2011-06-03,"Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi gives a speech in Rome in this August 30 , 2010 file photo . 
TRIPOLI | Fri Jun 3 , 2011 4:48 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - China made its first confirmed contact with Libyan rebels in the latest diplomatic setback for Muammar Gaddafi , and France said on Friday it was working with those close to the veteran ruler to persuade him to leave power . 
The meeting in Qatar between a Chinese diplomat and the leader of the rebel National Transitional Council follows a spate of defections by high profile figures this week , including top oil official and former prime minister Shokri Ghanem . 
Libyan rebels and NATO have made Gaddafi 's departure a condition for agreeing a ceasefire in a conflict that has killed thousands , but he emphatically told visiting South African President Jacob Zuma this week he would not leave Libya . 
A NATO-led military alliance extended its mission to protect civilians in Libya for a further 90 days this week , and France said it was stepping up military pressure as well as working with those close to Gaddafi to try to persuade him to quit . 
`` He is more and more isolated , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told Europe 1 radio . 
`` There have been more defections around him and we have received messages from his close entourage which has understood that he must leave power . '' 
In Beijing , a terse Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said Beijing 's ambassador to Qatar , Zhang Zhiliang , had met and `` exchanged views on developments in Libya '' with Mustafa Abdel Jalil , the chairman of the rebel council that is trying to offer itself as a credible temporary alterative to Gaddafi . 
The ministry gave no details of the talks but the meeting itself was an indication that Beijing wants to keep open lines of communication with the rebel forces . 
China was among the emerging powers that abstained in March when the United Nations Security Council voted to authorize NATO-led air strikes . 
China was never especially close to Gaddafi , but it generally tries to avoid taking firm sides in other countries ' domestic conflicts , including in the Middle East , where it has been buying growing quantities of oil . 
In Tripoli , government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said he had no immediate comment on China 's meeting with the rebels . 
CLASHES REPORTED IN WESTERN MOUNTAINS Now in its fourth month , the Libyan conflict is deadlocked , with rebels unable to break out of their strongholds and advance toward Tripoli , where Gaddafi appears to be entrenched . 
Rebels control the east of Libya around Benghazi , where the rebel council is based , and a mountain range stretching from the town of Zintan , 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , toward the western border with Tunisia . 
In London , Major General John Lorimer said British warplanes destroyed two tanks and two armored personnel carriers on Thursday in Yafran , 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- southwest of Tripoli , where he said Gaddafi 's forces were continuing to attack rebels . 
A rebel spokesman in the Western Mountains town of Nalut , Kalefa Ali , said rebels had been fighting forces loyal to Gaddafi in Trumeet to the south of Yafran and in Bir Ayyad . 
The rebels took over Bir Ayyad , a road junction which controls access to Yafran from the north , and replaced the green Libyan flags there with the red , black and green rebel flag , a Reuters cameraman said . 
`` Bir Ayyad is under rebel control , '' a rebel called Mohammed told Reuters by telephone . 
He said no rebel fighters were wounded in the fighting . 
In Misrata , rebel leader Abdelsalam reported fighting in Dafniyah to the west of the city . 
`` It started at 10 am and Gaddafi 's forces have been shelling Dafniyah since then , using mortars and heavier rockets , '' he said . 
He said revolutionaries in Zlitan had been supplied with weapons and telecommunications equipment from Misrata and Benghazi , and had been waging attacks at night , `` but not on the scale that threatens Gaddafi 's forces ' iron grip on Zlitan . '' 
Zlitan is the next town to the west of Misrata , and one of only three between there and Tripoli . 
Libyan television reported on Friday that forces of the `` crusader coalition '' had shelled civilian and military targets in Al Jufrah , 450 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- southeast of Tripoli . 
BODIES OF AFRICAN REFUGEES FOUND In Tunisia , a U.N. official said the bodies of 150 African refugees fleeing turmoil in Libya had been recovered off the Tunisian coast after the vessels carrying them illegally to Europe got into difficulty . 
Tunisian authorities rescued 570 people , but many others went into the water when a stampede to get off the small fishing boats -- combined with the effect of rough seas -- capsized some of the vessels , a Tunisian official said . 
In all about 250 people were reported on Thursday as missing from the vessels . 
The United Nations has warned government-held parts of Libya were running out of food and the capital Tripoli this week saw the first big protest in months against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . 
Gaddafi says the rebels are armed criminals and al Qaeda militants , and has called the NATO intervention an act of colonial aggression designed to grab Libya 's plentiful oil . 
Western governments say they believe they are wearing down Gaddafi 's ability to control Libya through a combination of diplomatic pressure and military action , although the U.S. role in the conflict in particular has been controversial at home . 
The House of Representatives prepared to vote on differing approaches to U.S. involvement in Libya , one directing President Barack Obama to pull U.S. forces out of NATO operations and a second that demands more information about U.S. strategy . 
The resolutions are a response from U.S. lawmakers in both main parties who are unhappy the United States is now in a third conflict after Iraq and Afghanistan .

2011-06-04,"By the CNN Wire Staff Hundreds of migrants have fled Libya by boat since the start of the country 's civil war . 
U.N. refugee agency : 578 people survive the sinking Thousands of refugees fleeing the conflict in Libya try to get to Europe An overcrowded boat with about 850 people aboard left Tripoli for Italy last weekend The boat capsized in the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 150 people drowned when a boat leaving Libya capsized off the Tunisian coast this week , the U.N. refugee agency said Friday . 
Scores more were still missing as a rescue operation by Tunisian authorities continued . 
But at least 578 people survived the sinking Wednesday , according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees . 
On Thursday , 195 survivors were transferred to a humanitarian aid camp close to the Tunisia-Libya border , according to a statement from the refugee agency . 
An additional 383 survivors were expected to be taken to the same or nearby camps for help . 
The overcrowded boat , which set sail May 28 from Tripoli , was headed for the Italian island of Lampedusa carrying about 850 people . 
The passengers were mostly migrants from West Africa , Pakistan and Bangladesh who were fleeing fighting in Libya , the refugee agency said in a statement . 
The agency said some survivors reported the boat was manned by people with little or no maritime experience . 
Soon after the boat left Tripoli , it ran into difficulties and by Tuesday , the passengers ran out of food and water . 
The boat ran aground Wednesday near the Kerkennah Islands , about 300 kilometers -LRB- about 186 miles -RRB- northwest of Tripoli in the Mediterranean Sea , the refugee agency reported . 
`` Desperate passengers rushed to one side , seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel , '' and the boat capsized , the agency said . 
`` This appears to be one of the worst and the deadliest incidents in the Mediterranean so far this year , '' said Adrian Edwards , a spokesman for the refugee agency . 
Lampedusa , the closest Italian island to Africa , has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter Europe . 
More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked the dangerous journey to Lampedusa . 
At one point , the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa , which numbers less than 6,000 . 
`` Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months , sometimes with tragic consequences , '' the refugee agency said in its statement . 
`` Just last month , hundreds died as a vessel carrying about 600 people broke up shortly after departing Tripoli . ''

2011-06-05,"By the CNN Wire Staff At least one person is thought to have died while in the custody of Libyan rebels , Human Rights Watch said in its report . 
NEW : NATO conducted airstrikes Sunday against pro-government targets in Tripoli Robert Gates : `` It 's only a matter of time '' for Moammar Gadhafi British foreign secretary : TNC members are `` genuine believers in democracy '' Dozens of civilians are held for being loyal to Gadhafi , Human Rights Watch says -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As NATO airstrikes continue to pound pro-government facilities in Libya , Human Rights Watch charged Sunday that Libyan rebels are arbitrarily detaining dozens of civilians suspected of loyalty to ruler Moammar Gadhafim , holding them without trial or due process . 
At least one person is thought to have died in custody , with his body showing signs of torture , the group said in a report based on visits to rebel-held parts of Libya . 
It is difficult to tell exactly how many civilians are being held without charge because some are held by militias and because the rebels do not clearly distinguish between civilian detainees and captured pro-Gadhafi fighters , Human Rights Watch said . 
The rebel Transitional National Council , based in Benghazi in eastern Libya , is seeking international support including money in its battle to oust Gadhafi . 
A NATO-led mission that has focused airstrikes on Gadhafi 's military capability bolsters the rebel efforts . 
However , the Human Rights Watch report raised questions about the rebel leadership 's overall control of its forces and observation of human rights . 
In addition to the report , the United States expressed disappointment last week over the expulsion by Qatar of Eman al-Obeidy to Libya , a decision that it called a `` breach of humanitarian norms . '' 
Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her . 
Al-Obeidy grabbed the world 's attention earlier this year when she accused Gadhafi 's security forces of gang-raping her . 
She then fled Libya and was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday to Benghazi . 
A high-level U.S. State Department source said Sunday al-Obeidy had left Libya and was on the way to Malta with her father . 
Al-Obeidy , who is being accompanied by a U.N. Human Rights Commission representative , will eventually head to a processing center in Europe before leaving for a final destination , the source said . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague reiterated support for the Transitional National Council Sunday . 
`` These people at the top of this organization are genuine believers in democracy in the rule of law , '' Hague told the BBC Sunday . 
`` It is quite inspiring ... to see their real hope for the future of their country . '' 
`` Certainly I think they are genuine in wanting a democratic Libya and in their hopes for a free country , '' Hague said . 
Meanwhile , NATO aircraft carried out sustained airstrikes against targets in Tripoli Sunday , including command and control centers , several military support facilities and anti-aircraft weapon sites , according to a statement from NATO headquarters . 
`` The targets that were struck overnight were vital to the pro-Qadhafi forces ' ability to harm the civilian population - essentially they are the hub of Qadhafi 's command network , '' said Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , Commander of Operation Unified Protector . 
`` We will continue to erode its foundations until the violence against the Libyan population ends , '' U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates believes the sustained campaign is having an effect . 
`` Day by day , Gadhafi is seeing the people that are closest to him walking away , '' he said Sunday on a visit to Afghanistan . '' 
... clearly the continuing pounding he is taking , the isolation , is all having an effect . 
The entire international community is basically saying he 's got to go , a lot of sanctions -LRB- are -RRB- in place , the bombing continues against his forces . 
`` The opposition has been able to not only hold where they are in the east , they 've been able to expand their security area around the coastal city of Misrata , and the guys in the west are holding their own , '' Gates added . 
`` So I guess my forecast could be that it 's only a matter of time . 
I do n't think anybody knows how long , but I think we see signs the regime is getting shakier by the day and it 's just a question of when everybody around Gadhafi decides that it 's time to throw in the towel , and throw him under the bus . '' 
Also Sunday , a string of explosions -- at least 6 -- rocked the Libyan capital , CNN journalists reported . 
One of the explosions struck an old military station about 25 kilometers -LRB- 16 miles -RRB- south of the city , a government official said . 
A resolution approved by the U.N. Security Council in March authorized member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . ''

26 bodies are recovered , a coast guard official tells Tunisia 's state news agency About 800 refugees were heading from Libya to Lampedusa , Italy Between 200 and 270 people are missing from the overcrowded boat -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 26 bodies have been recovered from the sea after a Libyan trawler got into trouble last week , but hundreds are still missing , according to Tunisia 's state-run TAP news agency . 
Bad weather is preventing the recovery of more bodies , the head of the Sfax coast guard told TAP Monday . 
The agency did not name the official . 
As many as 270 Libyan refugees were missing in the Mediterranean Sea after the overcrowded boat they were in encountered bad weather , the Tunisian state-run TAP news agency reported last week . 
The Tunisian coast guard responded to the rescue call regarding the fishing trawler , which became disabled Wednesday night near the Kerkennah Islands . 
The ship was reportedly taking some 800 refugees from Libya to the Italian island of Lampedusa , TAP reported . 
Between 200 and 270 people were missing , while 577 people were rescued , the coast guard official told TAP Monday . 
People on the boat began pushing each other in a panic to reach the lifeboats when they ran into high waves and winds , TAP said . 
Lampedusa , the closest Italian island to Africa , has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter the European Union . 
More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February . 
Lampedusa and Malta , both islands less than an hour 's flight from the North African coast , have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration . 
At one point , the population of migrants vastly outnumbered Lampedusa 's residents , who number about 6,000 .

Al-Obeidy had fled Libya and was awaiting resettlement as a refugee in Qatar when she was deported Thursday and sent back to Benghazi in Libya .

It may take weeks before she gets to that destination . 
Another U.S. State Department source said Sunday the United States was deeply concerned about her well-being , and worked closely with officials in Europe and Libya to get her safely out of the country . 
The same source said the U.S. is `` prepared to provide whatever help and support Eman may need . '' 
Alleged Libya rape victim heads to Malta Qatar deports alleged Libyan rape victim Rape suspects accuse woman of slander Al-Obeidy has told CNN on repeated occasions that she wants to go to the United States . 
One of the State Department sources told CNN that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton `` has been deeply interested in the case and has followed it throughout . '' 
Al-Obeidy was reportedly beaten before being deported from Qatar . 
Najah Dawaji , a U.S.-based Libyan freedom activist , said she was with three key members of Libya 's opposition Transitional National Council when they learned that al-Obeidy was forced from Doha and arrived in Benghazi on Thursday . 
She said al-Obeidy had a black eye , bruises on her legs and scratches on her arms . 
Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her . 
After arriving in Qatar , al-Obeidy had made public statements saying the Transitional National Council was using her . 
The council denied that . 
Council members were upset upon seeing al-Obeidy 's condition and vowed to open an investigation , Dawaji said . 
The United States said it was `` disappointed '' by al-Obeidy 's expulsion , which it said was `` a breach of humanitarian norms . '' 
Amnesty International called the deportation `` outrageous , '' saying the action by the Qatari government `` is a serious breach by Qatar of its international obligations . ''

2011-06-06,"Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sent an envoy to Libya Monday to meet with rebels trying to bring about an end to Moammar Gadhafi 's 42-year-rule , a move that comes after he called for the Libyan leader to step down . 
Mikhail Margelov , the presidential special envoy on Africa , was expected to meet with leaders of the rebel Transitional National Council based in the eastern Libyan rebel-stronghold of Benghazi , his spokeswoman , Varvara Paal , said . 
Margelov did not rule out traveling to Tripoli to meet with Gadhafi , Paal said . 
`` My task is to meet with rebel leaders . 
However , I do not rule out that I may have to go to Tripoli , too , if I get the corresponding order from the president , '' Margelov told Interfax , the Russian news agency . 
Last month , Medvedev joined American and other European leaders in calling for Gadhafi to step down from power . 
The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Gadhafi , his son and Libya 's intelligence chief for alleged crimes against humanity . 
Meanwhile , on Monday , the Swiss government authorized the state 's attorney general to open a criminal investigation into the kidnappings of two of its citizens , Rachid Hamdani and Max Goeldi , who allegedly have been held hostage in Libya for nearly two years . 
The developments came as rebels on the front line in Misrata said the main station supplying electricity to the city , which had been targeted by Gadhafi forces , had been hit . 
The attack left some areas of the city without power . 
According to various rebel fighters , Gadhafi 's forces carried out an early morning offensive on both the western and eastern fronts of Misrata . 
Government forces pushed 2 kilometers -LRB- 1.25 miles -RRB- into the city of Dafniya on the west side of Misrata and fired dozens of Grad rockets , destroying a plastic factory which killed one person and injured at least one other . 
Rebel fighters were able to stop the attacks and pushed toward the west 3 kilometers -LRB- 1.9 miles -RRB- to the outskirts of the city of Zlitan , rebels said . 
Two people were killed and 17 others were wounded in the fighting on the western front of Misrata , rebels said . 
Libya has been in the throes of a civil war for months , since Gadhafi dug in his heels against popular efforts to force him out of power amid anti-government protests sweeping the Arab world .

2011-06-07,"By the CNN Wire Staff Gadhafi : ` We will not give up ' NEW : At least 31 killed in Libya , including civilians , Libyan government spokesman says Gadhafi speaks as his compound is bombarded by NATO airstrikes `` Dead , alive , victorious , it does n't matter , '' he says in vowing to stay until the end At least 35 loud explosions are heard around midday in Tripoli Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi vowed Tuesday that `` we will not surrender , '' even as NATO airstrikes bombarded his compound in Tripoli . 
`` I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me , '' Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television . 
`` But my soul is in God 's hand . 
We will not think about death or life . 
We will think about the call of duty . '' 
At least three explosions rocked Tripoli late Tuesday night ; it was not immediately clear what they hit . 
Earlier in the day , NATO targeted a military base and Gadhafi 's compound , state television reported . 
A spokesman for the Libyan government said that at least 31 people were killed , including a number of civilians , and dozens more were wounded after 60 missiles struck the capital city . 
The compound was under `` intensive continuous bombardment , '' according to state TV , which reported buildings and infrastructure were destroyed . 
`` We will not surrender , we will not give up , '' Gadhafi said . 
`` We have one option -- our country . 
We will remain in it 'til the end . 
Dead , alive , victorious , it does n't matter . '' 
The blasts Tuesday , and others Monday that Libyan officials said hit state television buildings , elicited heated responses from the government spokesman . 
`` We believe NATO understands that its military campaign is failing miserably , '' said spokesman Musa Ibrahim . 
`` No one has the right to shape Libya 's future except for Libyans . '' 
Ibrahim said Tuesday 's morning blasts hit the popular guard compound and revolution compound , which are military barracks near Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound . 
The spokesman said the attack on the television network killed two people and wounded 16 . 
`` We did not target or hit the Libyan broadcast facilities . 
What we did target was the military intelligence headquarters in downtown Tripoli , '' the alliance said . 
`` The story coming from Libyan officials that we targeted and hit the state broadcaster 's building is bogus . '' 
The back and forth between Libyan officials and NATO continues a public relations war between the two sides . 
Libyan officials have continually charged that NATO airstrikes have damaged civilian facilities and killed hundreds of civilians . 
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said recently that his forces have made `` significant progress '' in its U.N. Security Council mandate to protect Libyan civilians . 
This week , the Libyan government said it had evidence that alliance airstrikes were harming civilians . 
Officials took journalists to Tajura , a city east of Tripoli , to show them a small crater that held what appeared to be the remains of a rocket . 
The reporters were also taken to nearby homes that the government said had been damaged by airstrikes . 
NATO said it had been active in the area hitting military sites but could not say whether the attacks had caused the damage in the residential area . 
Reporters were also taken to a nearby hospital to see Nasib , a comatose baby who was a victim of the airstrikes , the government said . 
A woman , who the government said was Nasib 's mother , cried over the child 's listless body . 
Journalists were not allowed to talk to the woman or to the doctors . 
But one doctor quietly slipped a note to one of the journalists that said the girl was injured in a car accident , not a bomb attack . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague , speaking Tuesday to British lawmakers , said the European Union has added six additional ports controlled by pro-Gadhafi forces to its sanctions list in an effort to starve Gadhafi 's troops of military supplies . 
He said the United Kingdom intends to push for additional sanctions against Gadhafi 's regime . 
`` Any political settlement in Libya requires an end to violence and Gadhafi 's departure , '' Hague said .

`` The council of the European Union adopted a decision today extending the assets freeze to six Libyan port authorities , in view of the gravity of the situation in the country , '' said a statement from the European Council , which represents all EU governments . 
The statement did not give any details of what form the sanctions would take , but EU officials say they will make it illegal for European-operated ships to do business with the port authorities . 
A one-month window has been left for existing contracts , one official said . 
The EU has already imposed a travel ban and wide-ranging asset freeze against some Libyan officials and companies . 
An EU diplomat said last month that EU experts had agreed to put six ports -- Tripoli , Zuara , Zawiyah , Al-Khoms , Ras Lanuf and Brega -- on the sanctions list . 
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's government has been seeking to raise fuel imports by using a loophole in international sanctions after a campaign of Western air strikes against Libya . 
-LRB- ID : nLDE74H1S0 -RRB- `` Today 's action will help to prevent Gaddafi-controlled Libya from acquiring resources which are fuelling military activities , '' British foreign secretary William Hague said in a statement .

2011-06-07,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue Jun 7 , 2011 12:37 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Russian envoy in rebel-held Benghazi on Tuesday said Moscow wanted to help bridge the rift in Libya , stepping up Kremlin efforts to play a prominent role in resolving the conflict . 
`` Some are looking to Benghazi , some are looking to Tripoli . 
Russia sees its task as building a bridge between these two banks on which Libyan society now stands , '' said Mikhail Margelov , President Dmitry Medvedev 's special envoy to Africa . 
At a G8 summit last month , Medvedev joined Western partners in urging Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to step down , offered Russia 's services as a mediator and said he was sending Margelov to Libya , initially to Benghazi . 
Analysts say Russia wants to preserve its influence in a country where it had billions of dollars in arms , energy and railroad deals . 
`` Russia has a unique situation in Libya now : We did not sever relations with Tripoli , we have established relations with Benghazi , '' Margelov told Russia 's state-run Rossiya-24 television upon arrival in Benghazi . 
`` We are ready , if it 's possible , to act as middlemen in establishing an internal Libyan political dialogue . 
Russia is ready to help politically , economically and in any possible way , '' Margelov told a media conference in Benghazi . 
`` We ... believe that Gaddafi has lost his legitimacy after the first bullet shot against the Libyan people , '' he said , adding democracy in Libya would be achieved through elections that would take place after the civil war ends . 
Medvedev had said he hoped Margelov would have the opportunity to speak with both sides , but that he did not travel to Tripoli on this visit . 
He left for Cairo after his talks , Russian media reported . 
Margelov met Mustafa Abdel Jalil , head of the rebel national council , Russian media said . 
He was also to have met Ali Tarhouni , the rebel minister of oil and finance , to discuss the financial situation and more effective aid . 
Russia supported an initial U.N. Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Gaddafi 's government but abstained in the March vote on a second resolution that authorised military intervention . 
It has accused the Western coalition conducting air strikes of going beyond its mandate to protect civilians . 
Rebels fighting to end Gaddafi 's four-decade rule control the east of Libya from their stronghold in Benghazi , the western city of Misrata and the mountains near the border with Tunisia . 
They have been unable to advance on Tripoli against Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces . 
The Libyan capital and vicinity has come under increased attack from NATO bombing in recent days . 
In Oslo , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow is not seeking the leading role in Libyan mediation and emphasised the importance of African Union efforts .

2011-06-08,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan kids help refurbish weapons NEW : A fresh attack on rebel-held Misrata has killed at least 13 , rebels say NATO says it is doing all it can to avoid hurting civilians NATO chief Rasmussen says Gadhafi 's `` reign of terror '' is ending soon Gadhafi vows not to surrender amid heavy bombing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forces loyal to embattled Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi launched a new attack on the rebel-held city of Misrata on Wednesday , with anti-government forces reporting intense shelling from three sides of the city . 
Thousands of government troops attacked around 6 a.m. -LRB- 11 p.m. Tuesday ET -RRB- , with 13 rebels reported dead by evening . 
Mohamed Mokhtar , a rebel fighter wounded in Wednesday 's fighting , accused government troops of infiltrating rebel lines in cars bearing rebel flags . 
Dr. Khaled Abu Falgha , a spokesman for Misrata 's Hekma hospital , said it was the bloodiest day in a week in the besieged city . 
More than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed since the fighting began there in February , including 686 registered residents of the city , he said . 
Rebel fighters returning from the front lines reported that their defenses were holding up under the onslaught , however . 
Gadhafi : ` We will not give up ' NATO making progress in Libya ? 
The assault followed a day of intense bombardment of Libya 's capital by the NATO alliance , which intervened in the conflict in March under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians as Gadhafi tried to crush the revolt against him . 
Libya 's government said 60 missiles struck the capital city , killing at least 31 people , including a number of civilians , and wounding dozens more . 
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen reiterated Wednesday that the alliance is doing all it can to avoid civilian casualties . 
But he told reporters from allied headquarters in Brussels , Belgium , that NATO could continue the airstrikes `` for as long as it takes to bring this crisis to an early conclusion . '' 
Rasmussen said NATO bombing has saved lives in Libya , and that the alliance has the resources to extend its military mission for another 90 days past the end of June . 
It is time to start planning for what to do after Gadhafi 's departure `` because Gadhafi 's reign of terror is coming to an end , '' he said . 
Pressed by reporters on why airstrikes would be able to dislodge Gadhafi when `` the history of the last 30 years '' shows that air attacks alone do not win wars , Rasmussen offered no clear answer , saying only , `` We have no intentions to put troops on the ground . '' 
For his part , even as NATO airstrikes bombarded his Tripoli compound , Gadhafi vowed Tuesday that `` we will not surrender . '' 
`` I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me , '' Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television . 
`` But my soul is in God 's hand . 
We will not think about death or life .

2011-06-08,"WASHINGTON | Wed Jun 8 , 2011 11:26 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama could use frozen Libyan government assets to pay for humanitarian aid to Libyan people caught in the North African country 's civil war under a bill sponsored by a group of leading Senate Democrats and Republicans . 
`` The ongoing violence in Libya has disrupted the economy and left far too many innocent Libyan citizens struggling to simply put food on the table and to manage the daily necessities of life , '' Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson said on Wednesday in a joint statement with the committee 's senior Republican , Richard Shelby . 
The United States is holding more than $ 34 billion as part of sanctions imposed in late February against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his top officials . 
Under the measure , none of the assets could be used to buy weapons or military equipment . 
Some U.S. lawmakers have been wary of directly arming Libyan rebels seeking to overthrow Gaddafi . 
Obama administration officials have said they were looking into whether some of the frozen cash , securities and other financial instruments could be used to aid the Libyan rebel effort . 
Other backers of the bill are Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry , Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin and the panel 's top Republican John McCain , and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman , an Independent . 
Bipartisan agreement on the measure written in consultation with the administration gives it a better chance of quick passage . 
But the measure would still have to clear the U.S. House of Representatives . 
Sponsors of bill said the war in Libya has nearly brought its economy to a halt and has precipitated a humanitarian crisis with food and medical supplies running dangerously low in some areas . 
Rebel groups and forces loyal to the Libyan leader have been fighting in a civil war ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies .

Tesoro , a U.S. refiner , entered into a deal May 25 with the Transitional National Council Deal is for 1.2 million barrels of Libyan crude oil , the State Department says Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrives in UAE for Libya Contact Group meeting Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The rebel government in control of the eastern part of Libya has made its first sale of oil from territory it controls , the State Department confirmed Wednesday . 
Tesoro , a U.S. oil refiner , entered into a deal May 25 with the Transitional National Council based in Benghazi , Libya for 1.2 million barrels of Libyan crude oil , the State Department said in a written statement . 
The shipment was scheduled to arrive aboard the MT Equator , a Liberian-flagged tanker , at the Single Point Mooring in Hawaii on Wednesday . 
The dollar value of the deal is not known . 
U.S. support for additional oil sales with the TNC will continue as a means to support additional revenue streams for the Libyan people , the statement said . 
The sale was made possible following an April announcement by the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department that established a new licensing policy with Libya . 
That action was taken to ease barriers to certain oil related transactions with the TNC , in place because of wider U.S. sanctions on Libya . 
The announcement came the same day Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the United Arab Emirates for a meeting with the Libya Contact Group , a coalition of various countries and international organizations that seek to build support for the TNC while preparing for Libya 's future after the presumed end of Moammar Gadhafi 's regime . 
This is the third meeting of the group . 
France , Italy and Qatar are among the small number of countries who have officially recognized the TNC as the legitimate government of Libya . 
While the United States has yet to take that step , President Barack Obama `` has invited them to open an office in Washington , '' a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Clinton . 
`` We are still considering it but there 's no final decision as of right now , '' the official said of U.S. efforts to offer formal recognition to the TNC .

Full Article Gaddafi forces advance on Libya 's Misrata MISRATA | Thu Jun 9 , 2011 1:00 am IST MISRATA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Thousands of troops loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi advanced on the rebel-held western city of Misrata on Wednesday , shelling it from three sides in attacks that killed at least 12 rebels , a rebel spokesman said . 
The offensive followed a lull in NATO bombing of Tripoli on Wednesday , after 24 hours of some of the heaviest bombardments of the Libyan capital since air strikes began in March . 
NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday , but there were few signs of willingness to intensify their Libya mission , which has so far failed to oust Gaddafi as leader of this oil-producing North African desert state . 
The alliance says the bombing aims to protect civilians from the Libyan leader 's military , which crushed popular protests against his rule in February , leaving many dead . 
The conflict has now become a civil war . 
`` Misrata is under heavy shelling ... Gaddafi forces are shelling Misrata from three sides : east , west and south , '' rebel spokesman Hassan al-Misrati told Reuters from inside the besieged town . 
`` He has sent thousands of troops from all sides and they are trying to enter the city . 
They are still outside , though . '' 
Doctors at the Hekmah hospital in central Misrata told Reuters correspondents who visited it that at least 11 people had been killed and 35 wounded , many seriously . 
There was no immediate comment from Gaddafi 's government . 
A rebel fighter , who declined to be named , vowed revenge . 
`` One day soon , God willing , we will be at Bab al-Aziziya -LRB- Gaddafi 's compound -RRB- and we will find Gaddafi and his military forces and we will kill him , '' he told Reuters . 
With officials like British Foreign Secretary William Hague talking explicitly of Gaddafi being forced out , critics say NATO has gone beyond its U.N. mandate to protect civilians . 
Western powers are lining up behind the rebels . 
Spain 's Foreign Minister on a visit to the eastern city of Benghazi on Wednesday said his country now only recognized their National Transitional Council as the representative of the Libyan people . 
Rebel spokesman Kalefa Ali in the Western mountain town of Nalut said the towns of Yafran and Kalaa , which fell to rebels earlier this week , had been shelled by Gaddafi forces . 
`` Rebels fear that Gaddafi 's forces will launch a wide scale offensive in the western mountains as he is doing in Misrata today , '' said Ali . 
`` He is putting on a fight and not giving up . '' 
Juma Ibrahim , a rebel spokesman in Zintan , said Gaddafi 's forces were holding residents in the world heritage-listed old city of Gadamis , some 600 kilometres southwest of the capital on the Tunisia and Algerian border , after anti-government protests . 
Accounts from the mountains and Gadamis could not be independently verified because access for reporters is limited . 
Gaddafi troops and the rebels have been deadlocked for weeks , with neither side able to hold territory on a road between Ajdabiyah in the east , which Gaddafi forces shelled on Monday , and the Gaddafi-held oil town of Brega further west . 
Rebels control the east of Libya , the western city of Misrata and the range of western mountains near the border with Tunisia . 
They have been unable to advance on the capital against Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces . 
NATO sought broader support for the Western bombing campaign in Libya on Wednesday , given that the alliance 's air power has been stretched by the latest strikes on Tripoli . 
`` We want to see increased urgency in some quarters in terms of Libya , '' British Defense Minister Liam Fox told reporters in Brussels . 
But some NATO allies that have not taken part in the bombing said they would not alter their stance , and Sweden , a non-NATO participant , said it would scale down its role . 
Of the 28 NATO allies , only eight , led by Britain and France , have been conducting air strikes on Gaddafi 's forces , and a senior U.S. official warned this week that fatigue was beginning to set in among the aircrews already committed . 
NATO allies agree Gaddafi must go , but not all view military intervention as the best way to achieve this . 
Germany , which opposed the Libyan intervention , said it understood the pressures on Britain and France but would not change its position . 
Spain said it would not join the mission , despite now recognizing the rebels as Libya 's representatives . 
As bombs fell on Tuesday , Gaddafi vowed to fight to the end . 
`` We only have one choice : we will stay in our land dead or alive , '' he said in a fiery audio address on state television . 
Gaddafi says the rebels are a minority of Islamist militants and the NATO campaign is an attempt to grab Libya 's oil . 
Admiral Mike Mullen , outgoing chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , at a round table event for journalists in Cairo said on Wednesday that Gaddafi must quit . 
Asked if NATO could end operations with Gaddafi still in power , Mullen said : `` It is the United States ' position that Gaddafi has to leave . 
I think it has been a challenge for anybody to put a timetable on that . 
I certainly would n't do that today . 
What I have seen is what I would call very slow progress . 
More and more individuals from his regime are defecting , some of whom are in the military . '' 
Libya 's labor minister al Amin Manfur became the latest to defect from Gaddafi 's government and was reported as saying The Libyan government was selling oil on the black market . 
Attention is also turning to diplomatic overtures ahead of a meeting of the Libya contact group of Western and Arab foreign ministers in the UAE on Thursday . 
Ministers will try to fine tune a post-Gaddafi political transition plan with the rebels . 
China 's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told his visiting Libyan counterpart on Wednesday that the most pressing task facing Libya was to secure an immediate ceasefire .

2011-06-09,"Libyans attend a rally to support rebel fighters and Libyan National Council -LRB- CNT -RRB- , near the courthouse in Benghazi , May 19 , 2011 . 
BENGHAZI , Libya | Thu Jun 9 , 2011 7:16 am EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - To get an idea of who might wield influence in post-civil war Libya , take a look at the flags flying in the rebel-held east of the country . 
Outside the courthouse in Benghazi -- rebel headquarters and symbolic heart of the uprising against the 41-year rule of leader Muammar Gaddafi -- fly the flags of France , Great Britain , the United States , the European Union , NATO . 
There 's one other flag , too : Qatar 's . 
`` Qatar , really , it 's time to convey our gratitude to them , '' Abdulla Shamia , rebel economy chief , told Reuters . 
`` They really helped us a lot . 
It 's a channel for transportation , for help , for everything . '' 
It has a population of just 1.7 million people , but the wealthy Gulf monarchy has long sought a major voice in political affairs in the region . 
It has brokered peace talks in Sudan and Lebanon , owns the influential pan-Arab news network Al Jazeera , and recently won the right to host the 2022 soccer World Cup . 
Now the gas-rich nation has placed a big geopolitical bet in Libya , splashing out hundreds of millions of dollars on fuel , food and cash transfers for the rebels . 
A representative from the Emir 's palace declined to comment on what products Qatar has delivered to Libya , and on the ruling family 's motivations behind its Libyan engagement . 
It 's certainly a gamble . 
If the rebels win , Qatar is likely to pick up energy deals and new influence in North Africa . 
But if they lose , Qatar 's ambitions may further alienate it among its neighbors . 
`` I guess ever since the late 1990s , Qatar has been trying to break the Saudi-dominated status quo and carve out a niche position , '' said Saket Vemprala from the London-based Business Monitor International consultancy . 
`` At the moment I think it 's more geopolitical , they want to broaden their -LRB- influence in the -RRB- region and become a more significant player ... And it certainly makes it easy for them to portray themselves as being on the right side of history , '' he said . 
That sentiment is on display on a huge billboard in front of the courthouse . 
Over a picture of Qatari ruler Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani reads the promise : `` Qatar , history will always remember your support for our cause . '' 
Being on the right side of history does n't come cheap . 
Qatar was the first Arab country to contribute planes to police the U.N.-backed no-fly zone over Libya . 
Simultaneously , hundreds of millions of dollars began to flow from the Qatari capital Doha to Benghazi from early March . 
While international oil traders pondered whether to brave the bombs and international sanctions to start buying oil from the rebels , Qatar was quick to throw a lifeline and help eastern Libya meet its most pressing needs including fuel , food , medicines and telecommunications equipment . 
Qatar 's foreign ministry has confirmed that it has shipped four tankers full of gasoline , diesel and other refined fuels to Benghazi , which specialists estimate is enough to feed the large Benghazi power plant for one or two weeks . 
But people on the ground in Benghazi say they believe Qatar is behind much of the continuing delivery of fuel supplies , as well as food , medicine and cash payments . 
Given that oil production in the east has stalled and the economy generates no cash , they ask , where else are all the supplies coming from ? 
Overall , the Qatari shipments have covered 100 percent of eastern Libya energy needs for a month and a half , Salah Fouad , a rebel oil engineer based in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk , said in May . 
`` We are receiving a huge help from Qatar . 
Its role in unforgettable . 
Even the little child knows Qatar 's role and assistance to us , '' he said . 
A western consultant who worked in Benghazi in March and April supported this view . 
`` You ask port workers how are they doing today and they say , ` Oh , we are fine . 
We just received aid from Qatar , ' '' he said , declining to be named because of the sensitivity of his mission . 
`` You ask the council what 's the situation with diesel and they say , ` Oh we are just fine , we 've got new deliveries from Qatar . ' 
You tell Libyan officials to let you know if something goes wrong with power facilities and they tell you , ` Oh we are just fine , Qatar is helping us . ' '' 
A Gulf-based oil trader with knowledge of Qatari gasoline deliveries estimated monthly requirements at 10 gasoline and 5-6 diesel cargoes a month to help run vehicles and Benghazi 's huge power plant . 
As shipments are being settled on a government-to-government basis , they are usually not followed by satellite tracking systems , which monitor mostly commercial shipments . 
Those commercial shipments have included a test-case export cargo from the rebel-held east , shipped out in early May by trading house Vitol . 
Some traders say Qatar has gone further . 
`` Everyone gets excited about one Vitol cargo and does n't see a fleet of Qatari tankers , '' said another London-based trader . 
Other countries are helping the rebels as well , of course . 
An anti-Gaddafi coalition called the Libya contact group , including the United States , France , Britain and Italy -- as well as Kuwait and Jordan -- agreed in May to set up a fund to help them ; Washington pledged to unlock some of the $ 30 billion -LRB- 18.3 billion pounds -RRB- of Libyan state funds frozen in the United States . 
What makes Qatar different is the breadth and depth of its aid . 
Rebel officials in Doha say Qatari banks are helping facilitate international money transfers in rebel-held areas to recapitalise the paralysed banking system , though they wo n't say which banks . 
Qatar is also believed by diplomatic sources in Doha to have granted some Libyans working for Qatari companies leave of absence so they can contribute to the war effort . 
Several western and Doha-based diplomatic sources say Qatar is even supplying the rebels arms , including possibly Milan anti-tank missiles . 
The Gulf state declined to comment on whether it has supplied the rebels with arms , or in what quantity . 
In May , the rebels estimated they urgently needed $ 2-3 billion in cash . 
When the anti-Gaddafi coalition set up its fund , Qatar immediately pledged the largest sum of $ 400 - $ 500 million . 
What 's behind Qatar 's generosity ? 
It helps that it is so rich . 
Qatar 's copious gas reserves have made it one of the world 's wealthiest countries , with a sky-high gross domestic product per person of $ 88,000 according to the International Monetary Fund . 
Its $ 60-billion plus sovereign wealth fund owns stakes in banks Credit Suisse and Barclays , as well as London 's iconic department store Harrods . 
`` Qatar will soon -- literally -- have more money than it knows what to do with , '' according to a 2008 U.S. diplomatic cable , obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by Reuters . 
The largesse in Libya is part investment , part strategic . 
`` They are looking to park investments around the world . 
They helped the Lebanon peace process , Yemen , they got the World Cup , Doha talks , Al Jazeera -- these are all parts of a very big diplomatic game and a fight for influence , '' says a London-based British diplomat . 
The big prize is energy . 
Libya produced 1.6 million barrels of oil per day before the war , or almost 2 percent of world output , and has enough reserves to sustain that level of production for 77 years , according to BP . 
Qatar would like to control a chunk of that oil supply as well as potentially large Libyan gas exports to Europe which otherwise would effectively rival Qatar 's own deliveries . 
Although gas markets have faced a severe glut in the past few years , the outlook is improving fast , especially in the aftermath of Japan 's Fukushima disaster and the decision by Germany to phase out nuclear power . 
`` Qatar is putting energy at the forefront of its diplomacy . 
Libya brings them closer to Europe and to their future markets . 
They will be right on the Mediterranean , '' said the British diplomat . 
With direct access to Europe , Qatar would be in a position to carve up the gas markets between itself and Russia , with which Doha enjoys increasingly friendly ties . 
There 's also Libya 's sovereign wealth fund -LRB- LIA -RRB- , which has some $ 70 billion worth of assets frozen around the world . 
The LIA owns stakes in Italian bank UniCredit , defense company Finmeccanica , British publisher Pearson which owns the Financial Times , and Belgian financial group Fortis , now known as Ageas . 
If the rebels win , Qatar would have a say in what the LIA does with its investments . 
`` Libya is not Iraq . 
You are unlikely to have a protracted civil war once it is over , '' said the western risk consultant who worked in Benghazi . 
`` So those investments are not like putting money at the bottom of a pit . 
It should pay back and also possibly give Qatar influence on what the LIA can invest money in . 
If we use takeover terminology , Qatar is exploring unrealised value . '' 
The Qataris see such rich pickings they have recently turned down opportunities elsewhere , according to a source close to the Qatar Investment Authority -LRB- QIA -RRB- , the country 's sovereign wealth fund . 
`` Qatar 's leaders are intensely focussed on sorting out the crisis in Libya , to the extent that they have passed on a few items over the past few months . '' 
A popular joke in Benghazi illustrates Qatari ambitions in Libya perfectly . 
What 's the new nickname of Qatari ruler Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani ? 
The Emir of Qatar and Libya . 
So why is an absolute monarchy , with little time for democracy at home , mixed up with a democratic rebellion ? 
Qatar 's foreign ministry has cited the U.N. resolution and the emir 's desire to alleviate the suffering of the Libyan people . 
`` The reasons as laid out as to why Qatar is acting do not quite seem to account for the huge risks and extraordinarily bold actions that Qatar is taking , '' said David Roberts , deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute based in Doha . 
`` I can only account for this apparent discrepancy by suggesting that this policy is being heavily pushed by Qatar 's elite . '' 
Rumours abound in Doha that the real reason for Qatar 's interest in Libya is that al-Thani 's wife Sheikha Mozah has close personal ties there , although her representatives declined to comment . 
`` Most of Qatar 's leadership , the al-Thanis and the sheikhs , know Libya very well , because they went to school with Libyans in the U.S. and the UK in the 70s and 80s , '' said Mahmoud Shammam , Doha-based spokesman for the rebels . 
`` So they know the situation there very well . 
They know the ugliness of the regime . '' 
Could Qatar also be working for Washington ? 
Before the war , U.S. companies had large investments in Libya , with majors ConocoPhillips and Marathon involved in direct production deals with Gaddafi 's Libyan National Oil Co. . 
Now consultants and deal-brokers in Benghazi are struck by the low numbers of American fixers relative to their European peers . 
`` To some extent they may be acting as a U.S. proxy . 
Washington wants to achieve things but does n't want to do it with its own hands , '' said a London-based risk consultant who has European firms as clients . 
Qatar hosts a large U.S. military base ; its decision to contribute planes to police the no-fly zone over Libya helped Washington argue that the western-led air strikes had Arab support . 
Its importance there was underscored by its ruler 's visit to Washington in April . 
`` We would not have been able , I think , to shape the kind of broad-based international coalition that includes not only our NATO members but also includes Arab states , without the emir 's leadership , '' U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters that month after meeting the emir in the Oval office . 
Diplomats also point to strains in U.S.-Saudi relations as proof of -- or perhaps even reason for -- improved ties between Washington and Qatar , pointing to events in Bahrain where U.S. calls for negotiation to end a recent uprising stood in stark contrast to Saudi Arabia 's decision to send in troops . 
Qatar 's stand is certainly appreciated by European countries , whose diplomats argue that the emirate is playing a smart multi-polar game . 
`` The Qataris are replacing the Saudis on certain agendas , '' said a French diplomat based in Europe . 
Qatar 's emir has twice been guest of honor at France 's annual Bastille Day parade since 2007 and the emirate has stakes in Airbus parent EADS , energy group EDF and construction firm Vinci . 
In 2008 , France also passed a law granting special tax exemptions to the emir and other Qatari investors who had bought property in Paris . 
BLOW TO QATARI RISK PROFILE Despite wide-ranging support in the West , Qatar 's actions in Libya have created unease among its neighbors . 
Qatar has long played the role of intermediary in the region . 
Though it is close to Washington and Saudi Arabia , it also has ties to Iran . 
Foreign firms , including almost all the world 's major oil companies , have invested tens of billions of dollars in projects with Qatar even though they know its gas reserves are , in effect , shared with Iran . 
The Iranian part is the South Pars field while the Qatari part is known as the North Field . 
The country 's Libya adventure increases the hazards again . 
`` The Qatari risk profile is changing significantly now due to Libya , whereas before they had been simply viewed as a stable and wealthy partner , '' the London-based British diplomat said . 
`` No doubt that foreign majors are taking notice of that . ''

2011-06-09,"MISRATA | Thu Jun 9 , 2011 12:39 am BST MISRATA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Western and Arab nations meet in Abu Dhabi on Thursday to focus on what one U.S. official called the `` end-game '' for Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi as NATO once again stepped up the intensity of its air raids on Tripoli . 
NATO air strikes resumed in Tripoli on Wednesday night after a lull that followed the heaviest day of bombings since March . 
Thousands of Gaddafi troops advanced on Misrata on Wednesday , shelling it from three sides and killing at least 12 rebels . 
Ministers from the so-called Libya contact group , including the United States , France and Britain , as well as Arab allies Qatar , Kuwait and Jordan , agreed in May to set up a fund to help the rebels in the civil war . 
They are expected to firm up this commitment in the United Arab Emirates capital and press the rebels to give a detailed plan on how they would run the country if Gaddafi stood down as leader of the oil producing North African desert state . 
`` The international community is beginning to talk about what could constitute end-game to this , '' one senior U.S. official told reporters aboard U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's plane which landed in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday night . 
`` That would obviously include some kind of cease-fire arrangement and some kind of political process ... and of course the question of Gaddafi and perhaps his family is also a key part of that , '' the U.S. official said . 
Both Libya 's rebel Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- and its Western allies have rejected Libyan government cease-fire offers that do not include Gaddafi 's departure , saying he and his family must relinquish power before any talks can begin . 
The U.S. official said there have been general discussions about what might happen to Gaddafi but nothing specific on `` where he should go , or whether he should remain in Libya for that matter . '' 
U.S. officials on Wednesday announced delivery of the TNC 's first U.S. oil sale , part of a broader strategy they hope will get money flowing to the cash starved group . 
U.S. oil refiner Tesoro announced in May it had purchased the 1.2 million barrel cargo , which U.S. officials said was due to arrive in Hawaii on Wednesday aboard a tanker chartered by Swiss oil trader Vitol . 
British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt , who will be at the Abu Dhabi talks , said the group would be briefed by the International Stabilisation Response Team which is helping the rebel council plan for post-conflict rebuilding . 
`` The contact group will also reiterate the unequivocal message ... that Gaddafi , his family and his regime have lost all legitimacy and must go so that the Libyan people can determine their own future , '' Burt said . 
`` Until Gaddafi does so , the pressure will increase across the board : economically , politically and militarily . '' 
NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday , but there were few signs of willingness to intensify their Libya mission , which after four months has failed to oust Gaddafi . 
The alliance says the bombing aims to protect civilians from the Libyan leader 's military , which crushed popular protests against his rule in February , leaving many dead . 
The conflict has now become a civil war . 
Gaddafi says the rebels are a minority of Islamist militants and the NATO campaign is an attempt to grab Libya 's oil . 
On the battlefront , forces loyal to Gaddafi were staging a big push on Misrata . 
`` He has sent thousands of troops from all sides and they are trying to enter the city . 
They are still outside , though , '' rebel spokesman Hassan al-Misrati told Reuters from inside the besieged town . 
Another rebel spokesman in Misrata , called Mohammed , told Reuters late on Wednesday they were still in control of the city despite the assault . 
Spain joined other Western and Arab governments in recognizing the Benghazi-based council as the sole representative of the Libyan people . 
Gaddafi troops and the rebels have been deadlocked for weeks , with neither side able to hold territory on a road between Ajdabiyah in the east , which Gaddafi forces shelled on Monday , and the Gaddafi-held oil town of Brega further west . 
Rebels control the east of Libya , the western city of Misrata and the range of western mountains near the border with Tunisia . 
They have been unable to advance on the capital against Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces .

2011-06-10,"CNN source says NATO believes the U.N. resolution on Libya justifies killing Moammar Gadhafi . 
NATO replies : `` We are simply not targeting individuals . '' 
NATO is trying to decide what to bomb first , Gadhafi 's army or the leader himself . 
Abu Dhabi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Night after night , day after day , NATO aircraft have hammered presidential compounds in Tripoli , Libya . 
I have walked over the piles of rubble . 
What I and my CNN colleagues have seen , particularly in recent days , gives additional credence to reporting by CNN 's counter terrorism analyst Fran Townsend that NATO 's leadership believes the U.N. resolution on Libya justifies killing the country 's leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
Townsend 's source , a senior NATO military official with knowledge of NATO 's Libyan operations , also implied more could be done to target Gadhafi . 
The comments drew a rapid response from a NATO spokeswoman , hinting at an internal rift within the organization over tactics . 
Libyan girl loses leg in rocket blast Timeline : NATO ramps up pressure on Libya `` We are targeting critical military capabilities that could be used to attack civilians , including command and control centers that could be used to plan and organize such attacks , '' spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said . 
`` We are simply not targeting individuals . '' 
Townsend 's source points out that Gadhafi commands Libya 's military and is at the center of its command and control . 
Gadhafi , as several diplomats noted at a Libya contact group meeting in Abu Dhabi on Thursday , is willing to watch his army get bombed into the dirt rather than quit . 
Indeed , just this week Gadhafi said in a radio address he would die rather than step down . 
What seems to up for debate at NATO is , with limited resources , what should it bomb first ? 
Should NATO go after Gadhafi 's army around rebel strongholds like Misrata , which wo n't do anything to remove the dictator ? 
Or should NATO relentlessly pursue the man himself , because the longer he is around the longer the war drags out and the bigger the final cost of picking up the pieces ? 
He warned NATO chiefs the alliance 's European partners are relying too heavily on the United States . 
`` The mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country -- yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions , requiring the U.S. , once more , to make up the difference , '' he said . 
The pointed language highlights the urgency of pursuing an end game -- getting Gadhafi and not his troops .

2011-06-10,"Malaak 's home caught up in attack by pro-Gadhafi forces on her neighborhood A rocket struck the house and exploded , injuring Malaak and killing her brother and sister Nonprofit group , Global Medical Relief Fund , may now help her travel to the U.S. for artificial limb Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five-year-old Malaak is having a bad day . 
People coming in and out of her room have interrupted her afternoon nap . 
`` What 's up with all these people ? 
It did not used to be that way , '' she said in a tone of voice laced with contempt . 
`` I used to be able to play and run around . 
Now these people disturb me . '' 
Malaak has every reason to be frustrated . 
For nearly a month she has been living , sleeping and eating in a hospital bed . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
her father asked , trying to soothe her . 
`` Dad , do not make me cry , '' she responded . 
`` I do not want to see anyone . 
I want to go home . 
I want to be able to play and run and do whatever I want . 
I do not want to feel any pain and want to leave . 
That 's it . '' 
Then she just stopped talking and drifted into one of her silent spells . 
NATO 's Rasmussen on Libyan endgame Clinton on Libya : ` Time is on our side ' Her mother said her mood swings have become more and more pronounced after what happened to her , her three-year-old brother Mohamed and one-year-old sister Rodayna in the safety of their own home in Misrata , Libya . 
On May 13 the three siblings had just lay down for an afternoon nap in their mother 's room . 
Suddenly their neighborhood -- controlled by rebels opposing Libya 's government -- came under attack by forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi . 
`` They all were lying in bed and I was next to them on the same bed but I left to clean up the house , '' the children 's mother , Saffiya Abdullah , explained . 
`` Less than a minute after that I heard the first Grad rocket falling and it seemed very close to our house so I ran back to hug them , pick them up and take them to safety , '' she added . 
Instead more missiles rained down and before she got to her room there was a deafening blast . 
The door to the room came crashing down on her as she struggled to find her children . 
A Grad rocket , which looks like an over-grown bullet about nine-feet long and 15 inches around , had slammed into her bedroom wall and exploded . 
It left a hole wide enough for two adults to push through at the same time . 
`` My clothes were burnt . 
A big part of the house was damaged and even my uncle 's house next door was damaged , '' Malaak said , without mentioning the worst of it . 
Malaak 's right leg was nearly torn off . 
Her left leg was broken , as was her arm . 
Her mother stood there in shock . 
Her younger son and daughter were n't breathing . 
`` I lifted them up one after the other , '' she said . 
`` I kept praying ; God make me patient . 
God make me patient . 
And I found Malaak alive but Mohamed and Rodayna looked dead . 
The two youngest children were dead . 
I want to travel to America and get a new leg then get right back here . 
`` A mother would want to die rather than see her babies die . '' 
Malaak was rushed to the hospital . 
Doctors said there was no question about what had to be done . 
`` It was gross . 
It was nearly totally amputated . 
It was just the skin and some muscles keeping the limb attached to the body , '' Dr. Ahmad Radwan said . 
Radwan , an Egyptian national who came to Libya as a volunteer with the Arab League , made the call . 
Malaak 's leg had to be amputated . 
He knew what it would mean to someone who had so much more life to live to wake up and find her leg gone . 
He also knew there were no prosthesis that would fit a child and she would be confined to a wheelchair . 
It was too much for him to bear . 
`` I could n't do it . 
I did it for young guys and for rebels at the frontlines but I could n't do it to Malaak , '' he said . 
He asked other doctors to take over . 
But Radwan has n't stopped fighting for her since the day he saw her being carried into the hospital . 
He called his fianc who knew someone at the nonprofit group Global Medical Relief Fund . 
The group 's mission is to aid children who are missing or have lost the use of limbs or eyes . 
In Malaak 's case that will likely mean she needs to travel to the United States to find help : a new leg to give her a better life . 
We visited Malaak in the hospital a second time . 
It was Tuesday afternoon and she was in a great mood , smiling , laughing and offering everyone chocolates . 
She is celebrating with her family , nurses and doctors . 
She has been told she must visit the hospital for more treatment but for the first time she can sleep at home . 
It is a relief , a wish come true . 
When her father asked what she wanted now , she replied : `` I want to travel to America and get a new leg then get right back here . 
That 's it . ''

2011-06-10,"By Fran Townsend , CNN National Security Contributor NATO ramps up pressure on Libya NATO spokeswoman says the alliance is not specifically targeting Gadhafi U.N. resolution applies to Gadhafi in his capacity as head of military , official says NATO last weekend employed helicopters against Gadhafi 's military assets Bombing began March 31 under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians during the fighting -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.N. resolution justifies the targeting of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , a senior NATO military official with operational knowledge of the Libya mission told CNN Thursday . 
The resolution applies to Gadhafi because , as head of the military , he is part of the control and command structure and therefore a legitimate target , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . 
The official was not authorized to talk to the media . 
Asked by CNN whether Gadhafi was being targeted , the NATO official declined to give a direct answer . 
But NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu disputed the claim , saying the alliance was not specifically targeting Gadhafi . 
`` We are targeting critical military capabilities that could be used to attack civilians , including command and control centers that could be used to plan and organize such attacks , '' Lungescu said . 
NATO responds to Gadhafi target reports NATO 's Rasmussen on Libyan endgame Libyan girl loses leg in rocket blast Clinton on Libya : ` Time is on our side ' `` We are simply not targeting individuals , '' she said , but noted on CNN 's American Morning that those military capabilities are the `` nerve center of Gadhafi 's kill chain . 
The war machine that has been consistently attacking , relentlessly attacking and systematically attacking civilians in Libya . '' 
`` We 've seen just the other day in Misrata that sort of indiscriminate shelling is still continuing . 
So the Gadhafi regime still poses a threat to its own people . '' 
NATO has been ramping up pressure on the regime , employing helicopters last weekend for the first time against Gadhafi 's forces . 
Explosions are heard often in Tripoli , evidence of allied air strikes . 
NATO intervened in March in the months-long civil war under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians as Gadhafi tried to crush the revolt against him . 
The resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council authorized `` all necessary measures , '' with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . 
NATO 's goal is to end attacks against civilians , the withdrawal of Gadhafi forces to barracks and bases , and full humanitarian access , Lungescu said . 
`` There is , of course , a political track and that is what has been going on with the Contact Group in Abu Dhabi , '' she said , referring to the Thursday meeting of world powers focused on the Libyan crisis . 
The group bolstered financial and moral support for the Libyan opposition there and focused on sustaining pressure on Gadhafi . 
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Wednesday it is time to start planning for what to do in Libya after Gadhafi 's departure `` because Gadhafi 's reign of terror is coming to an end . '' 
But Gadhafi has refused to step down , going so far this week as to do a live audio broadcast as NATO warplanes bombed his Tripoli compound . 
`` We will not surrender , '' he said during Tuesday 's broadcast . 
NATO recently announced its decision to extend its mission in Libya by 90 days . 
CNN 's Eve Bower contributed to this report .

2011-06-10,"BENGHAZI | Fri Jun 10 , 2011 6:26 pm EDT BENGHAZI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Heavy fighting between pro-Gaddafi troops and rebels broke out in a Libyan city just 160 kilometres east of Tripoli , potentially opening the coastal road to the capital , just as cracks appeared among NATO allies . 
Gaddafi forces also shelled for the first time the world heritage-listed city of Gadamis , some 600 kilometres southwest of the capital on the Tunisia and Algerian border , opening a new front in the five-month long civil war . 
World powers gave mixed signals on how the deadlocked civil war might play out , with Russia trying to mediate reconciliation . 
Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday he had offered a `` guarantee '' to Gaddafi if he left Libya , but received no reply . 
With diplomacy stalling , rebels said fighting was erupting on new fronts . 
Ahmed Bani , a military spokesman in Benghazi , told Reuters clashes had broken out in Zlitan on Thursday and resumed on Friday with Gaddafi forces killing 22 rebels . 
Zlitan is one of three towns that are under government control between the rebel-held Misrata and the capital and were it to fall could act as a stepping stone to allow the anti-Gaddafi uprising to spread from Misrata , the biggest rebel outpost in western Libya , to Gaddafi 's stronghold in Tripoli . 
`` Large numbers of troops are surrounding Zlitan from all directions and are threatening its residents with having their women raped by mercenaries if they do not surrender , '' Bani said , adding the rebels controlled parts of the city . 
Rebels also said the oasis town of Gadamis with a population of about 7,000 people , mainly Berber , was under attack after an anti-government protest in the old Roman city on Wednesday . 
`` Gadamis is being shelled by Gaddafi forces , according to witnesses in the town , '' spokesman Juma Ibrahim said from the rebel-held town of Zintan in the Western Mountains region . 
`` This is a retaliation to anti-regime protests , '' he said . 
The old town was de-populated by Gaddafi in the 1990s and its inhabitants moved into modern buildings . 
It was not clear if the attack targeted the old town , a labyrinth of narrow , underground passages and houses known as the `` Pearl of the Desert . '' 
The accounts in Zlitan and Gadamis could not be independently verified and the Gaddafi government did not immediately comment . 
In the besieged port city of Misrata , a doctor at the Hekma hospital said 31 people were killed and 110 wounded in government shelling on Friday . 
The fighting comes after the United States accused some NATO allies on Friday of failing to pull their weight in the campaign against Muammar Gaddafi 's forces , as the Libyan leader kept up shelling of the rebel-held town of Misrata . 
`` The mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly-armed regime in a sparsely-populated country -- yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions , requiring the U.S. , once more , to make up the difference , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a valedictory speech at NATO headquarters in Brussels . 
Gates 's exasperation has been echoed by rebels , who control the east of the country and some other areas but do not appear to pose an imminent threat to Gaddafi 's rule . 
Turkey , which is a member of NATO , said Gaddafi had no way out , but to leave Libya and offered the him an exit . 
`` We ourselves have offered him this guarantee , via the representatives we 've sent . 
We told him we would help him to be sent wherever he wanted to be sent . 
We would discuss the issue with our allies , according to the response we receive . 
Unfortunately we still have n't got a response from Gaddafi . '' 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , appearing at the Abu Dhabi meeting of the Libya contact group on Thursday , said talks were under way with people close to Gaddafi who had raised the `` potential '' for a transition of power but added : `` There is not any clear way forward yet . '' 
Under pressure to come up with plans for a transitional government while still in disarray , the rebels have said the onus is on foreign powers to hasten assistance . 
`` Our people are dying , '' rebel Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said . 
`` So my message to our friends is that I hope they walk the walk . '' 
Gaddafi describes the rebels as al Qaeda terrorists and says foreign intervention is a front for a grab at the country 's oil . 
Mikhail Margelov , Russia 's Africa envoy , who traveled to Benghazi on Friday , said he would go to Tripoli as soon as NATO provided a corridor through its Libyan no-fly zone . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
They are killing civilians maybe more than Gaddafi . 
They have more arsenal than Gaddafi and have all air power , Gaddafi has none . 
They are now aided with Money with a more ONE LOPSIDEDNESS cause than before . 
You better believe that NO ONE would be leaving Gaddafi to stand alone if NATO was not there for the rebels . 
People only leave Gaddafi only because there is only one outcome from this awesome one sided unjustified intervention by NATO and the us . 
NATO has tied Gaddafi 's hands behind his back , plucked out his eyes and are aiding the rebels against the crippled Gaddafi . 
NATO should be exposed for what they are , immoral cowards . 
`` At the United Nations , the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- said its investigators had found evidence linking Gaddafi to a policy of raping opponents . '' 
As is commented below , in an apparent defense of Gaddafi , as to the NATO alliance , `` They are killing civilians \* maybe more \* than Gaddafi . '' 
all the way round . 
Love living in this world ? 
= -RRB- Daniwitz ... where do you have any proof NATO has killed even a fraction of the people Gaddafi has . 
This is an insane mass murderer . 
It is scary to see your support for a regime that has absolutely no regard for life . 
In fact , most of the images from Gaddafi have turned out to be false as is the case with most everything he says . 
Hopefully , the ICC will eventually have him so he can receive his due justice !

2011-06-10,"GENEVA | Fri Jun 10 , 2011 5:07 pm BST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rape is still being used as a brutal weapon of war in conflicts worldwide including Libya to terrorise populations and often force civilians to flee , a United Nations expert charged Friday . 
Most perpetrators go unpunished as sexual violence thrives in a climate of impunity where victims are denied justice or reparations , said Margot Wallstrom , special representative of the U.N. Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict . 
`` Sexual violence has become a tactic of choice for armed groups , being cheaper , more destructive and easier to get away with than other methods of warfare , '' she told a news briefing . 
Wallstrom , making her first speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council since taking up the post in March 2010 , called for all countries caught up in conflict to prevent such war crimes and prosecute soldiers or commanders under suspicion . 
`` Violence against women is no more permissible in times of war than it is in times of peace . 
And yet , in contemporary conflicts , women and girls are the primary targets of sexual violence , including as a tactic of war , '' she told the forum . 
Her office is drawing up a blacklist to ` name and shame ' states who may be subject to Security Council sanctions , under a resolution adopted last December , according to Wallstrom . 
It will probably start with Democratic Republic of the Congo , where at least 200,000 women and girls have been abused , although some estimates are 20 times that figure , she said . 
In Liberia , which is recovering from 14 years of intermittent civil war in which rape was rampant , it is still the most reported crime , she said . 
International Criminal Court investigators have evidence linking Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to a policy of raping opponents and may bring separate charges on the issue , ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Wednesday . 
Cherif Bassiouni , head of a U.N. rights inquiry which went to areas controlled by both rebels and Gaddafi , appeared to cast doubt on the ICC report Thursday , although his team 's report accused government forces of murder , torture and abduction . 
Bassiouni said each side had accused the other of deploying fighters armed with impotency drugs to carry out rapes , creating what he called a `` massive hysteria '' in Libya . 
His team uncovered only four alleged cases -- Eman Al-Obaidi who claimed she was gang-raped by pro-government militiamen and three women in Misrata who said they had been sexually abused . 
`` Can we draw a conclusion that there is a systematic policy of rape ? 
In my opinion we ca n't , '' Bassiouni said . 
`` For the time being , the numbers are very limited . '' 
But Wallstrom , a former Swedish minister , said information collected by her office backed Moreno-Ocampo 's view . 
`` Everything we see and hear reported points to that , '' she told reporters . 
`` What we have is consistent reports from people , from organizations , from U.N. entities and others on the ground , '' she added . 
`` It is difficult to give you a figure , but this is part of the arsenal , the weaponry that Gaddafi 's troops use . '' 
Sharia-inspired laws in Libya and Sudan that can be used to punish a rape victim should be scrapped , Wallstrom said . 
`` I understand in their -LRB- Libyan -RRB- legislation for example , you could be flogged . 
Very often women who report rape can themselves be accused of adultery or risk this kind of punishment , '' she said , adding that Sudan allows stoning . 
Political leaders must ensure that laws are modern and women do not run a risk in just reporting a rape , she said . 
`` That is what they all have to look at so it is not stone-age legislation as well that will prevent women from actually coming forward . 
They will never get the reports on rape if this is the risk that women run . ''

2011-06-11,"A rebel fighter stands guard at a checkpoint to the entrance of Derna district , 30 km -LRB- 19 miles -RRB- east of the rebel-held city of Benghazi , June 11 , 2011 . 
ZAWIYAH , Libya | Sat Jun 11 , 2011 5:08 pm EDT ZAWIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fought gun battles with rebels in the town of Zawiyah Saturday , witnesses said , shutting the coastal highway that links the capital Tripoli with Tunisia . 
Two Reuters reporters traveling via the town , which lies just 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- outside of Tripoli , on two separate trips six hours apart , were diverted via backstreets with a police escort while the fighting raged on . 
They said the highway was deserted except for lots of soldiers , police and armed men in civilian clothes . 
One heard bursts of gunfire coming from the direction of the city . 
`` The situation is very bad in Zawiyah . 
There 's been fierce fighting since the morning , '' said the resident , who gave only his first name , Mohammed , fearing reprisals . 
Four months since Gaddafi 's forces crushed a popular uprising against his four-decade rule that then morphed into an armed rebellion , Libya 's civil war is in stalemate . 
Nearly three months of bombings by NATO war planes against Libyan military targets have failed to unseat Gaddafi or enable the rebels to launch an offensive on his territory in Tripoli . 
Several explosions were heard in Tripoli throughout the afternoon , as late as 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. ET -RRB- , suggesting NATO was ramping up attacks after a quiet morning . 
Libya TV reported that `` the imperialist aggressors '' had bombed several sites in and around the Libyan capital , in the town of Yafran , then showed footage of what it said were children wounded in past NATO bombings , to violin music . 
Rebel spokesman Ahmed Bani said a senior Gaddafi aide had been wounded in a NATO strike on a city close to Tripoli on Saturday evening and was in hospital . 
There was no independent confirmation and Libyan officials were not available to comment . 
The rebels control the east of Libya , the western city of Misrata and the range of mountains near the border with Tunisia . 
They are seeking to encircle the capital and cut it off , an aim that would be advanced if they manage to capture Zawiyah . 
The highway has been used throughout the conflict by Gaddafi 's officials -- including fleeing defectors -- to reach the outside world , and by trucks bringing in food and other supplies to territory under Gaddafi 's control . 
After a lull in fighting in the western , rebel-held city of Misrata , pro-Gaddafi forces which have besieging it started shelling its port late Saturday , Al Jazeera TV reported . 
A doctor at the Hekma hospital said 31 people were killed and 110 wounded in shelling by Gaddafi forces Friday . 
Pro-Gaddafi troops encircled the city of Zlitan , 160 km east of Tripoli , Saturday , rebels said , after fighting broke out there that could also open up the coastal road to the capital . 
Some clashes between Gaddafi 's forces and rebels continued in the city , rebel spokesman Bani said , after the rebels took some parts of it . 
The toll remained 22 rebels killed . 
Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim played down the clashes . 
`` There is no serious fighting going on in Zawiya or Zlitan . 
What has happened is that we 've had small groups of rebels who have made their way from Zintan and the Western Mountains to cause trouble in these areas , '' he told Reuters . 
Zlitan is one of three towns that are largely government controlled between the rebel-held Misrata and the capital . 
Were it to fall , it could allow the anti-Gaddafi uprising to spread from Misrata , the biggest rebel outpost in western Libya , to Gaddafi 's stronghold in Tripoli . 
World powers have given mixed signals on how the war might play out , with Russia trying to mediate reconciliation . 
Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said Friday he had offered a `` guarantee '' to Gaddafi if he left Libya , but received no reply . 
Gaddafi has refused to step down , describing the rebels as al Qaeda terrorists and Western intervention as an oil grab . 
As diplomacy falters , several new battle fronts have opened . 
Gaddafi 's forces also shelled for the first time the UNESCO world heritage-listed city of Ghadames , 600 km -LRB- 370 miles -RRB- southwest of Tripoli , on the Tunisia and Algeria borders , overnight , opening a new front in the war , rebels said . 
Rebels said the oasis town , with a population of about 7,000 people , mainly Berber , was under attack after an anti-government protest in the old Roman city Wednesday . 
`` This is a retaliation for anti-regime protests , '' spokesman Juma Ibrahim said from the rebel-held town of Zintan . 
The report could not be independently verified . 
The old town was de-populated by Gaddafi in the 1990s and its inhabitants moved into modern buildings . 
It was not clear if the attack hit the old town , a labyrinth of narrow , underground passages and houses known as the `` Pearl of the Desert . '' 
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday some NATO allies of failing to pull their weight : `` The mightiest military alliance in history was only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country -- yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions , '' he said . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Why would they want to protect this guy ? 
Brazilian1 : by offering Gaddafi a way for him and his family to get out of Libya and live comfortably in Turkey , they hope to end the war immediately . 
But after what happened in Egypt , it is much less likely that Gaddafi or any other dictator will take such a deal . 
Remember , Gaddafi only lives acts to benefit himself and his friends . 
Libya is just his piggy bank . 
Do n't get me wrong , I believe in what NATO is doing to remove Gaddafi from power . 
Ca n't someone explain to me a NATO statement that the Gaddafi 's side is running out of supplies -LRB- Food , Fuel , and medicine -RRB- and it should only be a matter of weeks until they have no more . 
Then I read this artical above and it has this statement ; `` The highway has been used throughout the four-month-old conflict by Gaddafi 's officials -- including fleeing defectors -- to reach the outside world , and by trucks bringing in food and other supplies to territory under Gaddafi 's control '' .

2011-06-14,"NATO can not verify rebel claims that Gadhafi may be hiding rockets at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Leptis Magna . 
The president of South Africa lashed out Tuesday at NATO 's enforcement of the U.N. resolution authorizing the organization to act to protect innocent civilians threatened by Libya 's civil war . 
`` We strongly believe that the resolution is being abused for regime change , political assassinations and foreign military occupation , '' said Jacob Zuma at a budget vote debate before the National Assembly in Cape Town . 
`` These actions undermine the efforts of the African Union in finding solutions to the problems facing its member states , '' he said in an appeal that called on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and called further for reform of the U.N. Security Council . 
When the council adopted the resolution in March , it was backed by the Arab League and supported by African countries in the council . 
But Zuma said NATO 's actions have exceeded the authority that the resolution granted . 
Arab Spring unrest , country by country `` We have spoken out against the misuse of the good intentions in Resolution 1973 , '' said Zuma , who led two African Union delegations to Libya , where he met with leader Moammar Gadhafi in failed attempts to broker a cease-fire . 
Unlike some other world leaders , Zuma has not called for the longtime leader to step down . 
Neither has Zuma 's African National Congress party nor the African Union , which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led . 
The AU also has criticized the NATO airstrikes . 
In April , Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli , Libya 's capital , where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed , in principle , to the AU 's `` road map '' proposal for peace . 
But Gadhafi continued his attacks and the Libyan opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years . 
U.S. officials and those of some other countries have called for Gadhafi to step down . 
Separately , NATO refused to say Tuesday whether it would bomb ancient Roman ruins in Libya if it knew Gadhafi was hiding military equipment there . 
Time magazine gallery : Libya 's stunning Roman ruins `` We will strike military vehicles , military forces , military equipment or military infrastructure that threaten Libyan civilians as necessary , '' a NATO official in Naples , Italy , said , declining to give his name in discussing internal NATO deliberations .

2011-06-15,"By the CNN Wire Staff Congressmen challenge Obama on Libya NEW : Report says Obama does not risk violating the War Powers Act NEW : Boehner spokesman says Obama 's `` creative arguments '' raise a number of questions Kucinich to the Obama administration : `` Tell it to the judge '' U.S. officials say the limited U.S. role in Libya falls short of the law 's scope Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The White House defended to Congress on Wednesday the legality , the costs and accomplishments of the U.S. military mission in Libya . 
In a 32-page report titled `` United States Activities in Libya , '' the administration says the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $ 800 million . 
It estimates the total cost through September 30 will be $ 1.1 billion . 
The report was drawn up in response to a House resolution that accused President Barack Obama of failing to consult with Congress over the military effort in the North African country . 
It denies the accusation by some members of Congress that Obama has violated the War Powers Resolution by intervening militarily for more than 60 days without seeking approval from Congress . 
`` Given the important U.S. interests served by U.S. military operations in Libya and the limited nature , scope and duration of the anticipated actions , the president had constitutional authority , as commander-in-chief and chief executive and pursuant to his foreign affairs powers , to address such limited military operations abroad , '' it says . 
`` The president is of the view that the current U.S. military operations in Libya are consistent with the War Powers Resolution and do not under that law require further congressional authorization , because U.S. military operations are distinct from the kind of ` hostilities ' contemplated by the resolution 's 60-day termination provision . '' 
The report was accompanied by a two-page letter jointly signed by legislative affairs officials with the departments of Defense and State and directed to House Speaker John Boehner . 
Rep. Frank ` disappointed ' in Obama Kucinich : If it looks like war , it 's war `` Taken in response to direct appeals from the Libyan people , and acting with a mandate from the United Nations , the United States mobilized a broad coalition , stopped an advancing army , prevented a massacre , established a no-fly zone , and limited the spread of violence and instability in a region pivotal to U.S. security interests , '' it says . 
In response , Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said , `` The creative arguments made by the White House raise a number of questions that must be further explored . 
Regardless , the commander-in-chief has a responsibility to articulate how U.S. military action is vital to our national security and consistent with American policy goals . 
With Libya , the president has fallen short on this obligation . 
We will review the information that was provided today but hope and expect that this will serve as the beginning , not the end , of the president 's explanation for continued American operations in Libya . '' 
The exchange of documents came after a bipartisan group of House members filed a lawsuit Wednesday that challenges U.S. participation in the Libya military mission . 
Boehner , R-Ohio , said in a letter to Obama on Tuesday that the administration could be in violation of the War Powers Resolution , if it fails to get congressional authorization by Sunday , the 90th day since the mission began and a deadline that some legal experts cite as the deadline set by the resolution . 
The lawsuit addresses a long-standing dispute between the executive and legislative branches -- meaning the White House and Congress -- over the powers of the president to send forces to war . 
`` We are intending through our presence and through this lawsuit to correct an imbalance which exists today , to correct a deficiency in the separation of powers , to correct ... and to firmly establish that Congress is a co-equal branch of government and that the founders made it unmistakably clear they did not intend for the war power to be placed in the hands of an executive , '' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , an anti-war liberal and one of the 10 legislators filing the lawsuit . 
Rep. Tim Johnson , R-Illinois , said the legal issue was whether Obama exceeded his authority in committing U.S. forces to the Libya mission . 
`` Did he act illegally ? 
The answer is yes , '' Johnson said . 
But Wednesday 's report from the White House say that U.S. operations are limited to a supporting role in a coalition whose operations are authorized by the U.N. Security Council resolution . 
They `` do not involve sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces , nor do they involve the presence of U.S. ground troops , U.S. casualties or a serious threat thereof , or any significant chance of escalation into a conflict characterized by those factors . '' 
In a letter to Boehner and to the president pro tempore of the Senate , Daniel Inouye of Hawaii , Obama called U.S. support for the NATO-based coalition `` crucial to assuring the success of international efforts to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas from the actions of the Gadhafi regime , and to address the threat to international peace and security posed by the crisis in Libya . '' 
He noted that no U.S. ground forces have been deployed , except for operations to rescue the crew of a U.S. aircraft on March 21 . 
But Kucinich said earlier in the day that the Obama administration must make its case in court . 
`` They can tell it to the judge now , '' Kucinich said . 
`` They ca n't claim this is n't a war . '' 
The lawsuit asks the court to `` declare that the war in Libya is illegal and order the White House to stop . '' 
The goal of the administration and legislators who support the Libya mission is approval of a new resolution that backs U.S. participation , which would serve as an equivalent to congressional authorization . 
The White House has said it was complying with the War Powers Resolution through frequent briefings on the Libya mission , and Wednesday 's report cited dozens of them . 
Boehner 's letter contested that assertion . 
`` Since the mission began , the administration has provided tactical operational briefings to the House of Representatives , but the White House has systematically avoided requesting a formal authorization for its action , '' Boehner 's letter said . 
`` It has simultaneously sought , however , to portray that its actions are consistent with the War Powers Resolution . 
The combination of these actions has left many members of Congress , as well as the American people , frustrated by the lack of clarity over the administration 's strategic policies , by a refusal to acknowledge and respect the role of the Congress , and by a refusal to comply with the basic tenets of the War Powers Resolution . '' 
Such political wrangling over war powers is common in Washington , with presidents frequently seeking to expand their freedom to commit U.S. forces and Congress battling to exert influence on the process . 
Congressional opponents of the mission say that its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated U.S. goal of Moammar Gadhafi 's resignation or ouster and that the Libya situation could become a stalemate . 
The White House says incremental progress is occurring through increasing diplomatic , political and military pressure on Gadhafi to step down . 
In a coincidence of scheduling , Obama and Boehner are set to play golf together for the first time Saturday , a day after Boehner 's deadline for information from the administration and the day before he says it could be in violation of the War Powers Resolution .

2011-06-15,"LONDON | Wed Jun 15 , 2011 3:36 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - NATO risks sliding into a ground war in Libya and is trying to kill its leader , Muammar Gaddafi , Russia 's ambassador to the alliance said on Wednesday . 
Dmitry Rogozin also said the conflict could have dire consequences for Europe by stoking hatred of the West . 
`` It is our observation that NATO is sliding down and being dragged more and more into the eventuality of a land-based operation in Libya , '' he told a news conference during a visit to London . 
Asked if he believed NATO was trying to assassinate Gaddafi , Rogozin said : `` Well yes . 
Your chief of defense has declared Gaddafi 's assassination as an eventual target . '' 
He was apparently referring to a suggestion in March by British Defense Secretary Liam Fox , later contradicted by other officials , that killing Gaddafi was a possible option . 
Rogozin , speaking through an interpreter , said NATO was choosing targets and then declaring them to be legitimate . 
`` If Gaddafi or some people close to him sent a fax from some building in Libya , than immediately that building is declared as a military target , '' he said . 
NATO , armed with a U.N. resolution authorizing a no-fly zone over Libya , has been striking Libyan targets for nearly three months with the aim of protecting civilians from attack by Gaddafi 's forces . 
Russia , which abstained in the March U.N. Security Council vote authorizing military intervention , has accused the Western coalition of going beyond its mandate . 
The U.N. resolution bars an occupation force in Libya and Britain has ruled out a ground invasion . 
However , some politicians see France and Britain 's deployment of attack helicopters as an escalation of their involvement . 
The military intervention in Libya was very dangerous , Rogozin said , asking if Britain had not had enough war in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
`` What is happening in Tripoli is a real civil war and it is complicated by the inter-tribe contradictions and to intervene in this situation will mean to confuse this conflict and to exacerbate the situation even more , '' he said . 
`` It will lead up to the internationalization of this conflict with all the consequences for Europe in terms of extremism in Europe and hatred for the West ... Do you really want that ? '' 
Russia is attempting to mediate in the fighting . 
Moscow 's Africa envoy Mikhail Margelov met Libyan rebel leaders in Benghazi and a cousin of Gaddafi in Cairo last week and plans to travel to Tripoli soon to meet members of Gaddafi 's government . 
We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
The Russian has a point . 
Nato will soon have boots on the ground to ensure its side wins the civil war , and , I might add , then takes control of Libya 's vast oil fields in a barely disguised effort keep the partially bankrupt European Union from collapsing . 
How strange is it that now it 's France and the UK beating the drums of war and it 's Russia and America that are trying to talk common sense . 
I suppose it 's not surprising that France wants to flex its muscle in Africa since it plays its hand in all the former French colonies , but I 'm amazed that the UK could really be so hawkish -- especially in light of the draconian austerity they 've impose on their own people . 
That 's all the West needs to know .

2011-06-15,"RABAT , June 15 | Wed Jun 15 , 2011 10:29 pm BST RABAT , June 15 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's government approved a $ 31.4 billion budget for the rest of 2011 , the official news agency said on Wednesday , a move apparently aimed at showing it was functioning as normal despite air strikes and sanctions . 
Jana said the funds would `` provide the necessary financial sources to cover the state 's expenditure for the rest of the year '' and would be distributed to the country 's 22 districts . 
It said just under half of the total 37.65 billion dinars -LRB- $ 31.4 billion -RRB- would be used to pay salaries . 
It appeared to be an attempt by Muammar Gaddafi to show his government was still solvent despite a civil war pitting his forces against rebels looking to end his 41-year rule . 
Libya 's former central bank governor Farhat Bengdara , who defected in March was quoted this week , as saying the Gaddafi government had just $ 500 million left in cash at the end of February , although it still held about 155 tonnes of gold bars . 
An International Monetary Fund report put Libya 's net foreign assets held by the central bank and the sovereign wealth fund at $ 150 billion at the end of 2010 . 
Some of these assets were abroad and have been seized as part of sanctions against Libya . 
That still leaves Gaddafi with a large pile of currency , but with no new foreign exchange coming in from the sale of oil -- which is also blocked by sanctions -- those reserves will dwindle .

2011-06-15,"Britain 's Ambassador to the U.N. Mark Lyall Grant addresses a news conference at the United Nations offices at Gigiri in Kenya 's capital Nairobi , May 25 , 2011 . 
UNITED NATIONS | Wed Jun 15 , 2011 11:32 pm BST UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.N. Security Council permanent member Britain urged the African Union on Wednesday to send a strong message that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi must step down if civil war is to end in the North African state . 
Britain 's U.N. ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told the grouping it should subordinate its peace efforts in Libya to those of the United Nations and that there could be no cease-fire as long as Gaddafi remained in power . 
Lyall Grant 's statement at a Security Council meeting with the AU came a day after South African President Jacob Zuma , who has visited Libya twice for the bloc to seek a solution to the conflict , said NATO military action there had gone too far . 
In a speech to the council earlier on Wednesday , an AU representative called for an `` immediate humanitarian pause '' to allow relief supplies to reach Libyan civilians , followed by a cease-fire linked to political negotiations on a settlement . 
Following the speech by Mauritanian Foreign Minister Hamady Ould Hamady , the council and an AU delegation held a closed meeting where Lyall Grant defended NATO bombing of Gaddafi 's forces in pursuit of a council resolution calling for Libyan civilians to be protected . 
`` Gaddafi continues to launch attacks against his own people . 
So long as he continues to do so , the coalition will take action to enforce the Security Council 's resolutions , '' Lyall Grant said in a text issued by Britain 's U.N. mission . 
Since the latest resolution was passed on March 17 , the United States , Britain and France have played a leading role in attacking Gaddafi 's troops fighting against rebels who hold the east of the country . 
Lyall Grant said the AU had a `` central role '' to play in Libya peace efforts , but it must be `` coordinated with , and led by , the United Nations , '' under U.N. special envoy for Libya Abdelilah al-Khatib . 
`` It is important that parallel negotiation tracks do not open up , otherwise there will be a very real risk that Gaddafi will seek to exploit any perceived divisions in the international approach , which could inadvertently prolong the conflict , '' he said . 
`` Many African countries ... recognize the need for Gaddafi 's departure . 
We hope that this can translate into a strong message from the African Union to the regime . '' 
Lyall Grant , whose audience included South African Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane , made no direct reference to Zuma , whose last visit to Libya late last month was inconclusive . 
Zuma has said Gaddafi wants an end to NATO bombing as a prelude to talks , terms the rebels reject . 
`` It is clear that a cease-fire with Gaddafi in place would not be credible , '' the British envoy said . 
`` Gaddafi has already declared a number of ceasefires , and he has broken every one of them . '' 
Since March , the Security Council has lost unanimity over Libya . 
Permanent members Russia and China believe , like Zuma , that the NATO bombing has exceeded the authority given by the resolution and aims at regime change in Libya .

2011-06-17,"CNN sees a video showing a woman being abused by two men CNN can not confirm when or where the video was shot Rebels and experts claim pro-Gadhafi forces are raping and torturing The stigma of the brutality has reportedly led a rebel commander to erase evidence Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the front lines of Libya 's war , rebel fighters say they are finding more than weapons on captured or killed soldiers loyal to ruler Moammar Gadhafi . 
Rebels say they have confiscated cell phones that contain video showing Gadhafi loyalists raping women and torturing people . 
CNN has obtained a copy of a video shot on a cell phone that appears to show a woman being sexually abused . 
The person who gave the video to CNN says it was on a cell phone that was confiscated from a Gadhafi loyalist . 
It shows two men in civilian clothes standing over a naked woman who is bent over with her face on the floor . 
The man standing behind her is sodomizing her with what appears to be a broomstick . 
`` I ca n't bear it ! 
I ca n't bear it ! '' 
`` Let 's push it farther , '' a male voice says off-camera . 
`` No , no , that 's enough ! '' 
Eventually , one of the men puts his sock-covered foot on her face . 
In Arab culture , that is considered a major insult . 
But in this case , it pales in comparison to what the victim is already enduring . 
Arabic speakers who listened to the video at CNN 's request say the voices have Tripoli accents . 
There is no date on the video and the men in it are not wearing military uniforms . 
CNN has been unable to verify the video 's authenticity , when it was shot , or by whom . 
The person who gave it to CNN asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by Libya 's conservative society . 
The Gadhafi government did not respond to CNN requests for comment on the allegations of abuse . 
But officials have said in response to similar accusations in the past that the government has not been able to verify the claims and would `` welcome '' a fact-finding mission . 
We were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war because it was systematic . 
An opposition spokesman says the video illustrates a pattern of abuse . 
`` We were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war , because it was systematic , '' rebel spokesman Abdullah al-Kabeir said . 
The rebels have many videos showing other types of torture , and a few depict rape , he said . 
He did not know exactly how many videos there were showing abuse . 
One of the most famous faces of Libya 's revolution , Eman al-Obeidy , dramatically claimed in March she had been gang-raped by pro-Gadhafi forces . 
She has since fled the country . 
A Libyan psychologist who has conducted an investigation of her own says al-Obeidy 's case is not unique . 
Siham Sergewa says she has evidence of hundreds of cases of rape by pro-Gadhafi troops . 
She began her investigation after receiving phone calls from women who said they had been sexually assaulted . 
Her survey of 50,000 people in refugee camps turned up 259 people who said they had been raped , she said last month . 
`` They tie up my husband , they rape me in front of my husband and then they kill my husband , '' Sergewa said one woman told her . 
`` I 'm a psychologist and I 've seen lots of things , really . 
But sometimes after I leave some of these families I just sit in my car and cry because it 's really so painful , '' she said . 
She has compiled a number of distressing images that she says demonstrate the abuse of alleged victims . 
One appears to show a cigarette burn on a woman 's breast , another a faded bite mark , while several others show the deep purple hue of nasty bruises . 
Sergewa shared her research , complete with pictures and recordings , with the International Criminal Court at The Hague , Netherlands , where prosecutors are investigating accusations that the Gadhafi regime has used rape as a tool of war . 
`` The victims are starting to come out , '' the court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , told CNN Thursday . 
`` But in our court the crimes are massive and the crimes we are charging Gadhafi with are crimes against humanity , meaning a widespread and systematic attack -- in this case through rapes -- so we do n't need to prove one case ; we need to prove massive numbers of cases . 
`` In this case , the evidence can be different . 
It could be soldiers who were given instructions on how to do it . 
The evidence could be doctors or psychologists who have spoken to the victims . 
That 's the kind of evidence we are collecting . '' 
The court is still in the evidence-collecting stage , he said . 
For the video to be part of that evidence , its authenticity would have to be certified , he said . 
`` These are interesting pieces , but it is n't the only way to put forward the case . 
For instance , we have some information of people saying that Gadhafi himself was giving instructions . 
So if we can confirm this evidence , that will be enough to present this type of case as a crime against humanity -- as a widespread campaign of rapes . '' 
Moreno-Ocampo said he was hoping the judge would soon issue an arrest warrant for Gadhafi . 
`` And then the challenge will be to arrest him , because arresting him will be the end to these crimes , '' he said . 
Rebel spokesman al-Kabeir , however , said some of the evidence of war crimes that prosecutors want to present in court has been destroyed by a rebel leader . 
`` There was a commander here at the eastern front in Misrata named Mohamed al-Halboos ; he ordered all the -LRB- rebel -RRB- fighters to give him all the rape videos they find on Gadhafi soldiers ' cell phones . 
I heard that he used to destroy every rape video he got , '' al-Kabeir said . 
Asked why potential evidence of war crimes being carried out by pro-Gadhafi forces would be destroyed by rebel forces , he cited the heavy stigma that Libyan culture attaches to the victims of such crimes . 
`` Aside from being a heinous crime , rape is perceived here in our culture as damaging not only for the girl , but also the whole family , '' he said . 
In fact , he added , rape is such a taboo here that some victims ' families would rather erase potential evidence than risk living with the shame . 
In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was `` deeply concerned '' over the reports of wide-scale rape in Libya . 
`` A thorough investigation of this matter is needed to bring perpetrators to justice , '' she said in a statement . 
`` Gadhafi 's security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war , and the United States condemns this in the strongest possible terms . ''

"
2011-06-17,"By Stephan Richter -- Special to CNN Seemingly all the major U.S. newspapers , including the New York Times and Washington Post , are editorializing harshly that NATO -LRB- read : Europe -RRB- shows itself a complete failure in Libya . 
It acts too slowly , with too little force and proves shamefully dependent on U.S. firepower . 
Following on the heels of U.S. Secretary of Defense Bob Gates ' stern warning about the future of NATO , such displays of what increasingly seems like self-righteous indignation were to be expected . 
To be sure , the European response to Libya leaves much to be desired . 
And yet , I wonder : Imagine the Europeans had brought to bear all the firepower imaginable and had done so rapidly . 
Would the world be better off ? 
The answer is not a matter of conjecture and speculation , but of hard evidence because there is a relevant precedent : Iraq . 
The key question that needs to be asked is : Just what has shock and awe brought us in Iraq ? 
Or in Afghanistan for that matter ? 
The evidence is that even the best-resourced military the world has ever known , rife with its impressive hell-from-the-sky and boots-on-the-ground skills , has not succeeded where it moved fast , in Iraq . 
Hundreds of billions of dollars and a decade later , the United States is likely to have very little to show for its interventions , especially considering the human lives lost and financial treasures expended in those two large-scale missions . 
The key question is this : What does all that firepower really yield ? 
Temporary , mucho macho self-satisfaction ? 
A live-action training ground for toys for boys ? 
In the end , what has been forgotten amid all the na ve and , yes , boyish , fascination with state-of-the-art military equipment is that all those conflicts require a political solution . 
And the prospects for that definitely do not get advanced much by rapid , `` decisive '' military action . 
Quite the opposite : The action may come too fast , exceeding ground commanders ' ability to steer the process of political change . 
Remember L. Paul Bremer , that dapper Timberland `` boot guy '' who quickly determined , in his infinite wisdom and really quite idiotically , to dissolve the Baath Party instead of cleansing it and preserving a semblance of a non-Shiite , non-Iranian-steered power structure in Iraq ? 
Those are exactly the kinds of mistakes that are made if things go too well and too swiftly militarily . 
So the bigger question , with the U.S. media rush toward rapid action in Libya , is : Who 's kidding whom ? 
The Europeans are far from perfect and they know it . 
But it is important to recognize that their scarce-resources-induced go-slow approach actually helps settle the political battlefield in Libya . 
Assume the NATO partners and related parties had succeeded wildly and toppled Gadhafi in next to no time . 
The problem has been all along that , when it comes to the opposition , we don t know whom we are dealing with , who had the skills to lead and we are still grappling with these questions . 
So what time has really been lost ? 
The `` delay '' has only prevented us from making yet another rash , L. Paul Bremer-like pact with yet another potential devil . 
As things stand , Libya 's post-Gadhafi regime , in a way , is slowly shaking itself out by virtue of allowing plenty of members of the previous elite to disassociate themselves from the despot . 
As a result , a gradual internal self-cleansing process is taking place , which can only be said to help the transition and lay the groundwork more deliberately for the subsequent transformation , which is going to be difficult enough . 
Even in Poland , perhaps the biggest success story in terms of self-liberation , it took eight long years , from the imposition of martial law under General Wojciech Jaruzelski in December 1981 to October 1989 , when Solidarnosc had finally won the upper hand . 
Given that , how could Libya , fraught with tribal conflicts as it is , realistically expect to have a transition lasting but a few weeks ? 
In closing , it 's worthwhile to reflect on NATO : NATO , or so it seems , increasingly only brings out the worst in the transatlantic partners these days , even when it seems they are finally pulling on the same rope and in the same direction . 
I remember attending a dinner in Washingtonat a very pro-NATO organization and some people around the table , ardent transatlanticists , spewed with disgust over the Europeans ' actions in Libya . 
`` Wimps , `` incompetents , '' `` cowards '' were probably among the nicer words I heard . 
My own view , that the NATO intervention actually gave the previously rather ephemeral `` responsibility to protect '' some real meaning -LRB- and also created a precedent -RRB- , did n't cut it . 
Neither did my point that , in comparison to the eternal hesitation in the 1990s in dealing with the Balkans , this ought to be considered progress . 
If you engage , I was told , bring maximum force . 
Since the Europeans , as a matter of political and public will , as well as of finances , were not only unable to do it now , but really will be unable to do so at any time in the future , why uphold the charade that is NATO ? 
And there you have it : On the rare occasions when one might surmise a happy meeting of the minds between those who are usually keen to pull the trigger and those who are hesitant to do so , it 's still not good enough . 
That is indeed a wide ocean to bridge , one that will perhaps prove unbridgeable .

Remember the stories about how a bunch of kids with guns were running willy-nilly to the front with no order at all ? 
What if they 'd run all the way to Tripoli ? 
In the last few months the rebel government has been able to train and organize , and form a real government . 
In these days of everything instant , we want everything done right now , but there are consequences to that . 
A Somalia in Libya would have been the outcome in Libya if Qaddafi had been toppled right away . 
Now we can have hope that something better will come about . 
Hope that is , far from certainty . 
June 17 , 2011 at 10:34 am | Reply This article presents the most annoying argument trick in the book : the false choice . 
The choice is not between a massive invasion and the current policy . 
NATO is clearly hampered by lack of political will and resources . 
IF the United States were to dedicate more drones and helicopters to the battle , it would not result in a too-hasty collapse of the Qadaffy regime . 
A measured increase in force would have saved lives . 
The current bloody stalement is the worst case scenario . 
June 17 , 2011 at 11:56 am | Reply Well said and that is exactly how I think . 
NATO has decided not to kill Ghaddafi 's soldiers and mercinaries . 
It is like playing tennis with one leg in chains . 
If NATO bothered to use more drones , A-10s and actually attacked Ghaddafi 's thugs instead of empty buildings and car lots in Tripoli , the pro-democracy forces would have overrun Tripoli by now .

They 're not ` allowed ' to put serious numbers of troops on the ground . 
Based on the experiences of Iraq and Afghanistan this is maybe a good thing . 
The good point of the article is how collaspe of power will be handled , will unlike Iraq and Afghanistan a sensible amoutn be spent on genuine good humanitarian stuff , or will it all go to European contractors in an orgy of tax payers Euros\/Pounds . 
Most of American expenditure in Iraq\/Afghanistan has gone to US corperations .

June 19 , 2011 at 9:56 am | A good point in this article is being made with regards to NATO 's fundamental role . . 
True enough , considerations must be given to the aftermath of any intervention , but , nonetheless , this does does not detract any from the justification of the first engagement . 
If allied nations , or those deemed to be under conditions that qualify as unacceptable sufferage , and more to the point if such may lead to regional instability , then NATO is abliged to act . 
That is its post cold war function . 
On the other hand , it can be said , when placed in comparison with Afghanistan and Iraq , in particular , that the outcome of our intervention could lead only to further instability , and at the very least to prolonged and unintended investments of time and resources . 
Iraq has been a money pit for the US , And , perhaps not without irony , leads to beg the question . . 
what then is the developing nature of NATO intervention , today ? 
Or more broad in scope , as the outcomes will lead to correlated results with wholey US endeavors , what direction have coalition forces in that region been taking with regards to regime change ? 
One thing for certain that modern history has taught the would be military savior is ` be careful what you wish for . ' 
Our decision to train and circulate Manuel Noriega is testament enough . 
And in response I believe that foreign policy on these issues has very much reflected this awareness . 
With Iraq , Afghanistan , and now apparently with Lybia the military trend seems to moved more towards the direction of compromise and sustainable enclosure of the emergency ; like a bunch bandaids on a critically ill patient , but with plenty more bandaids to spare . 
And honestly at this point what other resolutions beyond that could there be . 
Our options thus far have been , one , pull out and avoid further interventions in the future ... disasterous for the global community , two , come in full force , which has been politically unstable . . 
-LRB- No one ever being reminded from their own militaries past just what exactly ` full ' commitment means . 
No society does this anymore , just a fiew remaing despots . -RRB- 
And thirdly we have what seems to be the beginings of our final evolution for joint military and ancillary economic and relieg intervention . . 
Seal the dam , try to keep everything contained within as much open for business as possible , and incorporate as much of every faction as possible into this new sort of pseudo reinfrastructuring . 
Seems a terrible direction , but what others are there . 
We are not about to change the way these regimes function , their populations interact , nor the way their government and coalittions from within take shape . . 
nor for that matter over the next century . 
And we are not suppossed to , they are . 
And that might be the toughest realities of all that we and the world now finally have to face : If we are there for any reason above all it is not just for the oil or for the global community . 
It is because the region has shown no attempts at governing itself . 
Deals are made , foreign militaries are kept on retainter to maintain the status quo ; has been so since 1914 . 
And now that is all gone , and we have nothing to replace it with . 
So get used to patch work and a growing stockpile of bandaids , because they are going to be needing more and more of them before anything like a coordinated and developing system can be built . 
June 17 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | Reply do you the world is run in an arbitrary way .

Do n't go making judgments about things you do not understand June 17 , 2011 at 4:47 pm | Reply The onset of the initial assault on Lybia was to establish the ability to command a no fly zone . 
That objective was met . 
The objective to protect civilians from the assaults by the residing military of Lybia has been poorly defined and executed . 
When NATO command can not determine the depth of scope required to effectively execute the mission what is left is a poorly managed force near equivalent to those `` rebels '' fighting for their freedom on the ground . 
June 18 , 2011 at 2:01 pm | Reply canada is very interested in the oil .

2011-06-17,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Fri Jun 17 , 2011 10:58 am EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Abdullah once called himself a rebel . 
But after spending months in a rebel prison as a suspected government loyalist , the doctor says he has lost faith in the revolution against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
Speaking inside a grimy cell in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , the 28-year-old physician said he was captured by advancing rebel forces in the Mediterranean port of Ras Lanuf in March for working at a state-run hospital . 
`` When I was working in the hospital , I was a strong supporter of the revolution . 
But now my beliefs have changed , '' he said as he reclined on an old rug inside his dimly lit cell . 
`` I still believe Gaddafi should leave . 
But I do n't support the revolution any more . 
We are in a state of civil war . 
It 's difficult to solve problems by force . 
Every drop of blood will make it worse . '' 
The military detention facility , its facade peppered with bullet holes , was set up by the rebels early in the conflict to house government troops captured during fighting around Libya . 
Most of the 75 detainees are soldiers and officers but a handful of people , like Abdullah , were civilians . 
Snatched as Gaddafi loyalists in the confusion of the early days of the conflict , they are now stuck in limbo , unable to prove their loyalties and go back to their families . 
Some , like Abdullah , are bitter and disillusioned . 
`` No one has been charged with anything here . 
We have been told that we are here for security reasons , as POWs , '' Abdullah , who asked not to use his surname , said in fluent English . 
`` Once I talked to my family . 
Once , a month ago . 
I spoke to my brother . 
We were instructed not to give any information about how we are being treated . 
I told them I am okay , in a safe place , that 's it , '' he added . 
For their captors , they are the inevitable victims of a messy and protracted war . 
Prison authorities have promised to release everyone -- both civilians and soldiers -- once the war is over and there is a proper mechanism for their departure . 
`` They all come from their tribes . 
When Gaddafi dies or flees , we will have a big tribal meeting and people will come here from their tribes and they will take their people away , '' said Captain Tariq Muftah , 40 , a senior prison warden . 
Before becoming a prison , the facility housed administrative offices under Gaddafi 's rule , rebels said . 
Broken furniture was scattered around its crumbling rooms and corridors when Reuters was allowed to visit it this week . 
Small cells housing up to five men lined the main corridor . 
Detainees sat in their cells on old striped rugs and blankets . 
Surrounded by heaps of clothes and rubbish , they stared blankly at passing visitors through iron bars . 
Some smoked and played cards . 
Flies buzzed around in the thick , stale air . 
Pictures of helicopter gunships were scribbled on the walls . 
People 's faces were gaunt . 
Some refused to speak altogether . 
Gritting his teeth and unable to hold back his tears , one man , his eyes swollen and cheeks drawn , whispered that he used to be a fighter pilot . 
Then he turned away to face the wall . 
Prison wardens accompanying Reuters confirmed people 's stories . 
Reuters was not allowed to take video or still images . 
Sitting on a grubby mattress in the corridor , Abdusalam Osman , 23 , said he was working in a car parts workshop near Ajdabiyah when he was seized by Gaddafi soldiers in March . 
He said he was subsequently released and returned to the rebel-held east , only to be detained this time by rebel forces suspicious of his experience while in government detention . 
`` I am not a soldier . 
I work in a workshop fixing cars . 
So now we are here , '' he said , pointing at three other men sitting nearby who he said were also civilians from his home town . 
`` Revolutionaries caught me . 
They said : We are not sure you are on our side , you are coming from Gaddafi 's side , so you are going to prison . 
I believe in the revolution . 
Every day they tell me : Tomorrow you will be released , '' he added with a shrug . 
Human Rights Watch , whose researchers have visited the facility , said prisoners were generally being treated well . 
`` There have been some problems at the point of capture . 
A few detainees told us they were mistreated or shot after they were caught on the frontlines ... , '' Sidney Kwiram of Human Rights Watch told Reuters . 
`` It is critical that the opposition authorities demonstrate unambiguous leadership on how to treat captured Gaddafi forces and that they continue to underline their message about humane treatment , including to their fighters on the frontlines . '' 
Speaking to Reuters as their captors looked on , most Gaddafi soldiers said they now supported the revolution . 
`` I was told in -LRB- my hometown of -RRB- Sirt as a soldier that Benghazi was full of al Qaeda . 
So I went to fight them , '' said Nasrdin Mohammed , an army sergeant detained on March 15 . 
`` Then I realized I was on the wrong side . 
Now I just want freedom . '' 
Then he added quietly : `` I was promised to be released once Gaddafi 's government collapses but I do n't believe that . 
I do n't believe that . 
I am puzzled . ''

2011-06-18,"Libyan government denies rape allegations By the CNN Wire Staff CNN obtained a copy of a cell phone video that appears to show a woman being sexually abused . 
The rebels in Libya accuse Gadhafi loyalists of raping women They say videos confiscated from soldiers show rapes and torture CNN obtained a cell phone video that appears to show the rape of a woman The Libyan prime minister denies the charges and accuses the rebels of lying Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Libyan government has denied rebel allegations that Moammar Gadhafi loyalists have been raping women , despite videos captured on cell phones that appear to show sexual abuse . 
The Gadhafi regime had initially not responded to CNN requests for comment on the abuse allegations but Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi said Friday at a news conference that women are `` our sisters '' and Libyan soldiers would not commit such heinous acts . 
`` This , like the other mercenaries lies , are false , '' al-Mahmudi said . 
Rebel fighters said they have found videos of rape on cell phones confiscated from captured or killed Libyan soldiers . 
CNN obtained a copy of a cell phone video that appears to show a woman being sexually abused . 
The person who gave the video to CNN said it was on a cell phone that was confiscated from a Gadhafi loyalist . 
`` I ca n't bear it ! 
I ca n't bear it ! '' 
`` Let 's push it farther , '' a male voice says off-camera . 
`` No , no , that 's enough ! '' 
ICC reacts to Libya rape claims Eventually , one of the men puts his sock-covered foot on her face . 
In Arab culture , that is considered a major insult . 
But in this case , it pales in comparison to what the victim is already enduring . 
Arabic speakers who listened to the video at CNN 's request said the voices have Tripoli accents . 
There is no date on the video and the men in it are not wearing military uniforms . 
CNN has been unable to verify the video 's authenticity , when it was shot , or by whom . 
The person who gave it to CNN asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by Libya 's conservative society . 
Al-Mahmudi said there was no proof that Libyan soldiers were behind the abuse . 
It said the perpetrators could belong to the armed gangs leading the rebellion against Gadhafi . 
An opposition spokesman , however , said the video illustrated a pattern of abuse by Libyan soldiers . 
`` We were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war , because it was systematic , '' rebel spokesman Abdullah al-Kabeir said . 
The rebels have many videos showing other types of torture , and a few depict rape , he said . 
He did not know exactly how many videos there were showing abuse . 
One of the most famous faces of Libya 's revolution , Eman al-Obeidy , dramatically claimed in March she had been gang-raped by pro-Gadhafi forces . 
She has since fled the country . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was `` deeply concerned '' over the reports of wide-scale rape in Libya and called for an investigation . 
`` Gadhafi 's security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war , and the United States condemns this in the strongest possible terms , '' she said .

2011-06-18,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Sat Jun 18 , 2011 10:52 am EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's rebel oil chief accused the West on Saturday of failing to keep up its promises to deliver urgent financial aid , saying his authority had now run out of cash completely after months of fighting . 
Libya 's economy relies on oil exports and the rebels have struggled to make ends meet as damage to energy infrastructure caused by the civil war has brought production to a halt in what used to be a major OPEC oil producer in North Africa . 
Western powers are helping the rebels with daily air strikes against forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , and have promised to expand aid backed by Libyan assets frozen abroad . 
Speaking to Reuters in a rare interview in the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi , oil and finance minister Ali Tarhouni said the cash had yet to arrive four months into the war . 
`` We do n't have any -LRB- cash -RRB- . 
We are running out of everything . 
It 's a complete failure . 
Either they -LRB- Western nations -RRB- do n't understand or they do n't care . 
Nothing has materialized yet . 
And I really mean nothing , '' he said . 
`` All of these people we talk to , all of these countries , at all these conferences , with their great grand speeches -- we appreciate -LRB- them -RRB- from the political side , but in terms of finances they are a complete failure . 
Our people are dying . '' 
The economy in east Libya is in tatters . 
The authorities are struggling to find cash to pay for military operations as well as salaries in a society where , thanks to the legacy of Gaddafi 's centralized rule , most people depend on state wages . 
Western states have offered to help . 
The European Union has pledged support and Washington , which took a leading role in securing a U.N.-backed no-fly zone over Libya , has promised more aid and offers of loans to keep the rebels afloat . 
Asked why he thought it was taking Western nations so long to produce money , Tarhouni said : `` No idea . 
... I am tired of asking them . '' 
He had earlier estimated the rebels were spending up to 100 million Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 86 million -RRB- per day . 
`` I do n't expect us to produce oil any time soon . 
The refineries have no crude oil , so they are not working , '' he said . 
`` People died for this revolution and are still dying . 
We will find a way -LRB- to raise money -RRB- . 
One thing is for sure : We will never give up . '' 
Supplies of fuel , vital to keeping eastern towns supplied and maintaining the campaign against Gaddafi , are tight . 
Tarhouni said that refineries , including the one in Misrata , and other crucial installations had been damaged by the fighting , but the pipelines were still intact . 
Libya produced 1.6 million barrels per day before the war and exported about 1.3 million bpd . 
Rebels sold their first tanker full of crude to U.S. refiner Tesoro in April , but production has since ground to a halt due to concerns over the security of the oil fields . 
Rebels now rely on imports of fuel . 
Asked about the mechanism of deliveries , Tarhouni said : `` We have signed -LRB- fuel supply -RRB- contracts and we have companies that were gracious enough to delay those payments for the future . 
`` We get it -LRB- fuel -RRB- basically from these contractors . 
I personally do n't know where they get it from , but I think it 's just from the spot market , most of it . 
The companies are international companies . '' 
He said the rebel authority had put together a budget totaling 3.6 billion Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 2.98 billion -RRB- . 
`` But my immediate needs are much less than that . 
I can deal with whatever that I can have access to , '' he said . 
Tarhouni said the rebel government was holding direct talks with foreign companies on future cooperation , adding that he had no qualms about dealing with those which had earlier worked closely with Gaddafi 's government in the capital Tripoli . 
Asked which companies he was talking to , he named Germany 's Wintershall and France 's Total . 
`` We need help , we said we respect and abide by all contracts . 
The only enemy that I have is Gaddafi and his killers and thugs , '' he said . 
`` In terms of commerce and companies I have no enemies . ''

Full Article Libyan officials say NATO hits civilian house TRIPOLI | Sun Jun 19 , 2011 10:53 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan officials said on Sunday a NATO strike had hit a civilian house in the capital Tripoli , killing several residents , and NATO said it was investigating the claim , which could sow new doubts about its mission . 
On another front in the four-month-old battle to force out Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , a doctor in the city of Misrata said eight rebel fighters had been killed and 36 wounded in fighting with government troops . 
In the early hours of Sunday , reporters were taken by Libyan government officials to a residential area in Tripoli 's Souq al-Juma district where they saw a body being pulled out of the rubble of a destroyed building . 
Later , in a hospital , they were shown the bodies of two children and three adults who , officials said , were among a total of seven people killed in the strike . 
`` There was intentional and deliberate targeting of the civilian houses , '' deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said at the site . 
`` This is another sign of the brutality of the West . '' 
There was no way for reporters to verify that all the bodies they were shown came from the building . 
`` NATO is looking into reports of civilian casualties following NATO air strikes in the early hours of June 19 , '' the alliance said in a statement from Naples , from where it is running the Libyan operation . 
`` The incident is said to have occurred in a residential area in northern Tripoli , following a deliberate strike which targeted a missile site operated by pro-Gaddafi forces . 
`` NATO regrets any loss of civilian lives , and is doing all it can to protect the people of Libya from the violence waged by the Gaddafi regime . 
`` We take all reports of civilian casualties very seriously and we will continue to look into the facts related to this event , '' the alliance said . 
`` NATO would be sorry if the review of this incident did indicate that it was caused by a NATO weapon . '' 
At the scene of the destroyed building on Sunday , clothes , smashed crockery and a child 's rubber duck could be seen littered around the area . 
The building is in a neighborhood where security forces have in the past few weeks put down anti-Gaddafi protests . 
`` Why is NATO doing this to us ? 
asked Ibrahim Ali , who said he lived on the same street as the wrecked building . 
`` NATO is a big problem for the Libyan people . 
NATO does n't have any business here , this is between the Libyan people . '' 
Another man , who gave his name as Tony , nodded towards the remains of the building and said : `` They -LRB- local people -RRB- do n't like this ... But they do n't like the regime either . '' 
On at least one occasion in the past , doubts have emerged about the reliability of Libyan claims of civilian casualties . 
In one case , Libyan officials presented a wounded child to foreign media as the victim of an air strike but medical staff passed a note to a foreign journalist saying she was hurt in a road accident . 
If it is proved that Sunday 's deaths were caused by a NATO air strike , it would be the first acknowledged incident of its kind in the campaign and could weaken the fragile resolve of some countries in the alliance . 
NATO has been pounding targets in Libya for months in what it says is an operation to protect civilians who rebelled against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . 
The Libyan leader says it is an act of colonial aggression designed to steal oil . 
Strains are appearing within NATO member states as the campaign drags on for longer than most of its backers anticipated and Gaddafi remains in power -- even making a show of defiance last week by playing chess with a visiting official . 
Sunday marked three months since NATO warplanes went into action over Libya . 
Rebels from the city of Misrata , about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , have been trying to push west towards the capital but on Sunday they took heavy casualties when they came under fire from pro-Gaddafi forces . 
A doctor at a field hospital near the frontline in Dafniyah , just west of Misrata , said eight fighters had been killed and 36 wounded . 
A Reuters reporter at the field hospital said he saw a procession of pick-up trucks arriving from the front carrying the wounded and the dead , some of them covered with blankets . 
`` Gaddafi 's forces were underground -LRB- in trenches -RRB- . 
We were patrolling and they ambushed us , '' said rebel fighter Mohammed Swelhi , whose friend , Mustafa , was one of two bodies brought from the front in the back of a truck . 
`` My cousin was injured yesterday . 
And today my friend was killed . 
My group , we 're all close friends , '' he said . 
Last week , NATO aircraft dropped leaflets around the frontline warning pro-Gaddafi fighters they would be targeted by attack helicopters if they did not lay down their arms . 
But rebels say there has been little sign of the alliance . 
`` We do n't know what NATO is doing , '' said the doctor , called Nury , who was tending the wounded at the field hospital . 
After four months of civil war , rebels control the eastern third of Libya , the Mediterranean port city of Misrata and much of the Western Mountains stretching to the border with Tunisia . 
But they remain far from seizing Gaddafi 's powerbase of Tripoli and its hinterland despite air support from the world 's most powerful military alliance . 
Speaking in the eastern city of Benghazi , the chief rebel oil official castigated Western powers for failing to make good on their promises to help the rebel cause . 
`` We are running out of everything . 
It 's a complete failure . 
Either they -LRB- Western nations -RRB- do n't understand or they do n't care . 
Nothing has materialised yet . 
And I really mean nothing , '' Ali Tarhouni said in an interview with Reuters . 
`` All of these people we talk to , all of these countries , at all these conferences , with their great grand speeches -- we appreciate -LRB- them -RRB- ... but in terms of finances they are a complete failure . 
Our people are dying , '' he said .

2011-06-20,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : NATO cites a `` weapons system failure '' for causing errant strike NEW : NATO `` regrets the loss of innocent lives , '' official says A Libyan official blames NATO , French , British and U.S. leaders for `` murder and crimes '' Dafniya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO acknowledged Sunday that an errant airstrike in Tripoli may have caused `` a number of civilian casualties . '' 
Libya 's government had claimed earlier Sunday that nine people were killed and six injured when a NATO strike hit a residential neighborhood in the Libyan capital . 
`` This is cold-blooded murder , '' government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said at the scene in Tripoli . 
`` Is this the protection of civilians ? 
Is this really the search for peace and democracy in Libya , to attack peaceful neighborhoods of Tripoli ? '' 
NATO said in a statement Sunday that a military missile site was the strike 's intended target . 
`` However , it appears that one weapon did not strike the intended target and that there may have been a weapons system failure , '' the statement said . 
Charles Bouchard said the organization `` regrets the loss of innocent lives . '' 
Cmdr. Mike Bracken told CNN Sunday that NATO was doing everything it could to avoid civilian casualties , citing a case in which a missile had been diverted after it was fired last week . 
The statement from NATO noted that the air campaign over Libya has involved more than 11,500 sorties , `` and every mission is planned and executed with tremendous care to avoid civilian casualties . 
NATO remains fully committed to this operation . '' 
On Saturday , the alliance denied earlier Libyan claims it was killing civilians . 
`` The claims made by Gadhafi and members of his regime are outrageous . 
It is Gadhafi and his regime that have been systematically and brutally attacking the Libyan people , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu in response to Libyan government accusations . 
Separately , at least eight people were killed and 30 were wounded in fighting in Dafniya , west of Misrata , according to records at Al-Hikma hospital and a field hospital that are treating casualties . 
Most of the dead appear to be rebel fighters . 
A rebel who identified himself only as Walid said he and fellow fighters came under `` intense , intense , intense '' shelling when they tried to advance on Gadhafi forces Sunday . 
They were forced to retreat , allowing Gadhafi forces to advance , he told CNN . 
Bombardments began in the Dafniya area on Sunday morning , and a CNN crew could hear them continue on a fairly regular basis through the day . 
A stream of wounded people flowed into a makeshift hospital in Dafniya , and witnesses reported seeing intense artillery fire coming from both sides of the clashes . 
A local radio station in Misrata was calling for people to donate O-positive blood to meet increased demand after the fighting Sunday . 
Ibrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said the government holds NATO , British Prime Minister David Cameron , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and U.S. President Barack Obama `` responsible morally and legally for this murder and crimes '' for the alleged strike that killed nine in Tripoli on Sunday . 
State TV reported that three of the people killed belonged to the same family . 
The network broadcast footage of a destroyed building and a chaotic scene of rescue teams and civilians pulling a body from the rubble . 
The incident occurred a day after NATO acknowledged that its aircraft had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition in the hotly contested eastern oil city of al-Brega . 
On Saturday , NATO expressed regret over the incident . 
NATO did not provide details as to how many people , if any , died or were injured in the al-Brega strike , which took place on Thursday . 
But in a statement released Saturday , NATO admitted that its forces hit vehicles that were `` part of an opposition patrol '' -- an incident the military alliance described as `` unfortunate . '' 
For weeks , NATO forces have been targeting forces loyal to Gadhafi in an effort to prevent civilian casualties . 
Most of those strikes have come from missiles fired from off-shore ships or aircraft flying high above the north African nation , though earlier this month British and French attack helicopters did fly closer to the ground in al-Brega to go after targets in that city more precisely . 
Al-Brega is on a frontline -- east of Gadhafi 's base in Tripoli and west of the rebels ' headquarters in Benghazi -- in fighting that has taken place between the two sides over the past several months . 
In its statement , NATO said that `` a column of military vehicles , including tanks , '' were spotted Thursday around al-Brega where Gadhafi forces `` had recently been operating . '' 
During what it called `` a particularly complex and fluid battle scenario , '' leaders in the military alliance ordered a strike after determining these vehicles posed `` a threat to civilians . '' 
`` We regret any possible loss of life or injuries caused by this unfortunate incident , '' NATO said in its statement .

2011-06-20,"Supporters of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi demonstrate in Tripoli on Friday . 
CNN 's David McKenzie gets away from Libya government minders to talk to ordinary people `` Ninety percent of the people hate Gadhafi , '' a businessman says Security forces battle protesters right behind journalists ' backs , a cab driver says The government denies there are anti-Gadhafi protests in the capital Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At first glance , `` Mahmoud '' would seem the perfect candidate to be a supporter of Moammar Gadhafi . 
He has prospered during the Libyan leader 's 41-year reign , first as a professional and later taking care of his deceased father 's businesses . 
But , as with many things in Tripoli , a first glance can be deceiving . 
`` Ninety percent of the people in Tripoli hate Gadhafi , '' Mahmoud told me over sips of espresso at a corner coffee shop this weekend . 
`` All his people do is tell lies . 
If anyone tells you different they are just afraid . '' 
CNN is withholding his real name for his own safety . 
On an almost hourly basis , regime officials and government minders tell foreign journalists that Tripoli is a stronghold of Gadhafi and that dissent has vanished in recent months . 
CNN , like other media here , is under severe government restrictions . 
But I recently managed to slip away from government minders to talk directly to several Libyans . 
And according to several eyewitness accounts , major demonstrations were held against Libya 's strongman as recently as last week . 
And in the Souq al-Juma neighborhood of the capital , where anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted in February , the government 's propaganda bubble is quickly burst . 
While international journalists including me were ferried by government minders to a pro-Gadhafi rally at Green Square on Friday afternoon , multiple sources tell CNN that several Tripoli neighborhoods were wracked by running battles between protesters and security forces . 
`` They were protesting right around the corner . 
They streamed out of a mosque and onto the small square , '' said Mahmoud . 
`` Almost immediately Gadhafi forces fired at them with live rounds . '' 
Mahmoud and other sources say that the group was several hundred strong . 
He claims that three people were killed and that the area was put under lockdown by government security . 
Other people in the area confirmed the death toll , but it is impossible for CNN to independently verify this account . 
The government has repeatedly denied any anti-Gadhafi protests in Tripoli in recent weeks , including on Friday . 
A taxi driver in his 20s also said that he took part in one of the protests in Souq al-Juma on Friday . 
CNN is calling him Jamal -- not his real name -- to protect his safety . 
`` We came out after afternoon prayers , '' he said , `` we were unarmed and peaceful and they just shot at us . '' 
He says he a bullet grazed his arm . 
Jamal says that unlike the rebels in the East , they do n't have easy access to weapons to fight . 
But he says , `` I am not afraid . 
Even though we were unarmed , I am doing this for the future of my country . '' 
Another protest was fired upon in a seaside neighborhood of the capital , Jamal says , citing friends who said they were at the demonstration . 
Speaking to journalists in Tripoli is risky . 
Gadhafi 's vast spying network means that almost anyone on the street could be an informer or worse . 
Residents of Souq al-Juma say that hundreds , if not thousands , have been summarily arrested by the dreaded intelligence `` brigades . '' 
They are never heard from again . 
And it seems nowhere is safe . 
Jamal says that recently , a family he knows pinned up a rebel flag out of sight in their home . 
Somehow the intelligence services found out . 
`` They stormed into the house , pulled down the flag , and arrested every man in that house , '' says Jamal . 
But the worst indignity of all , people here say , is they ca n't bury their dead . 
`` The Gadhafi men . 
They come out and shoot you like cats , '' Mahmoud told me . 
`` they hold their guns over you like this and shoot you like cats . 
We are not people to them . '' 
Regime officials will often then take the dead away , he says , not affording people a proper burial . 
`` If we bury them , we must do it in secret . ''

2011-06-20,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : NATO says , `` This was a precision strike on a legitimate military target '' NEW :3 rockets from Gadhafi forces strike near port in rebel-held Misrata The Libyan government alleges 15 people , including three children , died Fighting is ongoing near Dafniya , west of Misrata Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO said Monday that a residential building west of Tripoli was targeted early Monday in an airstrike that the Libyan government alleges killed 15 people , including three children . 
NATO said in a statement that , while it could not confirm the casualties , `` we would regret any loss of civilian life and we go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties . '' 
The organization added that the strike was justified . 
`` This was a precision strike on a legitimate military target -- a command-and-control node which was directly involved in coordinating systematic attacks on the Libyan people , '' NATO said in the statement . 
`` The facility which was struck was identified as a command-and-control node through rigorous analysis based on persistent intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance carried out over a prolonged period of time , '' it said . 
`` This strike will greatly degrade the Gadhafi regime forces ' ability to carry on their barbaric assault against the Libyan people , '' said NATO Lt.-Gen . 
Charles Bouchard , referring to the Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
Monday 's incident occurred about 4 a.m. -LRB- 10 p.m. ET Sunday -RRB- , said Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim , and included strikes from eight rockets . 
Five houses and a farm were hit in the Surman area , he said . 
Surman is west of Tripoli . 
One of the homes belongs to Khaled el-Kweldi , a top aide to Gadhafi , Ibrahim said . 
He was not home at the time of the attack , but Khaleda el-Kweldi , a 6-year-old girl , was killed , along with Khalid el-Kweldi , a 4-year-old boy , the spokesman said . 
Another 6-year-old , Salam Lanouri , was also killed , according to Ibrahim . 
Monday 's strike in Surman came a day after NATO acknowledged an errant airstrike in Tripoli may have caused `` a number of civilian casualties . ''

It is Gadhafi and his regime that have been systematically and brutally attacking the Libyan people , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said in response to Libyan government accusations . 
The European Union 's Foreign Affairs Council , meeting Monday in Luxembourg , stepped up sanctions on Gadhafi 's regime , freezing assets of `` six port authorities under the regime 's control . '' 
`` The EU is taking further action against the military arsenal used by the regime against its own citizens , '' the organization said . 
Humanitarian shipments are exempt from the measure , it added . 
`` Time is not on Gadhafi 's side , '' the organization said . 
`` He has lost all legitimacy to remain in power . 
... The time has come for a new chapter where Libyans can choose their own future . '' 
Late Monday , Gadhafi forces fired three rockets near the port in rebel-held Misrata , said CNN reporters , who saw the strikes from their hotel . 
There were no immediate reports of casualties . 
Fighting was ongoing Monday between rebels and troops in Dafniya , west of Misrata . 
Several rounds of bombardments could be heard by a CNN crew , and three dead rebels were taken to a field hospital near the front lines . 
Hospital staff said 20 wounded rebels were taken to the hospital . 
Earlier Monday , the bodies of three other rebels were taken to a second field hospital . 
At least eight people died and 30 were wounded Sunday in the fighting , according to records at Al-Hikma hospital and a field hospital .

2011-06-20,"EU to look at using frozen Libyan funds for rebels LUXEMBOURG | Mon Jun 20 , 2011 2:05 pm EDT LUXEMBOURG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday to look into using frozen Libyan funds to assist rebels opposing Muammar Gaddafi , with Italy saying funds frozen under sanctions could be used as collateral for loans . 
Rebels have long complained that they are short of cash and have sought access to Libyan money in foreign accounts so they can pay salaries and buy supplies . 
But allowing them direct access to frozen funds could run afoul of U.N. sanctions . 
A statement agreed at a meeting in Luxembourg said the European Union acknowledged the urgent financial needs of the rebel transitional council in Libya . 
`` The mobilization of international resources , including where possible through the use of Libyan frozen funds , in compliance with the provisions of the relevant UNSCRs -LRB- United Nations Security Council Resolutions -RRB- , is key to support the inclusive transition process aimed at fostering national reconciliation , '' the statement said . 
The statement added that `` measures in this regard will respect the rule of law . '' 
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said the EU was looking at using frozen assets as collateral to raise funds for the rebels , as only the U.N. Security Council could decide to unfreeze assets . 
`` We are looking into using frozen assets as guarantees to give loans in advance , '' to the Libyan rebels , '' he told reporters . 
`` We are not looking into unfreezing frozen assets . '' 
Libya 's cash-strapped rebel authority said on Sunday it expected to start replenishing its empty coffers this week with the first batch of money promised by its foreign allies . 
The rebels say they need more than $ 3 billion to cover salaries and other needs in the next six months and have won promises of financial assistance from Western and Arab supporters . 
Libya 's economy relies on oil exports and the rebels have struggled to make ends meet as damage to energy infrastructure caused by the civil war has brought production to a halt in what used to be a major OPEC oil producer in North Africa . 
The European Union has imposed sanctions , including asset freezes , on dozens of Libyan individuals and companies seen as supporters of Gaddafi in an effort to persuade him to give up power . 
They include firms in the oil sector . 
A bill that would allow President Barack Obama to use up to $ 10 billion in frozen Libyan government assets for humanitarian aid to Libyans caught in the civil war has stalled in the Senate . 
The United States is holding more than $ 34 billion as part of sanctions imposed in late February against Gaddafi and his top officials . 
Under the measure , none of the assets could be used to buy weapons or military equipment .

Full Article Libya civilian deaths sap NATO credibility - Italy TRIPOLI | Mon Jun 20 , 2011 8:22 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The NATO military alliance has endangered its credibility with a bomb that destroyed a house in the Libyan capital , killing several residents , Italy 's foreign minister said on Monday . 
It was the first time NATO had acknowledged causing multiple civilian casualties in Libya and came as the alliance feels the strain of a campaign taking more time and resources than expected . 
NATO said the intended target was a missile site . 
The head of its Libya operations said he regretted the loss of life and that a system failure may have knocked the weapon off course . 
Libyan officials accused NATO of deliberately targeting the population and blamed the alliance for further civilian deaths in the southern town of Sebha and in Surman west of Tripoli . 
`` NATO is endangering its credibility ; we can not risk killing civilians , '' Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told reporters before an EU foreign ministers ' meeting in Luxembourg to discuss ways to aid rebels trying to oust Muammar Gaddafi . 
Frattini expressed concern that NATO was losing the propaganda war to Gaddafi and that Western media reports did not emphasise enough the good work done by the alliance every day to protect Libyan civilians . 
`` We can not continue our shortcomings in the way we communicate with the public , which does n't keep up with the daily propaganda of Gaddafi , '' he said . 
NATO was continuing with its three-month campaign of air strikes on Monday . 
A Reuters reporter in central Tripoli said he heard jets overhead around midday , then a distant explosion . 
There were no details immediately available on what the strike had hit . 
Libyan official news agency JANA said air strikes killed four civil defense staff and wounded 10 others on Sunday when they rushed to provide first aid for people at civilian sites hit by the coalition in Sebha . 
Government officials took reporters to Surman , 70km -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , to the site of what they said was a NATO strike targeting the home of Khouildi Hamidi , a member of the 12-member Revolutionary Command Council that Gaddafi set up after seizing control of Libya in 1969 . 
The government said 15 civilians were killed , including three children . 
Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called the attack a `` cowardly terrorist act which can not be justified . '' 
NATO has been pounding targets in Libya since March 19 in what it says is an operation to protect civilians in a rebellion against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . 
The Libyan leader says it is an act of colonial aggression designed to steal Libya 's oil . 
Strains are appearing within NATO member states as the campaign drags on for longer than its backers expected and Gaddafi remains in power -- even making a show of defiance last week by playing chess with a visiting official . 
Reporters taken to the residential area in Tripoli 's Souq al-Juma district by Libyan officials early on Sunday saw several bodies being pulled out of the rubble of a destroyed building . 
Later , in a hospital , they were shown the bodies of two children and three adults who , officials said , were among nine civilians killed in the strike . 
`` NATO regrets the loss of innocent civilian lives and takes great care in conducting strikes against a regime determined to use violence against its own citizens , '' said Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's operations over Libya . 
Libyan Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi said the NATO strike was a `` pathetic attempt ... to break the spirit of the people of Tripoli and allow small numbers of terrorists to cause instability and disorder in the peaceful city '' . 
A spokesman for the rebels fighting to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule said the Libyan leader was to blame . 
`` We are sorry for the loss of civilian life that was caused by air strikes carried out by NATO , '' said Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , vice chairman of the rebel National Transitional Council . 
`` We hold the Gaddafi regime responsible for having placed its military -LRB- installations -RRB- near civilian areas , '' he said . 
`` So these losses are to be expected . '' 
The rebel leadership based in the eastern city of Benghazi was banking on a quick overthrow of Gaddafi but his better-equipped militias have weathered intense NATO bombing to stop the rebels pushing west to Tripoli . 
Rebel diplomatic chief Mahmoud Jibril was due on Tuesday to travel to China , which has not taken a firm side in Libya 's civil war but has tried to expand ties with the opposition . 
The rebel oil and finance minister accused the West on Saturday of failing to keep promises of vital financial aid , leaving the rebels without any money to continue their four-month campaign to unseat Gaddafi . 
`` All of these countries , at all these conferences , with their great grand speeches -- we appreciate -LRB- them -RRB- from the political side , but in terms of finances they are a complete failure . 
Our people are dying , '' Ali Tarhouni told Reuters .

2011-06-20,"SURMAN , Libya | Mon Jun 20 , 2011 7:56 pm EDT SURMAN , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Libyan government said on Monday 19 civilians were killed in a NATO air strike on the home of one of Muammar Gaddafi 's top officials , a day after NATO admitted killing civilians in a separate aerial attack . 
Libyan officials took reporters to Surman , 70 km -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , to the site of what they said was a NATO air strike on the home of Khouildi Hamidi , a member of Libya 's 12-strong Revolutionary Command Council , led by Gaddafi . 
Rescue teams were looking for survivors while reporters visited the site . 
Reporters were then taken to a hospital in nearby Sabrata where they were shown nine bodies , including those of two children , plus some body parts , which the Libyan government said were all of people killed in the attack . 
The state-run Jana news agency later reported on its website that eight children were among 19 people killed in the attack . 
The dead included members of Hamidi 's family , it said . 
The government said Hamidi himself was not hurt . 
NATO said it had bombed a `` legitimate military target -- a command and control node '' in the area , and it could not confirm whether civilians had been hurt . 
It said NATO does not target specific individuals . 
`` This strike will greatly degrade the Gaddafi regime forces ' ability to carry on their barbaric assault against the Libyan people , '' Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , the Canadian commander of NATO 's Libya operation , said in a statement . 
If the Libyan government 's account of civilian deaths is confirmed , the incident could further complicate operations of the NATO-led military alliance , starting to feel the strain of a campaign that is taking longer and costing more than planned . 
NATO acknowledged on Sunday for the first time that it had killed multiple civilians in Libya , when a strike intended to hit a missile site erred and destroyed a house in Tripoli . 
Bouchard said he regretted the loss of life in that incident , and a system failure may have knocked the weapon off course . 
Libyan officials say NATO forces have killed more than 700 civilians , although they have not presented evidence of such large numbers of civilian deaths and NATO denies them . 
Libya says one of Gaddafi 's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed six weeks ago when Gaddafi 's Tripoli compound was hit . 
Italy 's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said on Monday civilian deaths pose a risk to the NATO-led military alliance . 
NATO states have been hitting targets in Libya since March 19 in what they say is an operation to protect civilians . 
`` NATO is endangering its credibility ; we can not risk killing civilians , '' Frattini told reporters before an EU foreign ministers ' meeting in Luxembourg to discuss ways to aid rebels . 
The Arab League , which in March asked the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians , condemned the loss of life in Sunday 's incident . 
`` When the Arab League agreed on the idea of having a no-fly zone over Libya it was to protect civilians but when civilians get killed this has to be condemned with the harshest of statements , '' said Deputy Secretary-General Ahmed Ben Helli . 
The Libyan leader says the Western-led military campaign is an act of colonial aggression designed to steal Libya 's oil . 
Libyan officials accused NATO of deliberately targeting the population . 
Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called Monday 's strike on Hamidi 's house `` a cowardly terrorist act . '' 
Frattini expressed concern that NATO was losing the propaganda war : `` We can not continue our shortcomings in the way we communicate with the public , which does n't keep up with the daily propaganda of Gaddafi . '' 
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States joined NATO in regretting loss of civilian life . 
`` These missions are extremely difficult . 
They are extremely dangerous . 
We faced this situation in Afghanistan , we faced it in the past in Kosovo , '' she said . 
`` It 's always an issue in any NATO mission to maintain popular support , to maintain public understanding for why we are there ... '' Ashour Shamis , a UK-based Libyan opposition activist , said Hamidi played a key role in Gaddafi 's war against the rebels . 
`` He is very much there , controlling the army and supervising military activities , '' he said . 
NATO continued its three-month campaign of air strikes on Monday . 
A Reuters reporter in central Tripoli said he heard jets overhead around midday , then a distant explosion . 
There were no details immediately available on what was hit . 
The rebels have made slow progress since NATO countries joined the fight three months ago , but are now advancing toward Tripoli from a bastion in Misrata east of the capital and from the Western Mountains region to its southwest . 
Shelling attacks by loyalist forces positioned outside Misrata killed 11 civilians in the rebel-held coastal city on Monday , a doctor at the main hospital there said by phone . 
Those included a child who was killed when a salvo of three rockets fired by Gaddafi forces hit a built-up area near the port , a Reuters reporter said . 
Two more children were wounded . 
A rebel at the scene named Hassan Douwa said : `` Is NATO waiting for Gaddafi to kill us all before it does its job ? 
Give us the planes and we will do it ourselves . '' 
Rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan in Misrata said Gaddafi 's forces intensified their shelling of Misrata on Monday , with at least 20 rockets landing in the city center . 
Rebels in the Western Mountains said they had shut off a pipeline that supplies crude from an oilfield in the south to the Zawiyah refinery near the capital Tripoli . 
The refinery is one of the few sources of fuel for Gaddafi-held areas . 
`` This is an attempt by the rebels to stifle the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli , '' rebel spokesman Juma Ibrahim said by phone from the Western Mountains town of Zintan . 
Rebels have been boosted by defections of Gaddafi loyalists . 
They said on Monday 22 soldiers had defected from a unit in the south . 
Gaddafi officials say defections have not made a significant dent in government forces . 
Rebel diplomatic chief Mahmoud Jibril is due on Tuesday to travel to China , which has not taken a firm side in Libya 's civil war but has tried to expand ties with the opposition . 
EU foreign ministers agreed at their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday to look into the possibility of using frozen Libyan funds to assist the rebels . 
The rebel oil and finance minister accused the West on Saturday of failing to keep promises of vital financial aid , leaving the rebels without any money to continue their four-month campaign to unseat Gaddafi . 
In a joint statement they said the European Union acknowledged the urgent financial needs of the rebel transitional council , which requires more than $ 3 billion to cover salaries and other needs in the next six months . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Accidents happen everyday in all areas , but especially , when a CRAZY man tries to hang on to Power for the sake of Power , but hides behind his people using them as human shields . 
`` They -LRB- local people -RRB- do n't like this ... But they do n't like the regime either . '' 
by `` Tony '' was the accurate lead sub-headline . 
What should `` sow ... doubts '' was the length of time it took a -RRB- the World to come to the aid of Ben Ghazi , and b -RRB- NATO to decide helicopter gunships were the only logical defense . 
How many hundreds or thousands of lives were lost by such dawdling ? 
Why ca n't they take out Gaddafi in the same way we took out Osama bin Laden ? 
It seems to me that we need a much larger NATO military force to take care of these so-called world leaders that are nothing more than dictators . 
I would think it would be much cheaper and much more efficient in the long run .

2011-06-21,"By the CNN Wire Staff A Libyan man in Misrata , Libya , in April looks at a government tank destroyed by NATO bombing . 
NEW : The House may consider a resolution limiting U.S. role to noncombat activities Sens. Kerry and McCain introduce a resolution offering support for the Libya mission Critics say the White House has n't complied with the War Powers Resolution Pressure is mounting in the House to cut U.S. support for the NATO-led mission Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two influential U.S. senators introduced a resolution Tuesday expressing support for limited American involvement in the NATO-led military campaign in Libya -- part of an effort to counter rising pressure in the House of Representatives to withdraw backing for the mission . 
Meanwhile , House Speaker John Boehner proposed two resolutions on the Libya mission that could come up for votes on Thursday . 
One would be the same as the Senate resolution introduced Tuesday , and the other would limit U.S. involvement in the mission to a noncombat role while allowing many of the same functions being performed now by U.S. forces to continue . 
The House proposal seeking a noncombat role reflects frustration in Congress over what Boehner and others call President Barack Obama 's failure to get necessary congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution for engaging U.S. forces in the Libya military campaign . 
`` If the Commander-in-Chief believes that intervention in Libya is important for our national security , he has a responsibility to make a case for it -- clearly and publicly -- and seek authorization , '' Boehner said in a statement announcing the two proposed House resolutions . 
`` In the three months since military action in Libya began , none of this has occurred . 
The American people deserve to have their voice heard in this debate , and Congress has a responsibility to hold the White House accountable . '' 
The Senate resolution , introduced by Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry and Arizona Republican John McCain , authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops . 
CNN tours NATO airstrike site `` I believe the president did the right thing by intervening to stop a looming humanitarian disaster , '' McCain said . 
`` I believe we will find a strong , bipartisan majority that is in favor of authorizing our current military operations in Libya and seeing this mission through to success . '' 
Kerry added , `` By supporting this resolution , we tell Arabs young and old that the United States is willing to make tough decisions and spend our tax dollars to help ensure your freedom . '' 
The allied military effort , which already has formal U.N. support , was launched to protect Libyan civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by the North African country 's longtime ruler , Moammar Gadhafi . 
Western leaders have made clear , however , that they believe the mission can not be successfully completed without Gadhafi 's ouster . 
The Obama administration has already promised not to use U.S. ground troops , but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has been mounting . 
An unusual coalition has formed between traditionally anti-war Democrats and conservative Republicans worried about the cost of the conflict and skeptical of its national security importance . 
One of the House resolutions under consideration will be the same as the McCain-Kerry proposal that supports the current limited U.S. role in the mission , Boehner , R-Ohio , said in a statement . 
A House GOP leadership source said the measure is expected to be defeated . 
The second House resolution would remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Libya , except for those engaged in nonhostile actions including search and rescue ; aerial refueling ; operational planning ; intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ; and noncombat missions . 
While the resolution would be nonbinding , its approval by the House would signal strong opposition to Obama 's decision to commit U.S. forces without seeking authorization from Congress . 
A House leadership aide said the second resolution is aimed at U.S. military drones and any other combat role by U.S. forces in Libya , and is likely to pass in the Republican-controlled chamber . 
House Republicans will meet Wednesday to further discuss the issue , and GOP leaders were not ruling out possible changes or additions to the resolutions . 
Critics contend the 1973 War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war , followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities . 
The combined 90-day period ended Sunday . 
Support for the war has also been shaken by evidence presented by Gadhafi 's government of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes . 
NATO officials admitted over the weekend that aircraft from countries in the alliance had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition . 
The White House argues the president did n't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and have n't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities . 
Obama , however , personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , according to a Saturday report in The New York Times . 
In the Senate , Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , have resisted holding a vote on the war because of divisions within their respective caucuses . 
Reid said Tuesday that there is bipartisan support for the McCain-Kerry resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , but that he was still in discussion with the two sponsors on when to bring the measure from the panel to the Senate floor . 
He indicated it could be brought to the floor as early as this week . 
McConnell , meanwhile , told reporters that `` we all anticipate that there will be some kind of Libya debate in the Senate in the near future . '' 
McCain has expressed anger that the White House did n't push for an earlier congressional vote on the war . 
The senator , who ran against Obama in 2008 , contends a resolution of support would have passed easily when NATO first intervened . 
`` The administration 's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive , '' McCain said Tuesday . 
`` The unfortunate result of this failure of leadership is plain to see in the full-scale revolt ... that is occurring in the House of Representatives . '' 
The House is also planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill later this week , and liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , intends to propose an amendment cutting off funding for the mission . 
However , that amendment is likely to only come up next month after the House returns from its Fourth of July recess . 
To prevent a similar resolution from Kucinich from passing earlier , Boehner pushed through a resolution giving the president two weeks to send Congress information justifying the U.S. strategy in Libya . 
Obama responded with a 32-page report arguing in part that he has not violated the War Powers Resolution . 
Even if the Republican-controlled House passes measures intended to limit funding for the Libya mission , it is unlikely the Senate would do the same . 
`` The president 's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya , but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring Gadhafi down , '' conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' on Sunday . 
Obama `` needs to step up his game with Libya , but Congress should sort of shut up and not empower Gadhafi , '' Graham argued . 
In March , the Senate unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting the no-fly zone over Libya . 
Some Republicans , however , have now expressed opposition to that effort , citing growing concerns about its cost . 
In its report on the mission , the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $ 800 million . 
It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $ 1.1 billion . 
Questions about the war 's financial and other costs have also been raised in the United Kingdom , which has played a leading role in the NATO effort . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron insists that Britain 's military involvement in the North African country can continue `` as long as we need . ''

2011-06-21,"By the CNN Wire Staff NATO drone crashes in Libya NEW : 5 rebels killed along frontline in Dafniya , hospital officials say Human Rights Watch reports landmines in the Nafusa Mountains The drone that went down was a U.S. Fire Scout , NATO spokesman says U.S. senators introduce a resolution for limited U.S. involvement Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO said Tuesday that it lost contact with a U.S. unmanned helicopter flying surveillance for the organization over the central coastal area of Libya . 
Contact with the Fire Scout was lost at 7:20 a.m. , said Wing Cmdr. Mike Bracken , a NATO spokesman . 
A Pentagon source told CNN that the Fire Scout belonged to the U.S. Navy . 
Libyan state television reported that an `` Apache helicopter was downed in the area of Majr in Zliten , '' claiming it was the fifth NATO aircraft to be downed . 
An Apache is a manned attack helicopter . 
Bracken denied that NATO had lost any attack helicopters during the alliance 's mission in Libya . 
Gallery : Rockets bring misery to Misrata The resolution , introduced by John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and John McCain , R-Arizona , authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops . 
Libya state TV on Tuesday reported a NATO strike southwest of Tripoli in Nalut city , resulting in `` material and human damages . '' 
Libyan forces were also continuing their attacks . 
At 6 p.m. in Misrata , a CNN employee saw three Grad-type rockets strike the center of the city , slightly wounding a 13-year-old boy in front of a bicycle shop . 
In Dafniya , between Tripoli and Misrata , five rebels were killed and 31 were wounded in clashes along the frontline , according to officials at Misrata 's Al-Hikma Hospital . 
The Libyan war erupted from anti-government protests in February . 
Following a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , NATO began bombing military targets in March . 
However , strongman Moammar Gadhafi still maintains control in Tripoli . 
Tuesday , Human Rights Watch said that Libyan government forces had planted more than 150 landmines in at least one location in the Nafusa Mountains in western Libya . 
The global monitoring group visited the site , inspected mines that had been removed , and interviewed the rebel fighters who removed them . 
`` These antipersonnel landmines pose a huge threat to civilians , '' said Steve Goose , arms director at Human Rights Watch . 
`` More than 150 countries have banned landmines , but Libya continues to defy this global trend . '' 
The human rights group said it has confirmed Gadhafi 's use of five types of landmines in six locations in Libya . 
NATO officials stressed that it was Gadhafi who was deliberately and indiscriminately targeting his own people as the alliance faced questions over a series of incidents over the weekend and into Monday that resulted in allegations of civilian casualties and strikes on Libyan opposition vehicles . 
`` Let 's not lose sight that it is the Gadhafi regime which started this crisis , '' Bracken said . 
Libya said that 15 people , including three children , were killed in Monday 's incident . 
Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said the attack included strikes from eight rockets . 
`` You are planting the seeds of hatred , NATO , '' Ibrahim said . 
Five houses and a farm were hit Sunday in the Surman area , west of Tripoli , he said . 
One of the homes belongs to Khaled el-Kweldi , a top aide to Gadhafi , Ibrahim said . 
The Libyan leader was not home at the time of the attack , but three children were killed , Ibrahim said . 
NATO said a residential building west of Tripoli was targeted early Monday . 
`` NATO is aware of allegations that this strike caused civilian casualties , '' Bracken said . 
`` That is something we can not independently verify , but I say again that this was a legitimate military target . '' 
He would not detail how NATO came to determine that the target was a command-and-control communications node except to say that 17 satellite dishes could be seen in aerial imagery . 
Bracken said the center was involved in coordinating attacks on the Libyan people . 
Monday 's strike in Surman came a day after NATO acknowledged an errant airstrike in Tripoli may have caused `` a number of civilian casualties . '' 
Libya 's government said Sunday that nine people were killed and six wounded when a NATO strike hit a residential neighborhood in the Libyan capital . 
NATO said Sunday that a military missile site was the intended target . 
`` However , it appears that one weapon did not strike the intended target and that there may have been a weapons system failure , '' a NATO statement said . 
On Saturday , NATO expressed regret after its aircraft mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition in the key and hotly contested eastern oil city of al-Brega . 
Meanwhile , Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jibril arrived Tuesday in Beijing for meetings with Chinese officials , state media reported . 
Jibril , chairman of the executive board of the opposition Transitional National Council , will be in China for two days , according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei . 
`` China 's major task is to promote peace and encourage talks , '' Hong said . 
`` China has followed closely the development of the situation in Libya , and calls for the political resolution of the Libyan crisis . '' 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the rebels `` an important political power of Libya . '' 
That recognition comes a month after Jibril said that China bolstered the opposition movement 's stature by purchasing a shipment of oil from the opposition group for $ 160 million . 
`` We have maintained contacts with both sides of Libya , and urge them to take actions that are conducive to the interest of the people of the country , '' Hong said . 
`` We believe that the future of Libya should be determined by the Libyan people themselves , and China will respect the independent choice of the Libyan people . '' 
In May , Jibril met in Paris with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister Francois Fillon . 
France has been a strong backer of the Libyan rebels and the NATO air campaign . 
Also in May , Jibril tried to secure formal recognition for the interim council from the White House , but failed . 
Since then , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the United States views the group as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . 
For weeks , NATO forces have been targeting forces loyal to Gadhafi in an effort to prevent them from inflicting civilian casualties . 
Most of those strikes have come from missiles fired from ships located offshore or from aircraft flying above the North African nation . 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman , Elizabeth Joseph , Jack Maddox , Per Nyberg and Helena Hong contributed to this report .

2011-06-23,"\* Gas oversupply to end as early as 2012 \* Middle east political unrest to cut supplies \* Post-quake Japan demand to soak up more excess supplies PERTH , June 23 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Surplus global gas supplies could disappear as early as winter 2012 as a combination of factors including supply cuts due to Middle East turmoil and increasing demand from quake-hit Japan . 
`` The global oversupply of gas , which was previously forecast to end in 2015 , will now likely end in 2013 and possibly as early as 2012 . 
This oversupply is most manifest in Europe , which has become the market of last resort for LNG supply , '' Noel Tomnay , Wood Mackenzie 's head of global gas , said . 
Japan , the world 's largest importer of liquefied natural gas -LRB- LNG -RRB- , has seen the demand for the fuel jump after the earthquake earlier this year crippled several of its nuclear reactors and forced some of its coal-fired plants to shut . 
The increases in Japanese demand have reduced LNG supply to Europe by over 12 billion cubic meters -LRB- bcm -RRB- or 8.8 million tonnes of LNG in 2011 , according to Wood Mackenzie . 
Japan 's demand for the super-cooled fuel is expected to continue growing . 
Analysts expect demand up by about 8 to 10 million tonnes this year from 70 million tonnes in 2010 . 
The nuclear crisis in Japan also spurred worries about the safety of nuclear technology with Germany deciding to shut all its nuclear plants by 2022 as a result and other nations calling for safety tests of their own nuclear systems . 
As the gas glut ebbs , spot prices may climb higher than contract prices , Wood Mackenzie said . 
Contract prices are currently typically higher than spot prices due to the supply security they provide . 
Supplies are also likely to dwindle as political upheaval continues in Middle Eastern countries such as Libya . 
`` Political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa - notably the Libyan civil war and the corresponding Greenstream pipe capacity outage -- has removed 8 bcm of contracted gas , '' Tomnay said . 
Japanese demand and Middle Eastern production cuts have eroded Europe 's gas supply cushion to less than 10 bcm , the equivalent of 7.3 million tonnes of LNG , in 2011 . 
Unplanned outages like those that have occurred in Nigeria and Algeria during the last two years may add to supply tightness . 
`` The potential for future unplanned LNG outages to disrupt the smooth running of global LNG capacity can not be ruled out , whether they are technical challenges or the result of recent unrest , as that presently seen in Yemen , '' Tomnay said . 
`` Should such outages coincide with a cold winter , such an event combined with ongoing Libyan gas supply disruption could remove Europe 's gas cushion entirely by as early as winter of 2012 . ''

2011-06-24,"As anyone who reads my blog probably knows , I have been a critic of the U.S. military involvement in Libya from the beginning -LRB- see some of my writings on the topic here , here , here , here , here , and here ; and podcasts here , here , and here -RRB- . 
As I ve watched the Libyan adventure unfold , I ve been particularly interested by the myriad justifications that proponents have offered for intervention . 
The predominant reason given and indeed authorized in UN Security Council Resolution 1973 has been to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack . 
Beyond this narrow mandate , however , an additional set of overlapping reasons have been put forth , before and since the intervention began on March 19 . 
Below are but five of the more prominent secondary justifications put forth by Obama administration officials , congressional members , pundits , and policy analysts . 
On the second day of the bombing campaign , cruise missiles were launched into Moammar Gadhafi 's Bab al-Azizia compound in Tripoli . 
The stated military objective was to disrupt the command and control of loyalist forces , but the immediate intention was to kill Gadhafi in an attempt to quickly resolve the civil war . 
The day prior , British defense minister Liam Fox was asked if Gadhafi was a legitimate target , and responded that attacking the Libyan leader would potentially be a possibility . 
Since then , while NATO officials emphasize that it does not intentionally target specific individuals , the alliance has routinely bombed Gadhafi 's suspected residences , including one attack that reportedly killed the Libyan leader s son and three of his grandchildren . 
Since then , the calls for regime change through a targeted killing have only increased . 
Five weeks into the NATO-led bombing campaign , Senator Lindsey Graham demanded that the alliance cut the head of the snake off , go to Tripoli , start bombing -LRB- Gadhafi 's -RRB- inner circle . 
Senator John McCain further lamented that while President Obama was limiting America s military mission to achieve primarily humanitarian objectives , the fact is that we need to take -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- out . 
Foggy Bottom , apparently , wants Gadhafi deposed but only of his own volition . 
Last week , when presented with several potential diplomatic solutions to resolving the civil war , a State Department spokesperson responded that the only option that the United States was willing to entertain was Gadhafi stepping down from power . 
Thus , beyond the initial stated military mission of protecting civilians , the only acceptable outcome of the intervention has become the removal of Gadhafi from power , with the bombing campaign continuing until whenever that objective is achieved . 
Sending a Message to Other Dictators The Libyan uprising and subsequent civil war occurred within the broader context of the Arab Spring that began in neighboring Tunisia , and has swept across North Africa into the Middle East . 
It was believed by many that the demonstration effect of intervening to attempt to stop the brutal repression used by the Gadhafi regime would deter other dictators from doing likewise . 
As the events in Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and even Libya have demonstrated , attempting to use force for second-order psychological effects is a fool s errand , and should not be included as a justification for military intervention in the first place . 
Nevertheless , in the absence of intervention in Libya s civil war , President Obama warned in his March 28 address to the nation that the democratic impulses would be eclipsed by the darkest form of dictatorship , as repressive leaders concluded that violence is the best strategy to cling to power ; former State Department official , Anne Marie Slaughter , contended that if Colonel Gadhafi wins , regimes across the region will conclude that force is the way to answer protests ; Nicholas Kristof , New York Times columnist , claimed that If not for this intervention the message would have gone out to all dictators that ruthlessness works ; former British Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote , We would send a signal of Western impotence in a region that analyzes such signals keenly ; and Senator John Kerry believed that a military intervention in Libya sends a critical signal to other leaders in the region : They can not automatically assume they can resort to large-scale violence to put down legitimate demands for reform without consequences . 
Supporting the Libyan Rebels While the Libyan rebels have been unable to remove Gadhafi from power , its self-appointed leadership group the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- has succeeded at courting western support since its founding on March 5 . 
Utilizing the skills of multi-national public relations firms like the Harbour Group and Bell Pottinger , the TNC has consistently portrayed itself as inclusive , western-educated , committed to democratic principles , and opposed to any Islamist influences . 
The TNC s official website motto : Freedom . 
Democracy provides upbeat messages about the progress of the war , and extensive coverage of every foreign official who tours Benghazi . 
After one such visit in mid-May , Senator John McCain vouched for the rebel leadership , stating : Their Prime Minister got a doctorate at the University of Pittsburgh . 
Their Finance Minister was recently teaching economics in Seattle others are lawyers , doctors , women activists . 
Similarly , after British Foreign Secretary William Hague held talks with the TNC in the rebel-held capital in early June , he declared : These people at the top of this organization are genuine believers in democracy and the rule of law . 
It is quite inspiring . 
After another early June visit to Benghazi , Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman wrote of being profoundly impressed by everyone he encountered , and drew a vivid picture for how the military intervention in Libya was transforming America s image in the Arab world : Imagine walking in the main square of a teeming Arab city and having people wave the American flag , clamor for photographs with a visiting American official , and celebrate the United States as both savior and model . 
Repaying European Support in Afghanistan Reports of the White House debate over whether to join the Paris and London-led war party show that the Obama administration has been a reluctant participant from the start . 
One reason that the administration overcame its reluctance was to maintain the limited support that European NATO allies have provided to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan . 
To repay them for their cooperation in the Hindu-Kush , the United States was compelled to support those European allies in North Africa . 
In explaining why the United States was intervening in a country that was not a vital interest , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted in late March : We asked our allies , our NATO allies , to go into Afghanistan with us ten years ago . 
They have been there and a lot of them have been there despite the fact they were not attacked They stuck with us . 
When it comes to Libya , we started hearing from the U.K. , France , Italy , other of our NATO allies . 
This was in their vital national interests . 
This rationale has endured , with Secretary Gates acknowledging last week : What was going on in Libya was considered a vital interest by some of our closest allies . 
Those are the same allies that have come to our support and assistance in Afghanistan . 
And so it seems to me the kind of limited measured role that the president decided on in support of our allies , who did consider it a vital interest , is a legitimate way to look at this problem . 
Or , as Senators Joe Lieberman and Marco Rubio wrote yesterday : American disengagement would also inflict irreparable damage on the NATO alliance Having walked out on our European allies in the middle of a battle , we can expect them to do the same to us in Afghanistan . 
It Will Be a Piece of Cake A final proposition put forward by intervention proponents was that , ultimately , it would not be very hard to achieve the desired end state . 
Whether based on recent technological advances or the fragile nature of loyalist security forces , such best-case scenario thinking was evident on both sides of the Atlantic . 
Libya s rebels encouraged the Western assumption that Gadhafi could be deposed with ease . 
One purported spokesperson for the rebels Transitional National Council claimed on March 13 , We are capable of controlling all of Libya , but only after the no-fly zone is imposed . 
The United States , according to Obama , would lead with days , not weeks of military action , thus shaping the conditions for the international community to act together . 
White House spokesperson , Jay Carney , later clarified America s role to be a time-limited , scope-limited military action , in concert with our international partners . 
My Council on Foreign Relations colleague Elliot Abrams asserted that only a small amount of effort -LRB- is -RRB- needed from the United States to ensure that Gadhafi is defeated . 
The former U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Merrill McPeak , discussing the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya , contended that it would change their calculation of who might come out on top . 
Just the mere announcement of this might have an impact . 
Meanwhile , the French philosopher Bernard Henri Levy , who was instrumental in flying Libyan rebel leaders to Paris to meet with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , made the implausible claim that If the decision had been made to intervene five or six days earlier , bombing three airports would have been sufficient . 
So Why Does This Matter ? 
Every time the United States considers the use of military force , proponents and opponents offer a smattering of justifications for why it should or should not happen . 
Of course , people have varying vantage points and biases , which leads different arguments to be convincing to different audiences . 
This is to be expected in a democracy . 
But presidents do not have the luxury of finding a lot of arguments convincing enough . 
When presidents authorize a military action , they must have a clear objective in mind . 
Without a singular , defined goal , policymakers can not appropriately match means and ends , which increases the likelihood of failure . 
The United States will assuredly use military force against another state in the future , whether to attempt to protect civilian populations , destroy threatening WMD or ballistic missile capabilities , or degrade assets associated with an adversarial regime . 
When the debates over such interventions unfurl , take the time to sift and winnow through each of the justifications provided by government officials and pundits . 
Then decide for yourself if these arguments either individually , or in some cluster rise to the level of requiring the use of the American military . 
In the case of Libya , there was one overarching rationale provided the protection of civilians yet the initial intervention and the now ninety-seven day bombing campaign has been about so much more . 
I 'm sick and tired of ppl acting like it s ok for us to sit on the sidelines when innocent ppl are being tortured and rapped . 
Has anyone seen the video of the women being sodomized by a broom stick ?!?!?!?!?! Plus it helps that Libya sits on a lake of oil -LRB- uuughh duh we really need it -RRB- . 
These are the same ppl that thought we could negotiate with Hitler . 
And a Hitler and Ghadafi comparison is accurate and not over reaching here , unlike the GW and Obama comparisons . 
Anytime ppl ask for freedom and are lucky to get shot instead of raped and tortured , and the country has a financial means to lift itself from oppression of course we should step in !!!!! Unless its China and or a formable opponent\/ally . 
June 24 , 2011 at 12:44 pm | Reply Anyone else notice the writer does n't really deal with issue # 3 ? 
There 's no explanation in this article about why helping the rebels is `` insufficient '' justification . 
The article merely mentions that the rebels have worked with PR firms . 
Guess what , so does the U.S. Government . 
So does every state government and probably all but our smallest municipalities . 
Since `` helping the rebels '' is just another way of describing NATO 's stated goal -LRB- protecting Libyans from a hostile Gadaffi regime that Libyans by and large have soundly rejected -RRB- , it 's hard to figure why this article was even published , since it does n't address this very central point .

June 24 , 2011 at 4:36 pm | Reply June 24 , 2011 at 7:42 pm | Reply The rebels have been well received lately by the international community . 
Yet a week ago they complained that they still have n't seen the funds that had been promised by donors and should have been deposited last week . 
Meanwhile , rebel leaders said their administration had run out of money as donors ' pledges had not been materialised . 
It will be interesting to see whether the youngster will accept the former enemies , those defected brothers in arms in the new regime .

2011-06-24,"House rejects bill that would have cut funding for U.S. offensive operations in Libya The House also has rejected a measure expressing support for the Libya mission House members say the administration has violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution Administration : Resolution not violated because the U.S. is n't technically engaged in hostilities Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Republican-controlled House of Representatives delivered a mixed message on America 's role in the NATO-led Libya campaign Friday , opposing a resolution expressing support for the war while also voting down a bill restricting American involvement in the conflict . 
The first measure -- similar to legislation introduced in the Senate by Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona -- was backed by the White House . 
It was defeated 123-295 , with Republicans overwhelmingly opposing the measure and Democrats voting more narrowly in favor of it . 
The second measure was strongly supported by House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , and other top GOP leaders . 
It was defeated 180-238 , with Democrats largely voting no as Republicans voted yes by a slimmer margin . 
In short , the House appeared unable to speak with clarity on President Barack Obama 's controversial effort to oust Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
White House press secretary Jay Carney expressed disappointment in the first House vote , and told reporters the `` writing is on the wall '' for Gadhafi . 
`` Now is not the time to let up , '' he said . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was `` gratified that the House has decisively rejected efforts to limit funding for the NATO mission . '' 
Debate on U.S. involvement in Libya White House defends actions in Libya Protesting for , against Gadhafi in Libya Rape as a weapon of war `` I am pleased that a very important statement was made today by the House , on a bipartisan basis , that recognizes the need for us to continue this important mission , '' she added . 
Asked to explain the relatively rare defeat for the House leadership on the second vote , Boehner only offered a one-word reply : `` nothing . '' 
A GOP leadership aide , however , told CNN there was last-minute concern among some Republican members that a vote to restrict certain forms of U.S. involvement in the NATO mission could have been interpreted as an inherent authorization of other types of force . 
`` Once you de-facto -LRB- approve -RRB- it ... then the president can run with it , '' said Rep. Scott Garrett , R-New Jersey , who opposed both measures . 
`` What we 're trying to do here is have our cake and eat it too . 
We 're trying to split it in half by declaring a partial war and then telling -LRB- Obama -RRB- how he is going to be commander-in-chief . '' 
`` I do n't think you can do that in a bill , '' Garrett said . 
`` The proper resolution would say we should not be over there , -LRB- and -RRB- we are withholding all funds for all military activity , period . '' 
Rep. Gerry Connolly , D-Virginia , who backed the support resolution while opposing the bill restricting involvement , said he was n't lobbied by the White House until Friday morning . 
`` I think moving forward , a lesson -LRB- about administration outreach -RRB- has been learned here , '' he said . 
Much of the House 's disapproval of the Libya campaign has been fueled by a belief that Obama failed to sufficiently consult with Congress before committing to military engagement . 
Specifically , representatives from both political parties say the administration has violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution , which gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war , followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities . 
The combined 90-day period ended last Sunday . 
Support for the war has also been further shaken by evidence of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes . 
The White House says Obama did n't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and have n't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities . 
The president , however , personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , according to a report published Saturday in The New York Times . 
Boehner said during Friday 's debate on the House floor that Obama 's authority under the Constitution `` does not free the president from accountability to the American people , this Congress or the rule of law . '' 
The War Powers Resolution `` is the law of the land and simply can not be ignored , '' he said . 
The GOP-sponsored bill is necessary to `` defend the constitutional authority of the legislature '' and provides `` much-needed accountability . '' 
Some Democrats , however , blasted Republicans , accusing them of playing politics with what they called a critical foreign policy priority . 
`` This was not handled right '' by the White House , said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D-Texas . 
But the House votes are `` nothing but politics , '' and `` I do n't want to abandon my friends in the Arab states who are now struggling for democracy . '' 
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday it would be a mistake for Congress to cut funding for U.S. military operations in Libya . 
`` I think , once we have our forces engaged , to deny them funding would be a mistake , '' Gates told PBS News . 
Key American allies -- especially the British , the French and the Italians -- consider Libya a vital interest , and `` our alliance with them is a vital interest for us , '' he said , citing their efforts in Afghanistan . 
Gates insisted that progress has been made toward the U.S. goal of ousting Gadhafi . 
`` Based on everything we see , the government gets shakier by the day , '' Gates said . 
`` His forces have been significantly diminished . 
The opposition is expanding the areas under their control . '' 
Clinton met privately with House Democrats on Thursday to urge support for the resolution backing the Libya mission , according to a Democratic source who attended the meeting . 
`` The bottom line is , whose side are you on ? '' 
she said earlier in the week . 
`` Are you on Gadhafi 's side , or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them ? '' 
The allied military effort , which has formal United Nations support , was launched to protect Libyan civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by Gadhafi . 
Western leaders have made clear , however , that they believe the mission can not be successfully completed without Gadhafi 's ouster . 
The White House has promised not to use U.S. ground troops , but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has nevertheless been mounting over several weeks . 
In addition to concerns about the War Powers Resolution , traditional anti-war Democrats and fiscally conservative Republicans are worried about the cost of the conflict . 
In a recent report on the mission , the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $ 800 million . 
It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $ 1.1 billion . 
CNN 's Dana Bash , Rachel Streitfeld and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

2011-06-24,"By the CNN Wire Staff Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the NATO mission in Libya should not be abandoned , speaking during a trip to Jamaica . 
`` To deny them funding would be a mistake , '' Gates says `` The government gets shakier by the day , '' he say `` The president has failed to make his case , '' Boehner says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Outgoing Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday it would be a mistake for Congress to cut funding for U.S. military operations in Libya .

But , he acknowledged , `` I do n't think anybody can predict when he will and\/or leave . '' 
But the bottom line is , whose side are you on ? 
Are you on Gadhafi 's side or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them ? 
-- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . 
Protesting for , against Gadhafi in Libya Gates was appointed to the job 4-1\/2 years ago by President George W. Bush , and continued to serve in the role under President Barack Obama . 
He is slated to retire June 30 . 
But Congress has expressed impatience with the pace of the NATO military effort , which got under way three months ago to protect peaceful anti-government demonstrators in Libya . 
Republicans have accused Obama of having violated the War Powers Act by not having sought congressional authorization for the military intervention within 60 days -- a deadline that has passed . 
Obama said last week that he did not believe he needed the approval because the U.S. military role is limited . 
But that did n't placate some House Republicans . 
`` I believe -- and I think most of my colleagues believe -- that the president has failed to make his case as to why we have engaged in Libya , '' House Speaker John Boehner told reporters Thursday . 
`` I think the strategy was flawed from the beginning . 
As I said then , I understand the humanitarian mission , but the idea that the rest of the strategy was to hope that Gadhafi would leave begged the question of well how long are we going to be there ? '' 
But , the Ohio Republican added , `` I do n't want to do anything that would undermine NATO or to send the signal to our allies around the world that we are not going to be engaged . 
This is primarily a fight between the Congress and the president over his unwillingness to consult with us before making this decision . '' 
During a trip to Jamaica on Wednesday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton dismissed fears of a quagmire and said the mission should not be abandoned now . 
Clinton said the Libyan opposition has made `` very clear progress '' in its political organization , as well as in its fight against forces loyal to Gadhafi . 
`` But the bottom line is , whose side are you on ? '' 
she said to reporters . 
`` Are you on Gadhafi 's side or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them ? '' 
`` For the Obama administration , the answer to that question is very easy . '' 
Boehner said Wednesday that the GOP-controlled House will not back a resolution sponsored by Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , expressing congressional support for limited American involvement in the NATO-led military campaign in Libya . 
McCain 's resolution , introduced Tuesday with Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for a year , while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops . 
McCain , the GOP 's 2008 presidential nominee and a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War , said he believes Obama `` did the right thing by intervening -LRB- in Libya -RRB- to stop a looming humanitarian disaster . '' 
House leaders are preparing to hold a vote on the McCain-Kerry measure , but are also considering another resolution that would strictly limit U.S. involvement in Libya to a noncombat role . 
Clinton testified Thursday on the matter in private session before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .

2011-06-24,"WASHINGTON | Fri Jun 24 , 2011 7:39 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A move to curb President Barack Obama 's military intervention in Libya was defeated in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday , despite having the support of leaders of the majority Republicans . 
But Obama was delivered a symbolic rebuke hours earlier when lawmakers refused another measure to formally authorize U.S. participation in the NATO-led Libya mission . 
The twin votes starkly highlighted the ambivalence on Capitol Hill over U.S. involvement in Libya 's civil war . 
Some lawmakers argue that Obama violated the 1973 War Powers Act by failing to secure Congressional authorization after 60 days of hostilities , an argument the White House rejects . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the administration was gratified the House had `` decisively rejected '' efforts to restrict funding for U.S. involvement in the operation , adding that it was important to keep up the pressure on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
The measure would have allowed U.S. forces to continue providing reconnaissance , refueling , planning and other services to the NATO-led mission in the North African nation but would have barred them from carrying out both manned and drone air strikes against Gaddafi 's forces . 
Since NATO took over the Libya operation on March 31 , the United States has conducted 755 strike sorties , including 119 in which the planes actually fired at targets . 
Thirty-nine of the strikes involved the use of drone aircraft . 
The White House , however , expressed disappointment over the failure of the separate Democratic-backed measure that would have authorized the United States to continue its limited involvement in the Libya mission for a year . 
`` Now is not the time to send the kind of mixed message that it sends when we are working with our allies to achieve the goals that we believe are widely shared in Congress , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said . 
`` The writing is on the wall for Colonel Gaddafi and now is not the time to let up . '' 
The congressional actions were another warning to Obama about growing discontent among lawmakers after a decade of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that have cost more than $ 1 trillion and have helped fuel a $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit . 
The United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission against Libya more than three months ago , aiming to prevent Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians in regions opposed to his rule . 
The U.N. authorized a no-fly zone and an arms embargo to put additional pressure on Gaddafi . 
The mission now appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power . 
The House , which is controlled by Republicans , voted 180-238 to reject the Republican measure to curb U.S. involvement in Libya . 
Eighty-nine Republicans joined Democrats in opposing it . 
Both House Speaker John Boehner and Representative Buck McKeon , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , had endorsed the measure . 
Boehner said the House was forced to act because Obama had failed to fulfill his obligation to consult with Congress . 
`` I support the removal of the Libyan regime ... , '' Boehner said . 
`` But when the president chooses to challenge the powers of the Congress , I , as speaker of this House , will defend the constitutional authority of the legislature . '' 
McKeon said the measure would continue to provide NATO with the essential backing it needed to carry out the mission while helping `` the president to be truthful in saying that we 're not engaged in hostile action . '' 
`` The president has repeatedly stated that the United States is not engaged in hostilities and that congressional authorization is not necessary to continue our role in this operation , '' McKeon added . 
`` I share with many of my colleagues the view that firing a missile at a target in a foreign nation does indeed constitute hostile action . '' 
Many lawmakers professed mixed feelings over the vote . 
Representative Mike Rogers , head of the House intelligence committee , backed the measure and criticized Obama 's failure to explain his Libya policy . 
But he added `` that does n't change the fact that the United States has important strategic interests in finishing the job there . '' 
A spokesman for Representative Mike Honda , a leading member of a bloc of left-leaning House Democrats , said the measure had failed because it amounted to a `` back door authorization '' of the Obama administration 's course of action , providing it with funding and legal authority for most of what it was already doing . 
The House voted 123-295 to reject the resolution that would have authorized Obama to continue with the limited U.S. mission in Libya for a year . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Absolutely , un-American by those members . 
It makes me sick . 
I 'm a long-time supporter of Obama , but this conflict in Libya makes me very uneasy . 
It goes against many of my core beliefs . 
It feels like delayed revenge for Lockerbie . 
The Republicans are all hypocritical and all political . 
I 'm beginning to think that an armed insurrection is the only answer . 
They are hostile toward the American government and the American Middle Class , just like al Qaeda is . 
And it 's not due to any real substantive dispute . 
It 's pure politics and lust for power . 
They use our country like a whore and when they get through with us there will be nothing left of this country . 
I think of all the posturing and political attacks the Republicans unleashed on the Democrats when they showed any reluctance to support their invasion of Iraq . 
Democrats were being unpatriotic , unAmerican . 
How dare the Democrats not join in with the American people to go after those who struck at the heart of our nation on 9\/11 , or so they 'd have us believe . 
Now look at them . 
At first they were criticizing Obama for doing too little too late . 
Now they 're refusing to give him any support for at all for merely giving a NATO-led mission some logistical support . 
Yet if there was a Republican in the White House they 'd be leading the charge . 
They are SO destructive and hypocritical .

NEW : Libyan state TV reports new NATO strikes in Gharyan , a city in western Libya NEW : An opposition spokesman faults Gadhafi for civilian deaths NATO airstrikes were also conducted in al-Brega The African Union will discuss avenues for peace Sunday Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO airstrikes hit a bakery and a restaurant in the Libyan city of al-Brega Saturday , killing 15 civilians , a Libyan government official told CNN , though the alliance countered that claim . 
NATO said it had struck key command-and-control centers . 
The alliance said there was `` no indication of civilian casualties in connection with these strikes . '' 
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces have occupied buildings in an abandoned area of al-Brega from where they are launching attacks on civilians , a NATO statement said . 
The alliance monitored the buildings and said it determined them to be clear military targets . 
`` This continues to show Gadhafi 's reprehensible tactics of placing military assets and operations at the heart of civilian neighborhoods , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , NATO commander for the Libya campaign . 
`` We have meticulously monitored these developments for a significant period and it was time to remove this threat , '' he said . 
Al-Brega is a key oil refinery town about 500 miles east of Tripoli that has been the scene of heavy fighting between pro-Gadhafi forces and rebel fighters . 
Abdul Hafiz Ghoga , a spokesman and deputy chairman of the opposition 's Transitional National Council , said Gadhafi bears a lot of the responsibility for civilian casualties in the fighting as the Libyan leader keeps weapons near where people live , echoing the comments of the NATO commander . 
Also Saturday , Libyan state TV said NATO strikes hit Gharyan , a city in the west . 
The report cited an unnamed military source who said a number of people were killed and wounded in the attack . 
CNN could not independently confirm the claim . 
Despite the airstrikes , an armed rebel movement and several high-profile defections , Gadhafi has held onto power . 
Seventeen prominent soccer players in Libya have defected , plus 38 military officers , including six high-ranking officers , according to Ghoga . 
Hopes for a political solution are at a stalemate over opposition conditions that Gadhafi must leave the country before any negotiated settlement can take hold . 
Libyan government officials have said repeatedly that Gadhafi 's departure can not be a prerequisite to talks . 
The African Union will try again Sunday to discuss a road map to quell the Libyan crisis . 
The African Union 's special committee on Libya , established in March , will convene in Pretoria , South Africa , to discuss avenues for peace . 
Over the last three months , panel members have met with both Gadhafi and opposition leaders . 
Ahead of the meeting , human rights activists urged the African Union to prioritize the issue of the plight of civilians caught in armed conflicts , including Libya . 
Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have blamed the Gadhafi regime for violations of human rights , including indiscriminate fire on civilians , the use of internationally banned cluster bombs and the torture and executions of captured fighters .

2011-06-25,"By the CNN Wire Staff The defecting soccer players were greeted by cheering crowds and celebratory gunfire in the rebel town of Zintan . 
The defections are another setback for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Some of the players are greeted by cheering crowds in Zintan Opposition spokesman says defections have a significance beyond the symbolic -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seventeen prominent soccer players in Libya have defected to the rebels , opposition spokesmen said Saturday , in another setback to the county 's embattled leadership . 
Some were former members of the national team . 
They arrived in the rebel stronghold of Zintan in western Libya Saturday afternoon to cheering crowds that greeted them with celebratory gunfire and smiles . 
Players posed with locals and briefly batted a soccer ball between their heads . 
`` I am telling Colonel -LRB- Moammar -RRB- Gadhafi to leave us alone and allow us to create a free Libya , '' goalkeeper Juma Gtat told BBC News earlier in the town of Jadu . 
`` In fact I wish he would leave this life altogether , '' Gtat said . 
The footballers ' defections come after a series of Libyan officials have done the same , increasing the pressure around Gadhafi to step down after more than four decades in power . 
Abdul Hafiz Ghoga , a spokesman and deputy chairman of the opposition 's Transitional National Council , said the players ' defections are important to the young people of Libya and have a significance beyond the symbolic . 
The athletes were en route to Mali , and announced their defections in Tunisia , according to Ghoga .

2011-06-26,"By the CNN Wire Staff South African President Jacob Zuma -LRB- R -RRB- chairs an African Union -LRB- AU -RRB- meeting on Libya in Pretoria on Sunday . 
NEW : South Africa 's president says civilian lives have been lost in NATO bombings NEW : AU : `` Only a political solution will make it possible to ... settle the current conflict '' Gadhafi will not be a part of talks , but it is unclear when they will occur , the AU says Libya says recent NATO strikes killed civilians , but NATO said there is no indication that it did so -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi will not be part of the African Union 's next attempt to map out a peace deal in the war-torn nation , the organization said in a statement Sunday . 
`` The AU high-level ad hoc committee welcomes Colonel Gadhafi 's acceptance of not being part of the negotiation process , '' the statement said . 
It was unclear who would represent the Libyan government in negotiations , or when negotiations would occur . 
Journalists were not allowed to ask questions at a news conference after Sunday 's meeting of the African Union 's special committee on Libya in Pretoria , South Africa . 
Members of the committee have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders over the past three months . 
Another African Union-led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in April . 
African Union holds Libya peace talks Waiting game on Libyan front House rejects restricting Libya funding Protesting for , against Gadhafi in Libya South African President Jacob Zuma told the committee Sunday that continued bombing by NATO and its allies was a `` concern , '' since protecting the Libyan people was the intention behind a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force in the North African nation . 
`` The intention was not to authorize a campaign for regime change or political assassination , '' he said . 
The committee repeated calls Sunday for a cease-fire between the Libyan government and rebels . 
`` Only a political solution will make it possible to sustainably settle the current conflict , '' the statement said . 
It also urged the temporary `` stopping of NATO bombings '' to allow delivery of humanitarian aid . 
`` Civilian lives have been lost due to these bombings , and civilian infrastructure has suffered untold damage , '' Zuma said . 
Ahead of Sunday 's meeting , human rights activists urged the African Union to prioritize the issue of the plight of civilians caught in armed conflicts , including Libya . 
The meeting followed claims a day earlier by the Libyan government that NATO warplanes bombed a bakery and a restaurant in a key oil refinery town east of Tripoli , a charge the alliance has countered . 
Gadhafi has been a strong supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way . 
Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council , which is headed by Lamamra . 
The African Union 's committee on Libya includes representatives from Mauritania , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Mali , Uganda and South Africa . 
Opposition leaders had voiced doubt that any mediation involving that multinational group would end the conflict in a way that would satisfy their goals , which include Gadhafi 's ouster . 
In its proposed agreement in April , the African Union said Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop all hostilities and allow outside forces to help keep the peace . 
But rebels rejected the non-binding proposal , saying it did not address whether Gadhafi would step down or provide any solution to the violence against the Libyan people . 
Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have blamed the Gadhafi regime for violations of human rights , including indiscriminate fire on civilians , the use of internationally banned cluster bombs and the torture and executions of captured fighters . 
On Sunday , an International Committee of the Red Cross ship arrived in Tripoli from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi with about 100 people on board . 
It was the second time in a week that the ICRC has reunited friends and families between the the eastern opposition-controlled city and the western regime-controlled city . 
NATO began bombing military targets in March after the U.N. Security Council issued a resolution authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . 
Libya accused NATO on Saturday of killing civilians in airstrikes , with NATO responding that it struck key command-and-control centers .

2011-06-28,"By the CNN Wire Staff Misrata cheers Gadhafi arrest warrant NEW : Rebels attack a weapons depot near the western city of Zintan Prosecutor says he ca n't prove Gadhafi ordered rapes in Libya 's civil war The court issued arrest warrants for Gadhafi on other charges Monday Libyan civilians are writing `` Thank you , NATO '' on their roofs , a general says -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The International Criminal Court is still trying to link Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , his son and his brother-in-law to rapes , but it does not yet have enough evidence to do so , prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday . 
It has evidence that rapes have taken place in Libya 's civil war , he said , but he can not prove Gadhafi ordered them . 
The court issued arrest warrants Monday for Gadhafi , his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi on other charges . 
Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi is a close adviser to his father . 
His arrest warrant came two days after his 39th birthday . 
Al-Sanussi serves as Gadhafi 's head of intelligence . 
The warrants are `` for crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution , `` allegedly committed across Libya '' from February 15 through `` at least '' February 28 , `` through the state apparatus and security forces , '' the court said in a news release . 
The court could file charges against `` one or two other names , but in principle the first investigation focuses on these individuals , '' Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday . 
The court is not asking international forces operating in Libya to arrest the suspects , he said , explaining that Libya has the primary responsibility to do so as a United Nations member . 
NATO confirmed in a news conference that it is not seeking to arrest anyone , as that is not part of its mission . 
Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard of NATO gave a mixed assessment of the mission to protect civilians , saying Libyans were writing `` Thank you , NATO '' on their roofs . 
But , he said , Gadhafi 's forces were using civilians as human shields , making NATO operations `` more difficult , but not impossible . '' 
Court issues Gadhafi arrest warrant Back to school in Misrata Libyan families reunited in war And he said NATO had reports that government forces had `` put down very severely '' attempts to demonstrate against Gadhafi 's rule . 
`` Security forces continue to inflict pain and harm on the population , '' Bouchard said at a briefing in Naples , Italy , where Operation Unified Protector is based . 
NATO struck civilian and military locations in the Badr Al-Osta Milad area of Tripoli on Tuesday , Libyan state TV reported without further details . 
Elsewhere Tuesday , rebels attacked a government weapons depot some 30 kilometers south of Zintan , an opposition stronghold in western Libya . 
It was a location that had previously been a target of NATO attacks . 
Two people died and four were injured in the fighting , according to Khalid Shhop , a doctor stationed at the depot . 
Rebels overtook government forces and were later seen carting away ammunition , he said . 
At the International Criminal Court , Moreno-Ocampo insisted it is only a matter of time until Gadhafi is arrested , pointing out that Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic was finally seized more than 15 years after a warrant for his arrest was issued . 
`` The arrest warrants are not going away , '' he said , noting that 161 warrants had been issued in connection with the Yugoslav wars of the early 1990s -- and that 160 suspects have been seized . 
Libyan rebels could also face arrest warrants , Moreno-Ocampo said . 
But `` by far the greatest crimes committed in Libya are committed by the Gadhafi forces , '' he said , explaining why the court investigation began with them . 
And he batted away questions from reporters about whether an ICC arrest warrant would discourage Gadhafi from stepping down , saying the decision to investigate him came from a unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution , not the court . 
It was `` not our idea , '' he said . 
In rebel-held Misrata , where fighting has raged , a crowd cheered Monday following the announcement of the arrest warrants . 
The announcement at The Hague came as fighting inside Libya inched closer to the capital . 
A rebel fighter , Hassan al-Jiwali , told CNN that rebel forces were 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- from Tripoli on Monday . 
Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the international court 's authority , but Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday it still had a responsibility to arrest Gadhafi and his allies because it is a member of the United Nations , which ordered the investigation . 
He said the rebels could also arrest Gadhafi and hand him over . 
The court does not have the power to enter Libya and arrest the leaders . 
The U.N. Security Council referred the matter to the ICC through a resolution February 26 , following widespread complaints about Gadhafi 's efforts to crush a rebellion . 
The resolution said that , while `` states not party to the Rome Statute have no obligations under the statute , the Security Council urged all states and concerned regional and other international organizations to cooperate fully with the court and the prosecutor . '' 
Gadhafi 's backers rejected the court 's authority . 
`` This court is nothing but a cover to the military operations of NATO , '' said Libyan Justice Minister Mohammed Al Qamod . 
`` It is merely a political tool for exerting pressure and political blackmail against sovereign countries . '' 
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Ka'eem offered a similar view . 
`` Both the International Criminal Court and the chief prosecutor have neither the legal competence nor the moral compass in any way to pass judgment on anyone , let alone the Libyan people , '' he said . 
Michael Rubin , an analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said the court 's move could damage efforts to get Gadhafi to end his 42-year reign , because he would not seek refuge in a country that is a party or signatory to the Rome Statute . 
`` The ICC 's arrest warrant symbolizes the dirty underside of international law , '' Rubin said . 
`` While the ICC makes itself feel good and diplomats can chatter about their commitment to international law , the fact of the matter is their action takes off the table any possibility that Gadhafi could flee to a retirement haven outside Libya . 
In effect , the ICC arrest warrant tells Gadhafi to fight to the death . '' 
Most African countries are parties or signatories to the Rome Statute . 
The ICC website lists a total of 47 non-signatories in the world , 13 of them in Africa and the Middle East .

2011-06-28,"WASHINGTON | Tue Jun 28 , 2011 6:30 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday approved a resolution formally authorizing continued U.S. participation in the NATO-led military intervention in Libya but banning the introduction of U.S. troops on the ground there . 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote marked another round in the debate in Washington over who has the power to make war , sparked by the President Barack Obama 's decision to commit the United States to the Libya conflict in March without asking the U.S. Congress ' approval . 
The committee voted 14-5 to approve the measure offered by Senator John Kerry , a Democrat , and Senator John McCain , a Republican , both supporters of the Libya intervention . 
But the House of Representatives has already rejected a similar measure , reflecting the division in Congress over the issue and narrowing the chances that the Kerry-McCain resolution , which first has to be approved by the full Senate , will ever become law . 
While the Obama administration would like Congress to express support for the Libya mission , it says it does not strictly need formal authorization by Congress . 
This is because the U.S. military role in the NATO-led Libya operations has been limited , not rising to the level of war or `` hostilities '' under U.S. law , U.S. officials say . 
This legalistic position , which was explained again to the committee in detail earlier Tuesday by State Department lawyer Harold Koh , has angered or annoyed many in both parties in Congress -- even some of those who support the Libya action . 
Before passing the resolution , the senators effectively repudiated the administration 's argument by adopting an amendment that said continuation of the Libya operations does require congressional authorization . 
ALL THOSE WHO VOTED NO WERE REPUBLICANS The United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission in March , aiming to prevent Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians opposed to his rule . 
The mission , NATO-led since the end of March , now appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power . 
The panel 's vote in favor of the resolution was a bipartisan 10 Democrats and four Republicans . 
All those who voted against the measure were Republicans , including the panel 's top Republican , Richard Lugar , who cited the U.S. debt and two other wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as reasons not to wage war in Libya . 
`` In light of these circumstances , the lack of U.S. vital interest in Libya , I do not believe that we should be intervening in a civil war there , '' Lugar said . 
Kerry said that now was not the time to bail out of Libya , with Gaddafi `` bunkered down in Tripoli '' and facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court . 
`` Do we want to stop this operation ? 
That 's really what it comes down to , '' Kerry said ahead of the vote . 
The resolution would authorize the U.S. role in Libya for up to one year after the date of enactment of the resolution by Congress , unless the NATO mission ends sooner . 
It also says that the removal of Gaddafi is a political goal of U.S. policy , and calls for the United States and NATO to be reimbursed for the costs of the operation from assets seized from Gaddafi 's government . 
Senator Bob Corker , a Republican who voted against the resolution , said the administration was basically `` sticking a stick in the eye '' of Congress by finding a narrow legal reason not to ask for authorization . 
`` The chairman mentioned -LRB- that -RRB- since no American is being shot , there 's no hostilities . 
By that reasoning we could drop a nuclear bomb on Tripoli and we would not be involved in hostilities , and this goes to the sort of preposterous argument that is being made , '' Corker said . 
Senator Jim Webb , a Democrat , agreed the administration 's argument that the Libyan conflict is not `` hostilities '' was `` contorted , '' but he voted for the authorization resolution . 
Koh , in his appearance before the committee , declined to comment on reports that Obama ignored the advice of Pentagon and Justice Department lawyers who argued that U.S. military intervention in Libya required congressional authorization . 
Since NATO took over the Libya operation on March 31 , the United States has conducted 755 strike sorties , including 119 in which the planes fired at targets . 
Thirty-nine of the strikes involved the use of drone aircraft . 
The United States has also been providing reconnaissance , refueling , planning and other services to the NATO-led mission . 
The committee voted down , 14-5 , a proposal by Lugar that would have ruled out U.S. participation in any more air strikes .

2011-06-29,"Libyan rebels carry away a comrade wounded during fighting with forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on June 7 . 
An air war alone is not enough , say some analysts But without ground troops , what is the end game ? 
Some fear a protracted war that could go on for months A Libyan analyst says self-determination is key -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was supposed to have been over in a few days . 
World powers would go in with fighter jets and the world 's most sophisticated precision-guided weapons to render Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi powerless . 
But that 's not the way things happened . 
As NATO 's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark , analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions , including success based solely on surgical airstrikes , for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months . 
`` It 's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this , '' said Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation and director of Aberfoyle International Security , a Toronto-based agency specializing in security issues related to the Islamic world . 
The basic problem , McGregor said , stemmed from presuppositions about the fortitude of the Libyan opposition . 
It 's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this . 
-- Andrew McGregor , director of Aberfoyle International Security . 
Buoyed by the successful uprisings to the east in Egypt and to the west in Tunisia , Libyan rebels believed they had the mettle to bring down Gadhafi . 
Western powers believed that with a little help , Libya could be freed from totalitarian rule . 
But rebels launched an armed insurrection against a man who had spent four long decades preparing his state for unforeseen challenges . 
This was n't a peaceful revolution of the masses against a government that had no public support . 
`` This revolt never really had the strength to succeed , '' McGregor said . 
`` There was this feeling among the rebels that all we have to do is show up . 
But you should take a couple of years to get it organized first . 
If you 're just going to run out on the streets , the results will be predictable . '' 
Four months on , the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves , McGregor said . 
They are out of fuel , oil production has shut down , and they have few available resources . 
They will soon face even shortages of food and water , McGregor said . 
President Barack Obama faces pressure at home to withdraw U.S. forces . 
There is debate , too , in Europe over the expensive air campaign . 
The war may have been morally right , but NATO , said McGregor , is facing a conundrum . 
Part of that failure was a lack of consideration of the makeup of the Libyan population , said University of Texas political scientist Alan J. Kuperman , author of `` The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention . '' 
`` The fundamental error by the White House and NATO was to imagine that the Libyan people were united in opposition to Gadhafi , '' he said . 
`` In reality , Libya is divided along lines of clan and tribe , some of whom benefit greatly from Gadhafi , and therefore defend him fiercely , '' he said . 
`` Any expert on ethnic conflict and intervention could have told the White House that ahead of time . '' 
In that respect , said Thomas Donnelly , director of the Center for Defense Studies , the Libyan war has the potential for fallout that is worse than what happened after President George W. Bush declared `` mission accomplished '' weeks after Saddam Hussein 's 2003 ouster in the Iraq war . 
`` To imagine that Libyans are going to come together -- is a hope , but not a plan , '' Donnelly said . 
`` It was a mistake to get involved in such a feckless way . '' 
Behind the rhetorical rallying cry of protecting civilians , Donnelly said , has always been the real aim of NATO -- to kill Gadhafi . 
`` If you made me bet my mortgage at gunpoint , I 'd say we probably will get Gadhafi , '' he said . 
But the question is when . 
And if it does n't happen in a timely fashion , then NATO risks the erosion of public support for its campaign , Donnelly said . 
`` In some sense , 100 days is a short period of time , '' he said . 
`` But when your political support is so tenuous and thin , and when your operations have heretofore been ineffective in achieving campaign goals , then taking ground forces off the table has not made the war any shorter or any less bloody . '' 
The Libyan regime has also proven itself to be more robust and resilient than anyone imagined . 
It would be a mistake , said Donnelly , to assume that killing Gadhafi would mean a collapse of the entire system . 
The Libya conflict has sometimes been compared to NATO 's air war in the Balkans in the 1990s . 
Many people thought the Serbs would go down instantly once NATO began bombing . 
And eventually , it was the threat of a ground invasion that led to the capitulation of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic . 
Gadhafi , however , faces no such threat . 
And some believe the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court this week will only help strengthen his resolve to stay in power . 
`` If Barack Obama had thought a hundred days ago that he would be where he is now , you have to wonder whether he would have made the same decision , '' Donnelly said . 
`` How can you tell the American people we 're going to start jumping over the fence and we have no idea where we are going to come down ? '' 
But not everyone is pessimistic about prospects in Libya . 
Ali Ahmida , for one , stands by his belief that the Libyan opposition can defeat Gadhafi . 
The rebels , he said , have made noticeable gains with the support of NATO air power . 
He cited recent rebel takeovers of western towns in the Nafusa Mountains and said Gadhafi is more isolated now than ever before . 
`` The Libyan people are capable of fighting this fight , '' said Ahmida , an analyst at the University of New England . 
`` The consequences of this , even though it is more painful and brutal , will have a positive outcome in the end . '' 
It has not been easy for Ahmida to watch the conflict unfold in Libya . 
But he is a strong proponent for self-determination who feels strongly that the Libyan people , not outside forces , must determine their fate . 
`` I warned against this from the start , that Libyan public opinion would not like it , '' he said , referring to the possibility of foreign boots on the ground . 
And Ahmida still questions the motivation of Western powers and the agendas of exiles who he fears may want to exploit oil-rich Libya . 
`` I 'm optimistic but guarded , '' he said . 
Ahmida said the bad news is that NATO lacked clarity in its mission and also in a negotiated exit for Gadhafi , which he said is more difficult now because of the arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity . 
Still , Gadhafi 's regime will fall , he said . 
Then the real battle for the future of Libya will just be starting .

2011-06-30,"Women in Libya are training to defend Moammar Gadhafi 's regime Women training with weapons is not an uncommon sight in Libya Masoud : `` I liked training and defending my country '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is calling for fresh volunteers in a months-long war with rebels attempting to bring about an end to his 42-year rule -- and women of all ages are answering , CNN has learned . 
Women from in and around Gadhafi 's stronghold of Tripoli have been traveling south to a training facility in Bani Walid to practice with weapons , a common sight in a country where young girls receive military training in schools . 
As NATO 's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark and rebels continue to fight to oust Gadhafi , he is tapping everything and everyone in his arsenal to hold on to power . 
At the training facility in Bani Walid , women are training to `` defend Moammar and the country , '' said Sgt. Faraj Ramadan , a woman who is training other women to properly handle weapons . 
`` They train to use it , assemble it and take it apart , and to shoot , '' she told CNN recently . 
`` They were trained and got excellent scores . '' 
At a recent graduation at the facility , 40-year-old Fatima Masoud said she liked the training . 
She said she left her textile job every day at 4 p.m. to train . 
`` I liked training and defending my country , and now I 'm am training women from all ages to use weapons , '' she said . 
It is unclear how many have answered Gadhafi 's call or how many had graduated from the program at Bani Walid . 
But women are fighting alongside government forces . 
A woman , who did not want to identified , fresh from the frontlines , attended the graduation . 
She was still wearing a cannula in her wrist . 
`` Do not underestimate any woman in Libya , whether old or young , '' the woman said . 
`` The woman is still able to perform more than you think . '' 
Gadhafi 's government claims it has handed out more than a million weapons to civilians since the uprising began . 
CNN can not independently verify the claim .

As NATO 's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark , analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions , including success based solely on surgical airstrikes , for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months . 
`` It 's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this , '' said Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation and director of Aberfoyle International Security , a Toronto-based agency specializing in security issues related to the Islamic world . 
The basic problem , McGregor said , stemmed from presuppositions about the fortitude of the Libyan opposition . 
Buoyed by the successful uprisings to the east in Egypt and to the west in Tunisia , Libyan rebels believed they had the mettle to bring down Gadhafi . 
Western powers believed that with a little help , Libya could be freed from totalitarian rule . 
But rebels launched an armed insurrection against a man who had spent four long decades preparing his state for unforeseen challenges . 
This was n't a peaceful revolution of the masses against a government that had no public support . 
`` This revolt never really had the strength to succeed , '' McGregor said . 
`` There was this feeling among the rebels that all we have to do is show up . 
But you should take a couple of years to get it organized first . 
If you 're just going to run out on the streets , the results will be predictable . '' 
Four months on , the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves , McGregor said . 
They are out of fuel , oil production has shut down , and they have few available resources . 
They will soon face even shortages of food and water , McGregor said . 
President Barack Obama faces pressure at home to withdraw U.S. forces . 
There is debate , too , in Europe over the expensive air campaign . 
The war may have been morally right , but NATO , said McGregor , is facing a conundrum . 
Part of that failure was a lack of consideration of the makeup of the Libyan population , said University of Texas political scientist Alan J. Kuperman , author of `` The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention . '' 
`` The fundamental error by the White House and NATO was to imagine that the Libyan people were united in opposition to Gadhafi , '' he said . 
`` In reality , Libya is divided along lines of clan and tribe , some of whom benefit greatly from Gadhafi , and therefore defend him fiercely , '' he said . 
`` Any expert on ethnic conflict and intervention could have told the White House that ahead of time . '' 
In that respect , said Thomas Donnelly , director of the Center for Defense Studies , the Libyan war has the potential for fallout that is worse than what happened after President George W. Bush declared `` mission accomplished '' weeks after Saddam Hussein 's 2003 ouster in the Iraq war . 
`` To imagine that Libyans are going to come together - is a hope , but not a plan , '' Donnelly said . 
`` It was a mistake to get involved in such a feckless way . '' 
Behind the rhetorical rallying cry of protecting civilians , Donnelly said , has always been the real aim of NATO - to kill Gadhafi . 
`` If you made me bet my mortgage at gunpoint , I 'd say we probably will get Gadhafi , '' he said . 
But the question is when . 
And if it does n't happen in a timely fashion , then NATO risks the erosion of public support for its campaign , Donnelly said . 
`` In some sense , 100 days is a short period of time , '' he said . 
`` But when your political support is so tenuous and thin , and when your operations have heretofore been ineffective in achieving campaign goals , then taking ground forces off the table has not made the war any shorter or any less bloody . '' 
The Libyan regime has also proven itself to be more robust and resilient than anyone imagined . 
It would be a mistake , said Donnelly , to assume that killing Gadhafi would mean a collapse of the entire system . 
The Libya conflict has sometimes been compared to NATO 's air war in the Balkans in the 1990s . 
Many people thought the Serbs would go down instantly once NATO began bombing . 
And eventually , it was the threat of a ground invasion that led to the capitulation of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic . 
Gadhafi , however , faces no such threat . 
And some believe the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court this week will only help strengthen his resolve to stay in power . 
`` If Barack Obama had thought a hundred days ago that he would be where he is now , you have to wonder whether he would have made the same decision , '' Donnelly said . 
`` How can you tell the American people we 're going to start jumping over the fence and we have no idea where we are going to come down ? '' 
But not everyone is pessimistic about prospects in Libya . 
Ali Ahmida , for one , stands by his belief that the Libyan opposition can defeat Gadhafi . 
The rebels , he said , have made noticeable gains with the support of NATO air power . 
He cited recent rebel takeovers of western towns in the Nafusa Mountains and said Gadhafi is more isolated now than ever before . 
`` The Libyan people are capable of fighting this fight , '' said Ahmida , an analyst at the University of New England . 
`` The consequences of this , even though it is more painful and brutal , will have a positive outcome in the end . '' 
It has not been easy for Ahmida to watch the conflict unfold in Libya . 
But he is a strong proponent for self-determination who feels strongly that the Libyan people , not outside forces , must determine their fate . 
`` I warned against this from the start , that Libyan public opinion would not like it , '' he said , referring to the possibility of foreign boots on the ground . 
And Ahmida still questions the motivation of Western powers and the agendas of exiles who he fears may want to exploit oil-rich Libya . 
`` I 'm optimistic but guarded , '' he said . 
Ahmida said the bad news is that NATO lacked clarity in its mission and also in a negotiated exit for Gadhafi , which he said is more difficult now because of the arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity . 
Still , Gadhafi 's regime will fall , he said . 
Then the real battle for the future of Libya will just be starting . 
Oh -- So there is a war going on in Libya ? 
According to President Obama there `` are very little hostilities '' . 
I never thought I ` dd be saying this but I am rooting for Moammar Ghadhafi . 
Until President Obama gets authorization from congress I consider him a war criminal . 
June 30 , 2011 at 11:06 am | Reply I totally agree with you , Galtinator . 
75 % of all the civilian deaths in Libya are caused by the NATO air strikes and do n't let the right-wing media kid you otherwise ! 
Besides , anyone with half a brain would know that since the Libyan air force has been virtually eliminated early in the conflict . 
June 30 , 2011 at 4:12 pm | Reply 75 % ehmm ehmm -LRB- clearing throat -RRB- Where did you get your numbers ? 
I 'm libyan and what you are saying is 100 % crap . 
I would like to see where you get your info ... Gadhafi is a dictator and a murderer who sends libyans to get killed all the time for decades . 
Women are being raped and children killed . 
I understand what a war means ... I guess that 's something you probably wo n't , but in a war thousands of people will die for sure -LRB- from both sides -RRB- but the outcome at least will end all the killings . 
Gadhafi 's people are telling everyone that NATO is killing more so NATO gets out . 
Now , I 'm not a big supporter of NATO either because I do n't trust their interests , but as long as Gadhafi dissapears forever then I 'm happy . 
Believe me , at least 10,000 people have been killed by Gadhafi and it is not just NOW , it has been going on ever since he took power . 
The whole country lives in poverty and people die from poverty while Gadhafi 's family enjoys their billions and makes 5 million dollar parties all the time . 
July 1 , 2011 at 7:11 pm | Are n't the Rebels part of the French Foreign Legion ? 
Doubt they really care if civilians die as long as France gets the oil . 
You can not honestly tell me France has not signed oil contracts already . 
Even the blind can see that , Rebels are puppets . 
I do not support Gadhafi but I the rebels are not clean either , support 1 dictator to replace another not going to happen . 
July 1 , 2011 at 8:49 pm | How many male personnel that are in Libya right now that are not fighting for or against Gadaffi ? 
How many are not doing anything at all ? 
Why the hell would people even consider to have foreign ground troops to fall on that field ? 
Why do n't the Libyan men actually get off their behinds and do something ? 
I know a lot are , but if they were to get everyone on board then it would be a finished project . 
Anyways , the end result would be ... Libya did not overthrow Gadaffi , NATO and the US did so they can not claim that .

That type of transformation seems to happen to anyone in the White House , regardless of party . 
We never should have gotten involved there . 
Europe got involved because it did n't want Libyan refugees but this is not our problem . 
In fact , we should get out of NATO entirely , as General Petraus suggested when he said only the US is covering the huge costs .

July 22 , 2011 at 10:39 am | I agree that the air strikes were a stupid mistake . 
Air power alone has never decided the outcome of a conflict . 
Example : Britian survived th Blitz , Germany survived 5 years of allied bombing , Iraq survived the coalition air strikes . 
Now , France is dropping arms to the rebels in violation of the arms embargo . 
What a mess !! Remember what happened in Cuba ?? The world supported Castro in taking over Cuba then he turned out to be a communist stooge . 
Stop the bombing and let them settle their internal affairs .

American administration officials would ignore any warrants for arrest from the ICC as well , and you can be sure that American friendly governments would also not honor the warrant . 
If China were to start lobbying missles and bombs on Taiwan the USA would consider it an Act of War .

Most American people who disagree with the war -LRB- incl . 
the ones in Congress , with the exception of , perhaps , Dennis Kucinich -RRB- are just saying that `` we can not afford it '' , while still believen that US\/NATO has `` upper moral hand '' to liberate Libya from brutal dictator . 
In reality it appears that a significant portion of Libyans actually like Gaddafi . 
Just picture this : Gaddafi rides standing in open truck during a rally in Tripoli , and all men in the cheering crowd have AK-47 and franticly shooting them into the air . 
Well , this is how Arabs express their happiness . 
Now imagine anybody from Western leaders , say Obama or Sarcozy or George W. riding in an open truck surrounded by the crowd of cheering supporters all armed with M-16s and shooting them into the air franticly . 
The truth is that it would take only one supporter among a thousand to point his AK-47 not to the air , but a bit more horizontal . 
and that would be the end of Gaddaffi . 
Still , he does not seem to afraid .

July 1 , 2011 at 12:34 pm | We all know how difficult it is to predict the outcome of an armed conflict , especially when there are so many parties involved . 
As we know , human beings are so unpredictable and the actions uncontrollable . 
At the beginning it looked llike an impetuous act as the rebels , got carried away by their peers in Tunisia and Egypt took to the streets . 
Hundred days later , after a bloody hard lesson and casualties they have shown themselves organised and disciplined . 
Despite the airstrikes from the NATO they still have n't gained much ground . 
I do n't share their optimism that the whole conflict will be over in 4 weeks , by the break of the Ramadam . 
June 30 , 2011 at 11:39 am | Reply Why do you think that rooting for Gaddafi is rooting for the dark side ? 
What they fail to talk about is WHY Gaddafi has such fierce loyalty . 
He modernized libya , made life for the poorest tribes better , made women 's rights the best in the region and made it so Libya is one of 2 or 3 countries in Africa to have an above average per capita GDP . 
The Rebels are sporting a MONARCHIST flag , and the ideas of the Monarch who Gaddafi overthrough over 40 years ago approximately matchl the ideas of the Saudi Monrachs . 
If the rebels win , you can be sure that women 's rights will be trampled , the poorer tibes will be excluded from oil profits and large parts of the country will be left in poverty while tribal elites live like Saudi Royalty . 
This is better for the West , because it is far easier to extract cheap oil from a corrupt tribal regime .

July 1 , 2011 at 12:39 pm | Reply Listen guy , I am a Libyan citizen and lived with this regime 42 years , you have no ideas what so ever about this corrupted person , since day one when he took the power , illegally and by force , he confiscated all the resources to serve himself and his family and very close circle of loyalist to him , he destroyed everything , he found a wealthy democratic country with parliament and well written constitution , excellent health care systems and very advanced educational institutions , he eliminated everything , he jailed thousands of educated peoples , killed hundreds of students and innocent citizens , attacked neighbouring countries such as Chad , Egypt , Sudan , and Tunisia . 
He confiscated people s properties and destroyed successful businesses and well established private sector . 
In brief he converted Libya to his own private property and all the people just became slaves to him and his children and his tribe . 
If you don t believe this go and read about Libya in the US Congress archive or even in the archive of Ghadafi himself , everything is documented . 
He is criminal and thief , the history will say his word and shall tell us the truth , the truth about who bring this cancer to destroy Libya ?

First of all : The KINGDOM OF LIBYA which gaddafi ended in 1969 was definetly not a democracy . 
It was a western backed monarchy run by a cyrinaican tribal elder . 
Second , King Idris was the one who actually developed a huge s fortune from oil sails to the West . 
Next , women 's rights in libya were severely limitted prior to 1969 because of the conservative nature of the monarchy . 
Gaddafi has allowed women to move up in government and business -LRB- which is why so many of them are willing to fight for him now -RRB- , he created a wonderful healthcare system -LRB- the life expectancy in libya is the same as in the US ! 
unheard of anywhere else in africa -RRB- He developed the poorest tribes . 
The problem is that he had to nationalize the wealth that tribal elders from the old regime hoarded , This created a lot of bitterness which is being played out right now .

Libya is the same story , just a bit smaller .

The solution , of course , is to put boots-on-the-ground . 
If they had send it the special forces troops to work with the rebels to locate targets and coordinate air support like they did in Afghanistan . 
This would have made CAS the standard approach and created casualty rates in Gadaffi s troops enough to break them , same as in Aghanistan , and all the cities would be in rebel hands by now . 
Gadaffi and his remaining supports would be dead , captured , or hiding in the desert plotting a guerrilla campaign that is none of our concern .

If Ghadaffi and sons had kept their mouths shut and had n't made speeches about hunting the ` rats ' down and ` fighting to the last man ' they may well have gotten away with their repression of a not-very-well-planned uprising . 
However , its too late for that now . 
This may take a while yet , but momentum and initiative are on the side of the rebels . 
NATO strikes will never be enough by themselves , but they are serving to draw down Ghadaffi assets and prevent his troops from conducting co-ordinated mass counterattacks .

Even after we destroyed Libya 's air defenses they still can not get it done . 
They wanted military intervention to protect Libya 's oil , which mainly goes to Europe , not to the US . 
Obama allowed the US to be used as the proxy military for France and Italy , and it was all about oil .

Unfortunately , the situation does n't call for the type of aerial bombardment that could do it . 
We did it to Japan in WWII , Vietnam is another good example and what we did in Kosovo worked very well . 
The type of bombardment necessary would target not only gov ' t installations , but also power stations , bridges and civilian buildings that may be harboring Libyan military or gov ' t officials . 
These are the types of targets that will destroy a country within weeks .

If the United States invaded Libya , without simply using drones and airpower -LRB- because you still hear of rebels moving back from areas they 've gained control of , because NATO is trying to pretend they are not on the rebel 's side even though they clearly are -RRB- , Gadhafi would be out of power . 
NATO and the United States are strong military forces , yet , Gadhafi is still in power . 
They 're not using their full resources to stop Gadhafi . 
He 's not a target . 
Unlike George W. Bush , which was more aggressive and was determined to go into Iraq even if no one was at his side , Obama is walking too fine a line . 
It 's a little annoying . 
And this is coming from a Democrat who 's hated Bush before and after reading more into why we went into Iraq and Afghanistan .

The Western media for quite some time has utilised Gaddafi s eccentricities to portray him as mad . 
In reflecting on how this war in Libya has progressed , I , however , have reason to doubt the sanity of some Western leaders . 
The war has been advanced by mainly three NATO nations , America , France and Britain . 
Obama , while bombing Libya has professed that this is not a war . 
With stunning linguistic gymnastics , the war has somersaulted from the feet first war to a head over heels support mission and merely an intervention . 
I must now conclude that if I dislike my neighbor and start throwing Molotov cocktails on his roof and stones into his windows , I am not at war with him , but in an effort to have him remove from the neighborhood , I am involved in a support mission and have merely intervened across the fence into his property . 
Sounds like a defense , then once I run it , I would have provided the Judge a good reason to order a psychiatric examination . 
Sarkozy , for his part , is faced with a UN Resolution which prohibits the supply of arms to Libya . 
He then in seeking to enforce the UN Resolution supplies arms to the rebels , while professing to be upholding that UN Resolution . 
Candidate number two for mental status assessment . 
In Britain , by parity of reason , one must assume that if a community took up arms , set up its own central bank , professed itself the new legitimate government of the UK , then for consistency , David Cameron , would simply fold his arms and direct that the British army not suppress the rebellion ? 
Absolutely , because , no doubt , he would have to be politically consistent with his conduct in Libya now , would he ? 
On the 1st of July , and after 3 months of bombardment of Libya by NATO , several thousand people have marched in the streets of Tripoli in support of Gadaffi , yet in the words of Cameron : - As I ve said , we will help fulfill the UN Security Council -LRB- resolution -RRB- it is for the Libyan people to determine their government and their destiny . 
But our view is clear there is no decent future for Libya with Colonel Gaddafi remaining in power . 
-LRB- The world can not -RRB- stand aside while this dictator murders his own people . 
So , there are no equivalent public mass rallies in Benghazi of any size , and yet Gadaffi s own people come out in mass support of their leader , but we can not forget what Obama said : - Muammar Gaddafi has lost the legitimacy to lead and he must leave , '' and that Cameron and Obama are of one mind . 
All three leaders are , of course , on a humanitarian mission . 
And to implement same , one drops bombs relentlessly on the Libyan people , who then come out in mass support of their leader and demand that the NATO bombing stops . 
But , as we know , Obama , Sarkozy and Cameron are all great humanitarians and thus they shall not relent from the humanitarian bombing for accomplishment of the noble humanitarian mission of removing the leader who over a million people want , while insisting that a leadership that no one ever heard of before is installed in power to uphold the democratic wishes of the Libyan people . 
P.S. I note now that you tube is busy , yet again , blocking the videos showing the size of the pro-Gadaffi demonstrations . 
Of course , we have freedom of expression here in the West .

July 5 , 2011 at 1:19 pm | Reply The only way to really end the Libyan war is to get rid of Gadhafi . 
If he 's taken out with a missile or just a rock it will be the deciding factor . 
He 's the one who 's run the nation like a dictator and has made a small group of fanatics powerful enough to rule by his will . 
His rule has to do with him controlling the oil and anything financial in the country . 
Helping those of neighboring countries who only want the same kind of power he has within their own borders has created an army of mercenaries . 
With Gadhafi gone , his group that runs the nation would lose it 's muster , power , everything . 
Only then will Libya be able to control its own fate . 
Maybe if the UN just put a bounty on him a few of his mercenaries might change their minds and chose to retire in comfort . 
July 3 , 2011 at 10:00 pm | Reply I think the world has forgotten that waging war is basically a bloody and ruthless mess . 
There is nothing `` humanitarian '' in war . 
While waging war is decisive to win , a fighter does n't enter a ring thinking he can talk the opponent into submission , in the end it 's about getting him to submit with pain or knocking him senseless to the point that he 's physically broke . 
I 'm sorry but a part of me feels that if those who wanted Gadhafi removed would just gather their forces and pound him into the stone-age it might save more lives in the end and be more economical . 
While he continues to punch without gloves on and we go in with our gloved hands tied behind our back , he 's going to stay in power and you can bet he utilizes this as a tactic .

A basic truth though is that air campaign can continue for years and still cost only a small fraction of the daily expense of having ground forces directly involved . 
The conflict will end when all the men with power in the Gaddafi family are dead or when the casualties on both sides of the conflict has worn down the resistance to compromise . 
The conflict at its core is not that much different than the current budget standoff in Congress , which may too result in deaths before it is over .

2011-06-30,"TRIPOLI | Thu Jun 30 , 2011 6:18 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Russia accused France on Thursday of committing a `` crude violation '' of a U.N. weapons embargo by arming Libyan rebels , while Washington said it was acting legally , creating a new diplomatic dispute over the Western air war . 
France confirmed on Wednesday that it had air-dropped arms to rebels in Libya 's Western Mountains , becoming the first NATO country to acknowledge openly arming the insurgency against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . 
France , Britain and the United States are leading a three-month-old air campaign which they say they will not end until Gaddafi falls . 
The war has become the bloodiest of the `` Arab Spring '' uprisings sweeping North Africa and the Middle East . 
Rebels acknowledged French support , saying it had helped sustain them in the region . 
`` There should be no doubt that Libyans in the Nafusa Mountain -LRB- Western Mountains -RRB- area are alive and safe today thanks to a combination of heroic Libyan bravery and French wisdom and support , '' Vice Chairman Abdul Hafeedh Ghoga of the Transitional National Council said in a statement of thanks to French President Nicolas Sarkozy . 
Though rebel advances have been slow , the insurgents scored a success in the region on Sunday in pushing to the outskirts of Bir al-Ghanam , within 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- of Tripoli . 
On Thursday the rebels surveyed the strategic town from a ridge overlooking the desert plateau that leads to the capital , in preparation for a possible attack . 
A Reuters journalist with them said they were waiting for NATO airstrikes to help them . 
Libyan television broadcast a statement from tribal leaders condemning Sarkozy over the arms , calling the rebels in the Berber area `` a product of France . '' 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow `` asked our French colleagues today whether reports that weapons from France were delivered to Libyan rebels correspond with reality . '' 
`` If this is confirmed , it is a very crude violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970 , '' he said . 
That resolution , adopted in February , imposed a comprehensive arms embargo . 
Paris said on Wednesday it believed it had not violated the U.N. embargo because the weapons it gave the rebels were needed to protect civilians from an imminent attack , which it says is allowed under a later Security Council resolution . 
`` We believe that U.N. Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 , read together , neither specified nor precluded providing defense materiel to the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . 
`` We would respectfully disagree with the Russian assessment , '' he added . 
Nevertheless , although legal , arming the rebels was `` not an option that we have acted on , '' he said . 
Although Russia is not involved in the bombing campaign , its stance could add to reservations among some NATO countries wary over an air war that has lasted longer and cost more than expected . 
Moscow could also challenge Paris at the U.N. Security Council , where both are veto-wielding permanent members . 
U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said it was up to the Security Council to determine what is permitted by its resolutions . 
France 's weapons airlift , while possibly increasing the insurgent threat to Gaddafi , highlights a dilemma for NATO . 
More than 90 days into its bombing campaign , Gaddafi is still in power and no breakthrough is in sight , making some NATO members feel they should help the rebels more actively , something the poorly-armed insurgents have encouraged . 
But if they do that , they risk fracturing the international coalition over how far to go . 
The World Bank 's Libya representative said on Thursday Islamist militants could gain ground if the conflict wears on . 
`` If this civil war goes on , it would be a new Somalia , which I do n't say lightly , '' said Marouane Abassi , World Bank country manager for Libya who has been in Tunisia since February . 
`` In three months we could be dealing with extremists . 
That 's why time is very important in this conflict , before we face problems in managing it . '' 
Even before news of the French arms supply emerged , fissures were emerging in the coalition with some members voicing frustration about the high cost , civilian casualties , and the elusiveness of a military victory . 
Gaddafi says the NATO campaign is an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing the North African state 's oil . 
He says NATO 's U.N.-mandated justification for its campaign -- to protect Libyan civilians from attack -- is spurious . 
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen made clear on Thursday the weapons airlift was a unilateral French initiative . 
Asked by reporters on a visit to Vienna if NATO had been involved , he answered : `` No. '' `` As regards compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolution , it is for the U.N. sanctions committee to determine that , '' Rasmussen said . 
The rebel advance toward Tripoli 's southwest outskirts from the Western Mountains has not been matched by progress toward the capital from the east , where they hold Misrata on the coast about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- from the capital . 
The city has been bombarded for months by Gaddafi 's forces . 
Six rockets landed early on Thursday near the oil refinery and port . 
A Reuters journalist there reported no casualties . 
Britain 's military said its Apache helicopters had attacked a government checkpoint and two military vehicles near Khoms , on the Mediterranean coast between Misrata and Tripoli . 
Insurgents say Gaddafi 's forces are massing and bringing weapons to quell an uprising in Zlitan , the next big town along the road from Misrata to the capital . 
Rebels inside Zlitan said they mounted a raid on pro-Gaddafi positions on Wednesday night . '' 
-LRB- We -RRB- carried out a violent attack last night on checkpoints ... and exchanged gunfire , killing a number of soldiers , '' a rebel spokesman , who identified himself as Mabrouk , told Reuters from the town . 
Le Figaro newspaper said France had parachuted rocket launchers , assault rifles and anti-tank missiles into the Western Mountains in early June . 
A French military spokesman later confirmed arms had been delivered , although he said anti-tank missiles were not among them . 
Despite the diplomatic storm , the rebels encouraged more arms deliveries . 
`` Giving -LRB- us -RRB- weapons we will be able to decide the battle more quickly , so that we can shed as little blood as possible , '' senior rebel figure Mahmoud Jibril said in Vienna . 
The conflict has halted oil exports from Libya , helping push up world oil prices . 
Jibril said it may take years for oil exports to fully resume : `` No , no oil is being sold . 
A lot of the oil well system was destroyed , especially in the east . '' 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Al Quaeda finding a way to get to those weapons ? 
Is it even relevant ? 
Do you really think Al Quaeda does n't already have heaps of ways and connection to get weapons ? 
Plus do n't forget that Gaddafi is a crazy psychopath , what do you think will happen when he feels his end coming ? 
Do his best to piss the allied force off . 
by simply giving away weapons to Al Quaeda and other extremist organization because he knows they will eventually use them against the people who helped forcing him out . 
My point is that it is time to do whatever is needed to kick Gadaffi out , and also maybe stop insinuating that the rebels will give the weapons away to Al Qaeda . 
Get out of Libya , we have no business there . 
This is a trumped up war . 
If we 're so worried about civilian deaths , why are n't we addressing the slaughters that have taken place in gaza ? 
THe IDF has been killing them routinely , where is NATO on this ? 
Nato just send in a heat team like the united states did with osama bin laden . 
Because let 's face it that 's really what you want to do . 
Stop trying to cover it up with politics or with the guise of we are trying to support the people of libya . 
You want qaddafi out . 
Just do it ... This discussion is now closed .

2011-07-01,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan rebel fighters flash the victory sign as they drive on June 11 , 2011 in Ajdabiya , south west of Benghazi . 
NEW : Libyan state TV reports strikes by NATO forces in Gharyan , south of Tripoli Rebel leaders in Misrata say they are in talks with France about supplying arms France has not confirmed that claim , but says it has dropped weapons to rebels elsewhere Libya 's leader Moammar Gadhafi is under huge international pressure to step down Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The French government is in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition , a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said late Thursday . 
The French government has not confirmed the claim , which follows an acknowledgement earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere . 
Ibrahim Baitalmal , the spokesman for Misrata 's Military Council , said that if the French agreed to help in Misrata , anti-Gadhafi forces there would receive much needed supplies to fight against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces . 
Misrata is surrounded on three sides by Gadhafi 's forces , which are much better armed . 
The city 's only outlet is by sea . 
Gadhafi has been under enormous international pressure to step down following a months-long uprising by rebels , emboldened by popular movements across the Middle East , trying to bring an end to his 42-year rule . 
The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . 
NATO began bombing military targets a short time later . 
Libyan state TV reported Friday that NATO had attacked targets in the city of Gharyan , south of the capital , Tripoli . 
It also reported that pro-Gadhafi forces had bombed an opposition building in Tobruk , in the far east of the country . 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded an explanation from Paris Thursday over its parachuting-in of arms to Libyan rebels -- which was first revealed in a French media report Wednesday -- Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported . 
Lavrov said that if confirmed , France 's action was in violation of the U.N. resolution . 
But speaking in Moscow Friday , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said his country 's NATO partners and the U.N. Security Council had been told about France 's decision to drop weapons for the Libyan opposition . 
`` We are exactly within the framework of resolutions 1970 and 1973 ... all means can be used to help civilian populations to protect themselves , '' he said . 
`` It 's within that framework that we reacted . 
We informed our NATO partners and the Security Council . '' 
French Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Thierry Burkhard confirmed Wednesday that its military had dropped food , medical products and light weaponry by parachute to Libyans in Djebel Nefoussa . 
`` It became clear that people there were defenseless and very much threatened by Gadhafi 's forces , '' he said . 
`` The weapons were given for self defense because of the security situation . '' 
Speaking at a news conference Thursday , Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi said rebel forces were receiving arms from France but were not trained in their use . 
He said it was reckless of France to take such action , saying it went `` against all of the proclaimed aims of NATO 's intervention in Libya . '' 
CNN 's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report .

2011-07-01,"By the CNN Wire Staff Daughter : Gadhafi is ` symbol , guide ' Ayesha Gadhafi is the Libyan leader 's only daughter She says the uprising and NATO campaign have brought her family together `` Contrary to what has been said , our family is still very tight , '' she says Gadhafi 's daughter says her father will not step down -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The only daughter of Moammar Gadhafi is standing behind her father , saying he will not step down because he is `` a symbol , a guide '' for the Libyan people . 
`` This is his country , his land , his people . 
Where would he go ? 
, '' Ayesha Gadhafi , 34 , told CNN affiliate France 2 during an interview at her home in Tripoli . 
`` There is one thing that you do n't understand and that you will never understand . 
It is that my father is a symbol , a guide . '' 
The comments by Gadhafi 's daughter come as NATO 's bombing campaign crossed the 100-day mark , raising concerns among some that the airstrikes could drag on for months . 
Gadhafi has been under enormous international pressure to step down following a months-long uprising by rebels , emboldened by popular movements across the Middle East , trying to bring an end to his 42-year rule . 
The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . 
NATO began bombing military targets a short time later . 
Gadhafi 's daughter has accused NATO of war crimes for airstrikes targeting her father in Tripoli that resulted in the deaths of her four-month-old daughter , her brother and his two children . 
`` I am not hiding . 
I am at home . 
I live normally , '' she said in the France 2 interview that aired Thursday . 
`` But you see , I 've already lost one of my children and my brother in the bombings . 
Every day there are members of my people who die . 
Anyone who has a heart can understand what I feel . '' 
Gadhafi 's daughter has been a staunch defender of her father and a familiar sight on Libyan State TV . 
She is believed to have had a hand in keeping the peace among her seven brothers , who have vied over the years for positions of prominence at their father 's side . 
`` Contrary to what has been said , our family is still very tight . 
These events have brought us closer than ever . 
There is no division , no difference between us , '' she said . 
`` What is being said about it is pure invention . '' 
Ayesha Gadhafi , who studied in France , admonished the French for their participation in the NATO campaign . 
`` Never would I imagine this country would one day kill my brother and my family , '' she told France 2 . 
`` Through you , I want to send a message to the wives of the French pilots who bomb us . 
` Your husbands are not working to defend civilians in Libya , '' ' she said . 
`` They kill my people and our children and for what ? 
To satisfy , -LRB- French President Nicolas -RRB- Sarkozy , who thinks that the more Libyans he kills , the more votes he gets during elections . '' 
She has been described as a longtime , loud supporter of anti-government groups , standing up for the IRA and Iraqi insurgents . 
She even joined Saddam Hussein 's defense team prior to his being sentenced to death by hanging in Iraq . 
When The Telegraph , a London-based newspaper , asked her how she felt about Iraqis who say Hussein slaughtered people , she said : `` You are bound to meet people who may be against your policies . ''

2011-07-01,"A munitions bunker belonging to Gaddafi 's troops that was destroyed by NATO several days ago is seen approximately 40 kms -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- southeast of Zintan June 29 , 2011 . 
NEAR BIR AL-GHANAM , Libya | Fri Jul 1 , 2011 12:49 am BST NEAR BIR AL-GHANAM , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels gathered on a ridge overlooking a strategic town only 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- from Tripoli on Thursday , preparing for a battle that could allow them to march directly to the seat of Muammar Gaddafi 's power . 
About 50 rebel fighters spent Thursday at an observation post 2 km outside the town of Bir al-Ghanam , using binoculars to try to assess the position of Gaddafi 's forces . 
They reached the area on Sunday after fighting in the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli , an area where France said this week it had air-dropped arms , provoking a diplomatic storm among world powers . 
A French military spokesman confirmed on Thursday a report in Le Figaro that rocket launchers and assault rifles were among arms parachuted in , prompting an angry reaction from Russia , one of many countries who have kept doors open to Gaddafi . 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said supplying arms was a `` crude violation '' of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970 , which imposed a comprehensive arms embargo in February . 
Gaddafi 's forces in Bir al-Ghanam know the rebels are watching them from the ridge . 
At one point on Thursday they fired mortars and artillery , sending people running for cover . 
The town is just an hour 's drive from Aziziyah on Tripoli 's southern outskirts , and a similar distance from Zawiyah , which controls the coastal highway that links Tripoli to the Tunisian border and the outside world . 
A trickle of fighters from around the region joined them throughout the day . 
Some came from Zintan , in the mountains behind them , while others said they had made their way clandestinely from Zawiyah , where Gaddafi 's forces have put down two revolts since February . 
The rebels encouraged more arms deliveries . 
`` Giving -LRB- us -RRB- weapons we will be able to decide the battle more quickly , so that we can shed as little blood as possible , '' senior rebel figure Mahmoud Jibril said in Vienna . 
The rebels advance in the west contrasts with little progress east of Tripoli , increasing frustration among NATO allies over a three-month-old air campaign to back the rebels that has exceeded costs and time-frames originally envisaged . 
France , Britain and the United States say the air campaign will not end until Gaddafi falls . 
The war has become the bloodiest of the `` Arab Spring '' uprisings sweeping North Africa and the Middle East . 
Paris says it has not violated the U.N. embargo because the weapons it gave the rebels were needed to protect civilians from an imminent attack , which a later resolution seems to endorse .

`` We would respectfully disagree with the Russian assessment , '' he added . 
Nevertheless , the United States had not taken steps to arm the rebels , he said . 
Rebels acknowledged French support , saying it had helped sustain them in the region . 
`` There should be no doubt that Libyans in the Nafusa Mountain -LRB- Western Mountains -RRB- area are alive and safe today thanks to a combination of heroic Libyan bravery and French wisdom and support , '' Vice Chairman Abdul Hafeedh Ghoga of the Transitional National Council said in a statement .

Gaddafi 's daughter Aisha told French 2 television the government was involved in talks with the rebels . 
`` There are direct and indirect negotiations and we should stop letting Libyan blood , '' she said in an interview aired on Thursday . 
`` And for that we are ready to ally with the devil and that is the armed rebels . ''

NEW : The African Union calls for talks between rebels and the government A government spokesman reiterated Gadhafi 's call for vengeance 11 rebels wounded in exchange of fire at frontline The rebel-held city of Misrata and the embattled city of Dafniya were attacked Saturday Dafniya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan rebels and troops loyal to Moammar Gadhafi shelled each other for hours on Saturday in clashes at the highly contested frontline of Dafniya , an embattled town just west of the besieged port city of Misrata . 
At least 11 rebels were wounded in the exchange of fire and treated at one of the two field hospitals in what has been the most active day in Dafniya this week , according to a CNN team . 
Heavy government shelling on Misrata and Dafniya began shortly after Gadhafi rallied his supporters in an audio message on state TV and threatened to take the fighting to Europe in retaliation for NATO 's bombing campaign . 
`` As soon as Gadhafi 's speech ended , they started shelling Dafniya and around midnight there was a salvo of about eight rockets inside Misrata itself , and it continues on the front this morning , '' said CNN 's Ben Wedeman , who was in Misrata Saturday . 
Daughter : Gadhafi is ` symbol , guide ' Scrambling for cash in Misrata Gadhafi has vowed vengeance for NATO bombings in Libya . 
He said the Libyan military could be `` like locusts , like bees '' in Europe , potentially targeting homes and offices . 
`` You are mistaken , you are involved in a battle that you do n't know what you are going to face , so withdraw and run away , '' Gadhafi told a pro-government gathering in Tripoli . 
`` Our people is able in one day to move the battle to the Mediterranean , and able to move the battle to Europe . '' 
Gadhafi referred to NATO , which began bombing military targets in Libya after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- to protect civilians . 
Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim on Saturday reiterated Gadhafi 's call for vengeance . 
NATO 's `` aggression is killing our children -LRB- and -RRB- Europe will have to face the consequences , '' he said . 
`` You will have people attacking Europe , joining terrorist organizations against Europe , and building a culture that makes legitimate all violence against Europe . '' 
Ibrahim claimed rebel fighters `` have no popular support . '' 
`` The rebels have no future , '' he added . 
`` They know it and they are terrified . '' 
On Saturday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO mission in Libya is on track , with pressure on Gadhafi mounting and the rebel forces growing stronger . 
`` We need to see this through , and we are in complete agreement that we will , '' she said alongside the Spanish foreign minister in Madrid Saturday . 
In Washington , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was taking seriously the Libyan leader 's remarks . 
`` Certainly this is an individual who 's obviously capable of carrying out these kinds of threats , '' he told reporters . 
`` It 's what makes him so dangerous . 
But he 's also someone who 's given to overblown rhetoric . '' 
He said the United States would continue to support NATO 's mission of increasing pressure on Gadhafi to step aside . 
The events came one day after the African Union 's special committee on Libya said it had officially presented a plan meant to help Libya find a way out of the current crisis . 
The proposal states that Gadhafi will not be part of the negotiation process , but stops short of saying he should step down . 
`` It is envisaged to convene , soon , in Addis Ababa , -LRB- Ethiopia -RRB- negotiations between the parties to discuss these proposals , '' the group said in a statement . 
Committee members have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders over the past three months . 
Another African Union-led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in April . 
The French government was in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition , a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said Thursday . 
The French government has not confirmed the claim , which follows an acknowledgment earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere .

2011-07-02,"TUNIS | Sat Jul 2 , 2011 5:40 am EDT TUNIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A protracted struggle for Libya could leave it in the hands of extremists instead of the liberal economic technocrats who now lead its rebel movement , the World Bank 's representative for Libya said on Thursday . 
`` If this civil war goes on , it would be a new Somalia , which I do n't say lightly , '' said Marouane Abassi , World Bank country manager for Libya who has been in Tunisia since February . 
`` In three months we could be dealing with extremists . 
That 's why time is very important in this conflict , before we face problems in managing it . '' 
Abassi , who is Tunisian , said the World Bank had been working with Libya since 2006 on plans for economic reforms led by leader Muammar Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam , although many of those reform plans were scuppered by Gaddafi . 
He described some of the leaders of the rebel Transitional National Council as among those most strongly associated with economic reform plans . '' 
... We know them , we did good work with them , '' Abassi said , citing Ali Issawi , a former economy minister and ambassador , and Mahmoud Jebril , who resigned from a state economic think-tank after Gaddafi overruled his suggestions for liberalising the economy . 
`` These guys tried inside -LRB- Gaddafi 's government -RRB- . 
In 2009 Gaddafi stopped the connection between us and them , '' said Abassi . 
Nevertheless , parts of Gaddafi 's government and local councils were still seeking World Bank advice up to February , when pro-democracy protests broke out , he said . 
`` In the last two years it was a battle between reformists and the old guard . 
But even the last minister of economy who was against us ... accepted the rules of the game , '' he said . 
The rebellion , which began with an uprising in February and has been backed by Western air strikes since March , has so far failed to dislodge Gaddafi , raising pressure on Western countries to take more decisive action . 
France said on Wednesday it had sent arms to the rebels , which some countries believe violates an arms embargo . 
Gaddafi says the Western intervention is a plot to steal Libya 's oil . 
Abassi said he left the World Bank 's Tripoli office on February 20 after government forces began suppressing protesters . 
`` Now we are trying to understand how we can help Libya after the conflict , '' he said . 
Tunisia , where he is now based , is also suffering financially , losing some $ 200 million a month in remittances and other revenue from Tunisian expatriates who have returned . 
`` Over 65,000 Tunisians have returned out of 125,000 who were living in Libya . 
They are like refugees in Tunisia without revenue . 
Tunisia gave them some cash handouts and we are trying to provide funds and grants , '' Abassi said . 
`` Over 1.7 million Libyans come each year to Tunisia and for the Tunisian economy it 's very important . 
They spend a lot of money on health -- maybe 50 percent of the revenue in clinics in the south is from Libyans , '' Abassi said .

2011-07-04,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi has made clear he would not recognize the International Criminal Court 's authority . 
NEW : Libya 's deputy foreign minister says talks are continuing Report : Rebel leader says Moammar Gadhafi can stay , if he resigns Gadhafi would have to remain under supervision , rebel leader says New reports emerge of fighting in Libya 's western mountains -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's rebel leader says he does not have a problem with Moammar Gadhafi remaining in the country , once he resigns and as long as he remains under supervision , according to a television report . 
Mustafa Abdel Jalil contradicted earlier opposition statements that Gadhafi 's exit from the country was an absolute prerequisite to bring about the end of the months-long conflict . 
It signaled a possible willingness to negotiate with the Libyan leader to bring about an end to the fighting . 
In a Reuters Television report Sunday , Jalil made the comments while reacting to a proposal put forward by the African Union , which rebels have interpreted to mean Gadhafi should have no further role in the country 's leadership . 
Jalil told Reuters once Gadhafi resigns , `` At that point he can decide if he would stay in Libya or abroad . '' 
`` If he desires to stay in Libya , we will be the ones to determine the place and there will be international supervision on all his movements and communications , '' he said during an interview in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
Daughter : Gadhafi is ` symbol , guide ' Donilon : No decision on arming Libya Jalil took the reins of the rebel movements after resigning from Gadhafi 's government in February over what he saw as excessive use of force against demonstrators calling for the leader 's resignation . 
Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim has previously said the prospect of a peace deal would be welcomed , but not one that rested on Gadhafi 's departure . 
Libya 's Deputy Foreign Minister , Khaled Kaim , noted Monday that talks between government officials and rebel leaders are continuing on multiple levels , including daily phone conversations . 
He expressed optimism that the talks could have a positive outcome if NATO 's air campaign is halted . 
Kaim said Italian officials had granted travel visas to certain individuals to help facilitate the talks outside of Libya . 
But Maurizio Massari , a spokesman for the Italian foreign ministry , denied Kaim 's assertion . 
The fighting in Libya , meanwhile , was slated to take center stage Monday at a meeting between NATO nations and Russia . 
The meeting brought together countries who support the airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's forces and one of the biggest critics of the bombing campaign . 
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was scheduled to meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev as part of the Russia-NATO Council meeting in Russia 's Black Sea resort town of Sochi , Russia 's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported , citing the Kremlin . 
`` The sole possibility of stabilizing the situation in Libya is an immediate cease-fire and the start of talks between the internal Libyan participants in the conflict with the support of , but not interference from , outside , '' the Kremlin said , according to RIA Novosti . 
Russia has been a critic of the NATO bombing campaign that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution for the use of force , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . 
Russia , a member of the Security Council , abstained from the vote . 
`` Special responsibility in the search for a political-diplomatic solution to the crisis lies with regional organizations , above all the African Union , and the UN secretary general 's special envoy , '' the Kremlin said , according to the news report . 
The meeting followed reports Sunday of fierce fighting in western Libya , where Gadhafi 's forces have been shelling the towns of Yefren and Kikla , east of the rebel stronghold of Zintan . 
The shelling began three days ago , according to Mazigh Buzakhar , who works for an opposition media group . 
Buzakhar said clashes in the western Nafusa mountains on Sunday killed two rebel fighters and wounded 11 . 
CNN can not independently confirm Buzakhar 's account . 
Conditions in the embattled towns in the Nafusa mountains are bleak , with no electricity and a shortage of water , Buzakhar said . 
Rebels have been battling Gadhafi 's forces for months in an attempt to bring about an end to the Libyan leader 's 42-year rule . 
The rebels received a financial boost Sunday when Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu pledged $ 200 million in support to the opposition . 
Davutoglu made the pledge during a meeting with Jalil in Benghazi , the foreign ministry said . 
The Foreign Ministry told CNN Monday that Turkey recognizes the opposition in Libya as legitimate representatives of the country , however , it does not mean the rebels are recognized as the sole representatives . 
Turkey has not cut off its diplomatic relations with Gadhafi 's government , the ministry said . 
Gadhafi has been under international pressure to step down , and the International Criminal Court at The Hague issued a warrant for his arrest as well as for the arrest of his son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi . 
The warrants are `` for crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution , `` allegedly committed across Libya '' from February 15 through `` at least '' February 28 , the court said in a statement . 
On Sunday , South African President Jacob Zuma traveled to Russia to discuss efforts to end the fighting in Libya , just days after he and other members of the African Union said they would not cooperate with the International Criminal Court 's arrest warrant for Moammar Gadhafi . 
Zuma and others were attending a meeting of the International Contact Group on Libya -- a group of NATO countries , Arab nations and other countries working to bring about an end to the months-long conflict . 
The African Union said its members will not cooperate with the ICC 's arrest warrant for Gadhafi , arguing that the measure jeopardizes efforts to negotiate a peace deal in the war-torn nation . 
The arrest warrant `` seriously complicates the efforts aimed at finding a negotiated political solution to the crisis in Libya , '' said a statement summarizing the countries ' decision at a summit in Equatorial Guinea that ended Friday . 
Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute , which established the international court 's authority , and the court does not have the power to enter Libya and arrest the leaders . 
Gadhafi has made clear he would not recognize the court 's authority .

The arrest warrant `` seriously complicates the efforts aimed at finding a negotiated political solution to the crisis in Libya , '' said a statement summarizing the countries ' decision at a summit in Equatorial Guinea that ended Friday . 
A three-judge panel at court in the Hague in the Netherlands issued arrest warrants June 27 for Gadhafi , his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi . 
The warrants are `` for crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution , `` allegedly committed across Libya '' from February 15 through `` at least '' February 28 , the court said in a statement . 
The court 's judges said the arrests were necessary `` to ensure their appearances before the court , '' ensure that the three `` do not continue to obstruct and endanger the court 's investigations '' and `` prevent them from using their powers to continue the commission of crimes . '' 
Daughter : Gadhafi is ` symbol , guide ' Donilon : No decision on arming Libya Gadhafi has made clear he would not recognize the court 's authority . 
Some analysts said last week that the court 's move could damage efforts to get Gadhafi to end his 42-year reign , stopping him from leaving the country for fear of being prosecuted . 
`` In effect , the ICC arrest warrant tells Gadhafi to fight to the death , '' said Michael Rubin , an analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute . 
Speaking to reporters after the court issued the warrants last week , chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo batted away questions from reporters about whether an ICC arrest warrant would discourage Gadhafi from stepping down . 
He said the decision to investigate Gadhafi came from a unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution , not the court . 
The U.N. Security Council referred the matter to the ICC through a resolution February 26 , following widespread complaints about Gadhafi 's efforts to crush a rebellion . 
In a statement Sunday , a spokesman for the British Foreign Office called on Gadhafi to end violence and leave office , noting that the NATO coalition 's aim was to protect civilians , not arrange a safe exit for the Libyan leader . 
`` We have been clear that those responsible should be held to account . 
The ultimate political objective is to facilitate a transition to a stable , democratic Libya , '' the spokesman said in a statement . 
`` To achieve this , Gadhafi must step down , and leave Libya to the Libyan people . ''

Nabil Al-Araby gives first interview since taking over as Arab League chief The alliance 's representatives tapped him to replace Amre Moussa in May He tells an Egyptian state-run media outlet Syria should implement reforms He says he 'll order an investigation into alleged human rights abuses in Libya In his first comments since taking over as the alliance 's secretary-general , Al-Araby acknowledged that the region 's political landscape has changed significantly in recent months . 
He touched on a number of hot-button subjects in his interview with the state-run Al-Ahram news agency , including the hostilities in Libya and strife in Syria . 
Now that he is the Arab League 's secretary-general , Al-Araby , 75 , said he plans to order investigations into alleged human rights abuses perpetrated by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
He also urged Syrian authorities to implement real reforms and transition to democracy . 
The former Egyptian foreign minister also weighed in on the plight of Palestinians , saying an independent Palestinian nation ought to be recognized and Israelis should pull out of Palestinian territory . 
Al-Araby was elected by Arab League representatives in May , after its then-leader Amre Moussa declared his intention to leave the post in order to run for president of Egypt . 
That country is in the midst of a major political transition following the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak in February . 
A judge on the International Court of Justice between 2001 and 2006 , Al-Araby joined the movement to unseat Mubarak 's government early this year . 
He was one of six ministers sworn in last March by the head of Egypt 's military , Mohammed Hussein Tantawi , to join the administration headed by Prime Minister Essam Sharaf . 
He replaced Ahmed Aboul Gheit , who had been foreign minister since 2004 . 
Well before that , Al-Araby had established himself as a force in Egyptian as well as international politics . 
That includes several roles related to the United Nations , including as Egypt 's representative in New York between 1991 and 1999 , as well as a stint as the North African country 's ambassador to India , according to the official Egyptian State Information Service . 
He has spoken to many groups over the years , including at the American Society of International Law , International Peace Institute , the Hague Academy of International Law , Columbia University and Duke University .

14 rebels die in Misrata fighting Rebels capture Al-Qawalish , according to a rebel fighter The town is about 30 miles southwest of Tripoli Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rebels marched toward Tripoli Wednesday , capturing a town southwest of the capital from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces , a rebel fighter told CNN . 
Fighting also engulfed Misrata , east of Tripoli , where 14 rebels were killed and 42 others wounded , according to Mohamed Ibrahim , a rebel spokesman in the city . 
Three civilians also died in rocket attacks launched by Gadhafi 's men , Ibrahim said . 
CNN could not verify the information . 
Just west of Misrata , in Dafniya , 14 rebel fighters were killed and 42 were wounded Wednesday during a firefight with Gadhafi forces , said Ibrahim . 
Clinton : Gadhafi should step down Daughter : Gadhafi is ` symbol , guide ' Donilon : No decision on arming Libya The rebels ran over Al-Qawalish , a town of about 4,000 residents 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- southwest of Tripoli , a stronghold for Gadhafi since the start of the uprising in February . 
Their attacks got under way around 7 a.m. from the north , the west and the south . 
On the western front , journalist David Adams said rebels were using Grad launchers , two Russian tanks and a number of other vehicles , rockets and guns . 
The rebels captured the town around 2:30 p.m. , entering from all three fronts , some having captured vehicles belonging to Gadhafi forces . 
Some rebel fighters could be seen breaking windows , shooting doors of houses and rummaging through families ' belongings . 
Some said they were looking for weapons , but they appeared to be looting . 
After they had lost control of the town , Gadhafi forces began shelling its periphery with Grad rockets . 
At least 12 government soldiers died , six were wounded and seven were captured , said Adams . 
Rebels , whose casualties included at least seven dead and 15 wounded , said their next target would be Al Assabiah , said Adams . 
Hassan Al-Jiwali , a rebel fighter from the Nafusa Mountains , said 50 of Gadhafi 's men were killed and 15 were captured in the offensive . 
Fighting has erupted in the western mountains in recent weeks as more than four months of battles have failed to yield a decisive victory for either side . 
The first United Nations joint mission to reach the devastated mountain region found many people in dire need of food . 
A World Food Programme statement said markets were not functioning due to limited fuel and cash , and basic services such as electricity and water were lacking in some areas . 
The rebels said they were moving northward , closer to the capital on the Mediterranean Sea . 
They intended to march to the city of Garyan , which sits on the main highway to Tripoli . 
Also Wednesday , NATO said its air forces targeted military re-fueling equipment in the Brega area southwest of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
`` These precision strikes will limit the ability of pro-Gadhafi forces to threaten Libyan civilians and significantly degrade logistical support for Gadhafi 's campaign in eastern Libya , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of Operation Unified Protector , in a news release . 
France has acknowledged arming the rebels , saying the weapons were for self-defense . 
However , French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said Tuesday the weapons were no longer necessary because the rebels were becoming `` more autonomous . '' 
But debate continued over France 's decisions . 
In a contentious closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday , Russia argued that , by sending weapons , France had violated the council 's resolution that authorized the use of NATO force in Libya .

Security Council meeting Tuesday , Russia criticized France 's decision to airlift weapons to rebel forces in Libya , according to a Western diplomat present during the discussions . 
Earlier Tuesday , French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet told reporters that parachute drops of weapons into the North African nation were `` no longer necessary '' because opposition forces had become organized enough to procure their own arms . 
Rebels battling Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are `` becoming more autonomous , '' Longuet said . 
`` This autonomy allows them to build relationships with external partners , including when it comes to equipping themselves in self-defense , '' he said . 
Clinton : Gadhafi should step down But even as Longuet said the weapons drops were no longer needed , debate over the approach continued . 
Russia brought up the issue at the U.N. Security Council session Tuesday , arguing that by sending weapons , France had violated the council 's resolution that authorized NATO force in Libya , the Western diplomat said . 
France offered a detailed defense of the country 's actions , arguing that supplying weapons was `` the only practical way of fulfilling '' the council 's mandate authorizing force to take `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians , the diplomat said . 
During Tuesday 's meeting , ambassadors from the United Kingdom and United States defended France 's actions , according to the Western diplomat . 
France acknowledged last Wednesday that it had supplied weapons to anti-Gadhafi forces , saying the weapons were provided for self-defense . 
`` It became clear that people there were defenseless and very much threatened by Gadhafi 's forces , '' French Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Thierry Burkhard said last Wednesday . 
Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi told reporters last week that rebel forces were receiving arms from France but were not trained in their use . 
He said it was reckless of France to take such action , saying it went `` against all of the proclaimed aims of NATO 's intervention in Libya . '' 
Meanwhile , in Libya , a rebel spokesman said fighting had moved Tuesday westward from Misrata , which rebel forces say they continue to hold . 
Eleven rebels were killed in Dafniya , and one was killed in Zliten , said Mohammed Ibrahim , the spokesman . 
Another 60 rebels were wounded in the two cities , he said , citing figures from Al-Hekma Hospital , in Misrata . 
Pro-Gadhafi forces fired some six rockets into Misrata , but they caused no casualties , he said . 
The opposition website freemisurata.com , published by Ibrahim 's group , said at least 20 members of Gadhafi 's forces were killed and six were captured Tuesday in Dafniya and Zliten .

2011-07-07,"TRIPOLI | Thu Jul 7 , 2011 6:31 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said on Thursday he was against NATO intervention in Libya but had to go along with it , an admission that exposed the fragility of the alliance trying to unseat Muammar Gaddafi . 
NATO warplanes have been bombing Libya under a U.N. mandate , but the alliance is under mounting strain because of the cost of the operation and the failure , after more than three months , to produce a decisive outcome . 
`` I was against this measure , '' Berlusconi said . 
`` I had my hands tied by the vote of the parliament of my country . 
But I was against and I am against this intervention which will end in a way that no-one knows . '' 
Some of the alliance bombing missions over Libya take off from military airbases in Italy . 
There was no suggestion following Berlusconi 's comments that Rome would withdraw the use of the bases . 
But Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa said that the cost to Italy of the Libya operation would fall from 142 million euros in the first half of the year to less than 60 million euros in the second half as part of general defense spending cuts . 
He said after a cabinet meeting on Thursday the aircraft carrier Garibaldi with three aircraft on board had been withdrawn , and their tasks would be taken on by land-based aircraft . 
The comments from Rome came just a day after Libyan rebels made a big push toward Tripoli on two fronts . 
Speaking at a book presentation in Rome , Berlusconi said : `` I went to Paris and I said -- I can repeat this -- I would have stood with Mrs Merkel as far as this decision to intervene in the no fly zone is concerned . '' 
He appeared to be referring to a March 19 meeting at which several Western powers decided to launch the military intervention . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel chose not to involve her country in the operation . 
`` We posed very precise questions to the protagonists of this initiative -- that 's to say President Sarkozy and Prime Minister David Cameron -- in the most recent meeting of the heads of government in Brussels , '' he said . 
`` The answer was that the war will end when there is , as we expect , a revolt by the population of Tripoli against the current regime . '' 
A move to stop funding for President Barack Obama 's military intervention in Libya was narrowly defeated in the U.S. House of Representatives . 
Both political parties split over the measure , highlighting how tensions over U.S. involvement in Libya 's civil war have crossed party lines and created unusual alliances . 
Republicans and Democrats argued that President Obama violated the U.S. Constitution and the 1973 War Powers Resolution by failing to secure congressional authorization for U.S. military operations in the north African country . 
Gaddafi has rejected any suggestion that he will give up power and he has described the NATO campaign as an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing Libya 's oil . 
Potentially adding to the pressure on Italy to review its stance on Libya , a senior Libyan government spokesman said negotiations had begun with Russian and Chinese firms to take over the role of Italian energy firm ENI in oil and gas projects . 
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged Gaddafi -- who has dismissed rebels trying to end his four-decade rule as criminals and vermin -- to listen to the will of the people . 
`` We are far from reaching an agreement to reach an end to the conflict but the negotiating process is ongoing , '' Ban told reporters in Geneva . 
`` He -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- has to listen much more attentively and seriously what would be the best for the future of the Libyan people . '' 
Rebel fighters trying to advance toward the capital Tripoli launched offensives on two fronts on Wednesday and made significant gains . 
But analysts said the advances were not yet enough to shift the military balance against Gaddafi . 
In the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli , fighters pushed pro-Gaddafi forces out of the village of al-Qawalish , clearing the way for them to try to seize control of the main highway heading north to the capital . 
Colonel Juma Ibrahim , a rebel commander in the nearby town of Zintan , said seven rebel fighters were killed in the operation and 30 wounded . 
He said the capture of al-Qawalish meant other villages and towns in the region were no longer in the range of government rockets and artillery . 
`` It will let the people return to their houses , '' he said . 
The slow push toward the capital would continue , he said . 
`` All fronts are quiet . 
Each side is making preparations for the next round . 
This is the quiet before the storm . '' 
A rebel spokesman in Nalut by the border with Tunisia said a rebel tank hit and destroyed a loyalist car carrying weapons north of the rebel-held town . 
Further north , on Libya 's Mediterranean coast , rebel fighters on Wednesday advanced west from Misrata to within about 13 km of Zlitan -- one of a chain of government-controlled towns blocking their advance to Tripoli . 
A Reuters reporter near the front line on Thursday said there was now a lull in the fighting , although he could hear a few explosions . 
Rebels at the front will need more ammunition , a minister with the National Transitional Council said while on a visit to Misrata . 
`` There is enough to run the front for the time being but we need more , '' Minister of Health Nagi Barakah said at a news conference . 
Gaddafi 's military capabilities have been severely hurt by the bombing , NATO military spokesman Mike Bracken said . 
NATO had `` degraded Gaddafi 's military capacity to the point that he is no longer capable of running any major military operation , '' he said . 
There were also signs Gaddafi may try to turn Friday prayers in Tripoli into a pro-government demonstration . 
Libyan TV broadcast calls from tribal leaders urging people in the capital to gather at the city 's Green Square for prayers . 
A post on a Facebook page used by anti-Gaddafi activists said it was possible the authorities would close mosques in the capital to force people to gather in the square . 
However , anti-Gaddafi rebels received a fresh diplomatic boost when China sent a senior diplomat to meet the rebel leadership in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . 
The visit by Chen Xiaodong , China 's foreign ministry chief for North African affairs , was the second official meeting between China and Libyan opposition leaders in less than a month . 
`` China believes that the present situation can not go on and a political resolution to find a way out of the Libyan crisis must be found as soon as possible , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular news briefing in Beijing . 
There were reports this week that Gaddafi -- under pressure from the five-month-old uprising against his rule , sanctions and the NATO bombing campaign -- was seeking a deal under which he would step down . 
His government has denied any such negotiations are underway , and NATO 's chief said he had no confirmation that Gaddafi was looking for a deal to relinquish power . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
He may have been against the invasion , as I think Italy probably was , but Berlusconi is little more than a rich businessman with a loud mouth . 
Berlusconi is feeling the pressure from ENI , not China , on the non-advancement of the situation in Libya . 
But his biggest problem is his coalition 's partner in Government who have given him a deadline to withdraw from the Libya intervention , given public opinion in Italy who was never favourable to this war . 
This discussion is now closed .

2011-07-07,"WASHINGTON | Thu Jul 7 , 2011 8:54 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A move to stop funding for President Barack Obama 's military intervention in Libya was narrowly defeated in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday , underscoring Congress ' unhappiness with the undeclared war . 
Both political parties split on the measure , highlighting how tensions over U.S. involvement -- in conjunction with NATO -- in Libya 's civil war have crossed party lines and created unusual alliances . 
Republicans and Democrats argued that President Obama violated the U.S. Constitution and the 1973 War Powers Resolution by failing to secure congressional authorization for U.S. military operations in the north African country . 
The House did vote , 225-201 , to bar any money in the defense spending bill from being spent on military equipment or training for Libyan rebels . 
The measure also would have to get Senate approval and be signed by Obama before becoming law . 
Representative Tom Cole , who sponsored the measure , called it a `` very important moment . '' 
`` It 's extraordinarily important that we stop the erosion of the war-making authority of the Congress of the United States , that we end this ill-advised adventure in Libya and that we reassert the rightful place of this institution in conducting war , authorizing it and funding it , '' he said . 
Senator John McCain , a fellow Republican , acknowledged frustration over Obama 's lack of consultation with Congress over the conflict but said the vote to bar funding for `` freedom fighters in Libya is deeply disturbing . '' 
`` This action sends the wrong message to both -LRB- Libyan leader Muammar -RRB- Gaddafi and those fighting for freedom and democracy in Libya -- especially with Gaddafi is clearly crumbling , '' McCain said . 
The House , in a 316-111 vote , also approved a measure barring the Pentagon from using funds from the 2012 defense spending bill on anything that violates the War Powers Resolution , which requires the president to seek congressional approval within 60 days of committing U.S. forces to a conflict . 
SPONSORED BY MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES On a vote of 199-229 , the House rejected the proposal to block defense funds in fiscal year 2012 , which begins October 1 , for U.S. military participation in the NATO-led mission against Gaddafi 's forces . 
The failed measure 's sponsors were Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich and Republican Representative Justin Amash . 
`` We are at war , '' Amash argued before the vote . 
`` The Constitution vests Congress with the exclusive power to declare war . '' 
He said it was embarrassing to hear the Obama administration 's `` flimsy '' arguments for being involved in Libya but it would be even more embarrassing if Congress did nothing about its constitutional role being ignored . 
`` We must stand up and say stop . '' 
But Representative Norm Dicks , a Democrat , said it would be wrong to undermine the president , as well as NATO allies involved in the war , by cutting off funds for it . 
He said the administration estimated the conflict would cost the United States a little more than $ 1 billion by September 30 . 
Representative Bill Young , a Republican , said there were no funds in the fiscal 2012 defense spending bill for Libya anyway , because the administration had said that it was taking the money from the `` base budget '' that had already been appropriated in the current fiscal year . 
The House has held several votes on the Libyan operation . 
Last month it defeated another move to curb the intervention , while also refusing to formally authorize the U.S. participation . 
The Senate has yet to take any votes on the war , although a resolution to authorize the U.S. role has passed a committee . 
The House actions reflect growing war fatigue among lawmakers after almost a decade of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq that have cost more than $ 1 trillion and have helped fuel a $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit . 
The United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission against Libya more than three months ago , aiming to prevent Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians in regions opposed to his rule . 
The mission now appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power .

Russia 's foreign minister says NATO is in a difficult situation , killing those it 's supposed to protect `` Libya has been bombed for more than three months now , and we see no end , '' Sergei Lavrov says Russia has been critical of France for arming the rebels Rebels claim they are advancing toward Tripoli Moscow -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There can be `` no fast solution '' to the NATO campaign in Libya , the Russian foreign minister said Thursday , arguing that civilians are dying on both sides of the conflict because of foreign intervention . 
NATO members trying to implement the United Nations mandate to protect civilians from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi `` are now in a difficult situation , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Russia state television . 
`` Libya has been bombed for more than three months now , and we see no end of this process , '' he said . 
Western statements that the campaign will continue until Gadhafi no longer poses a threat to Libyans are having a high cost in human lives , he said .

A plane departed for the capital Tripoli on Thursday , a day after one left for the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , the Emergency Situations Ministry said . 
Rebels claimed advances on Wednesday , saying they captured a town southwest of Tripoli . 
Fighting also engulfed Misrata , east of Tripoli , where 14 rebels were killed and 42 others wounded , according to Mohamed Ibrahim , a rebel spokesman in the city . 
Three civilians also died in rocket attacks launched by Gadhafi 's men , Ibrahim said . 
CNN could not verify the information . 
Just west of Misrata , in Dafniya , 14 rebel fighters were killed and 42 were wounded Wednesday during a firefight with Gadhafi forces , said Ibrahim . 
The rebels ran over Al-Qawalish , a town of about 4,000 residents 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- southwest of Tripoli , a stronghold for Gadhafi since the start of the uprising in February . 
Fighting has erupted in the western mountains in recent weeks as more than four months of battles have failed to yield a decisive victory for either side . 
The first United Nations joint mission to reach the devastated mountain region found many people in dire need of food . 
A World Food Programme statement said markets were not functioning due to limited fuel and cash , and basic services such as electricity and water were lacking in some areas . 
The rebels said they were moving northward , closer to the capital on the Mediterranean Sea . 
They intended to march to the city of Garyan , which sits on the main highway to Tripoli . 
Also Wednesday , NATO said its air forces targeted military re-fueling equipment in the Brega area southwest of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
`` These precision strikes will limit the ability of pro-Gadhafi forces to threaten Libyan civilians and significantly degrade logistical support for Gadhafi 's campaign in eastern Libya , '' Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of Operation Unified Protector , said in a news release . 
France has acknowledged arming the rebels , saying the weapons were for self-defense . 
However , French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said Tuesday the weapons were no longer necessary because the rebels were becoming `` more autonomous . '' 
But debate continued over France 's decisions . 
In a contentious closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday , Russia argued that by sending weapons , France had violated the council 's resolution that authorized the use of NATO force in Libya .

2011-07-10,"Rebels say they ousted Gadhafi 's forces from Qawalish several days ago The small village is 90 miles south of Tripoli The fighters appear spirited , flashing victory signs and posing for photos Aided by NATO strikes , they are hoping to unseat the longtime Libyan leader Qawalish , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Almost all civilians have fled the western Libya area around Qawalish , hoping to avoid the worst of the violence wracking the nation . 
Yet there is a buzz around this village , which is in the hands of rebel fighters eager to defeat forces loyal to longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
Their optimism and energy are matched , in many ways , by their inexperience . 
When spotters on a rooftop spy vehicles they believe belong to the Libyan army , a rebel rocket team wipes off desert grit from their weapon , oils it up and fires -- their aim , at best , approximate . 
The group 's commander , Fahti , knows the opposition forces are in many ways overmatched . 
`` They have tanks . 
Rockets , '' Fahti said . 
`` They have mortars , all the heavy weapons . '' 
Dressed in everything from military fatigues to polo shirts to T-shirts , the rebels are not the stereotypical picture of a modern fighting force . 
But despite their challenges , the rebels here have had success . 
That includes , they say , driving Libyan forces several days ago out of the village 45 kilometers -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , a key north-south route in the North African nation . 
One fighter said Gadhafi 's men are `` very afraid '' that rebels will soon take another big step forward by taking his home city of Gharyan , which is 45 kilometers to the north and just 100 kilometers south of the Libyan capital . 
While strongest in the east near Benghazi , the opposition remains active around much of Libya . 
A fighter named Mahmoud told CNN on Saturday that his comrades had conducted night raids and ambushes , for instance , around his native Zamiya , a coastal city still in the government 's hands about 50 kilometers from Tripoli . 
`` But on the coast Gadhafi is strong , he has his people everywhere , '' Mahmoud said . 
The opposition continues to get help in the form of NATO strikes . 
The alliance announced in a statement Saturday that it had struck a missile-firing position near Tawhurgha , south of Misrata , that it claims was tucked within a set of farm buildings . 
Libyan forces used this area to attack civilians in nearby Misrata through missile strikes and as a staging area for attacks , NATO said . 
In Qawalish , the rebels had some good fortune after coming upon an abandoned army base , and its boxes stacked almost to the ceiling with mortar and artillery rounds . 
The find was a welcome one for a force that , until recently , was struggling to muster the weaponry to keep up the fight . 
Those rolling through checkpoints around the village are almost exclusively rebel fighters , drawn to the battlefront by their commitment to a common cause . 
Their enthusiasm appears strong as they drive by , crammed into the back of pickup trucks , smiling broadly and flashing victory signs . 
And even with the sounds of war in the distance , some rebels pose for pictures -- victory photos , they hope , in their quest to end Gadhafi 's 42 years in power .

TRIPOLI | Sun Jul 10 , 2011 7:13 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A French minister said on Sunday it was time for Libya 's rebels to negotiate with Muammar Gaddafi 's government , but Washington said it stood firm in its belief that the Libyan leader can not stay in power . 
The diverging messages from two leading members of the Western coalition opposing Gaddafi hinted at the strain the alliance is under after more than three months of air strikes that have cost billions of dollars and failed to produce the swift outcome its backers had expected . 
French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet signaled growing impatience with the progress of the conflict when he said the rebels should negotiate now with Gaddafi 's government and not wait for his defeat . 
The rebels have so far refused to hold talks as long as Gaddafi is still in power , a stance which before now none of NATO 's major powers has publicly challenged . 
`` We have ... have asked them to speak to each other , '' Longuet , whose government has until now been among the most hawkish on Libya , said on French television station BFM TV . 
`` The position of the TNC -LRB- rebel Transitional National Council -RRB- is very far from other positions . 
Now , there will be a need to sit around a table , '' he said . '' 
Asked if it was possible to hold talks if Gaddafi had not stepped down , Longuet said : `` He will be in another room in his palace with another title . '' 
Soon after , the State Department in Washington issued a message that gave no hint of compromise . 
`` The Libyan people will be the ones to decide how this transition takes place , but we stand firm in our belief that Gaddafi can not remain in power , '' the department said in a written reply to a query . 
It also said the United States would continue efforts , as part of the NATO coalition , to protect civilians from attack and said it believed the alliance was helping ratchet up the pressure on Gaddafi . 
Gaddafi has been defiantly holding on to power in the face of rebel attacks trying to break his 41-year rule , NATO air strikes , economic sanctions and the defections of prominent members of his government . 
With no imminent end to the conflict in sight , cracks are emerging inside the NATO alliance . 
Some member states are balking at the burden on their recession-hit finances , and many are frustrated that there has been no decisive breakthrough . 
But even countries which support a political solution have not answered the question of how a deal can be hammered out when the rebels and their Western backers say Gaddafi must go while the Libyan leader himself says that is not up for negotiation . 
Strains over how to proceed in Libya are likely to surface on Friday when the contact group , which brings together the countries allied against Gaddafi , gathers in Istanbul for its next scheduled meeting . 
There was no immediate reaction to the French minister 's comments from the rebel leadership at its headquarters in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . 
On the ground , rebel forces trying to march on Tripoli have made modest gains in the past week , but the fighting on Sunday underlined it would a long slog . 
Gaddafi 's forces launched a heavy artillery bombardment to try to push back rebel fighters who last week seized the village of Al-Qawalish , 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli . 
Al-Qawalish is a strategic battleground because if the rebels manage to advance beyond it they will reach the main highway leading north into the capital Tripoli . 
A rebel fighter in the village , Amignas Shagruni , told Reuters that shells had been landing repeatedly over the past 24 hours from pro-Gaddafi forces positioned a few kilometres to the east . 
But he said : `` No one was hurt , thank God . '' 
During a 20-minute period while Reuters visited the frontline east of Al-Qawalish , at least five shells landed . 
However , they did not appear to be well targeted , striking random spots in the nearby hills . 
Libya has been convulsed by a civil war since February when thousands of people , inspired by revolutions in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia , rose up against his 41-year-rule . 
That rebellion has now turned into the bloodiest of the `` Arab Spring '' uprisings sweeping the region . 
Gaddafi sounded a new note of defiance on Friday . 
In an audio recording broadcast on state television , he threatened to export the war to Europe in revenge for the NATO-led military campaign against him . 
`` Hundreds of Libyans will martyr in Europe . 
I told you it is eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth , '' he said . 
`` You will regret it , NATO , when the war moves to Europe . '' 
Hundreds of kilometres to the northeast of Al-Qawalish , another force of rebels is also trying to push toward Tripoli , though they too are facing tough resistance . 
Fighters from the rebel-held city of Misrata , about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , have fought their way west to the outskirts of Zlitan , the first in a chain of coastal towns blocking their progress toward the capital . 
A spokesman for insurgents who are behind the pro-Gaddafi lines and inside Zlitan itself , said they had mounted their second attack on government troops in a week . 
`` The revolutionaries inside the town of Zlitan shelled the -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- brigades positioned on the coastal road on Sunday at 1:00 a.m. -LRB- 2300 GMT -RRB- , killing at least seven people , '' a rebel spokesman , who identified himself as Mabrouk , told Reuters from Zlitan . 
The account could not be verified independently because journalists have not been able to reach the town . 
NATO launched its bombing campaign in March after the U.N. Security Council authorised the use of all necessary means to protect civilians who rose up against Gaddafi . 
Gaddafi says the rebels are armed criminals and al Qaeda militants . 
He has called the NATO operation an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing Libyan oil . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Hey rebels you should never have trusted the old colonial powers . 
They just wanted to stop the flow of oil to get the price up for the real powers which is the big money that owns the oil of the world . 
You should have expected that the french would get you killed in large numbers and do nothing for you . 
US position is simply for Obama to save face . 
His unwise , untimely call for regime change inserted the USA into the domestic politics of Libya ... for no reason . 
Libya 's government if for Libyans to determine , not Barak H. Obama ! 
They were the very first to help the Libyan citizens fighting for their very lives and family members when Kadhafi began slaughtering them . 
Now that the Libyan citizens are on the offensive , the French tell the Libyan citizens to make peace with Khadafi . 
The French politicians should put themselves in the mental shoes of those Libyans that have lost mothers , fathers , brothers , sisters , neighbors , and friends because Kadhafi the `` King of Kings , '' declared war on his own citizens . 
Justice for the Libyan citizens will not be achieved until Kadhafi and his Nazi goons are dead or imprisoned for life .

2011-07-11,"JADU , Libya | Mon Jul 11 , 2011 12:39 pm EDT JADU , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - In a packed classroom on a cool evening near the front line in Libya 's civil war , 15-year-old Mira is teaching children to spell out the names of animals in the ancient Berber script , an act that once could have landed her in one of Muammar Gaddafi 's jails . 
The indigenous people of north Africa , known to others as Berbers and among themselves as Amazigh , were brutally suppressed under Gaddafi , who considered the teaching of their language and culture to be a form of imperialism in his Arab country . 
They have become crucial supporters of the rebellion seeking to topple Gaddafi , with their stronghold in the Nafusa Mountains southwest of Tripoli emerging as one of the main fronts . 
Berber was the main language of North Africa before Arabic arrived with the Muslim conquest in the 7th century . 
It is still spoken in the Sahara and in mountainous parts of Algeria , Morocco and Tunisia as well as Libya . 
Activists say most of the Arabs of North Africa are in fact descended from Amazigh peoples who were there before the arrival of Islam . 
Today , the rebel-held town of Jadu , normally home to about 20,000 people but now swollen with refugees from areas within shelling range of Gaddafi 's troops , has become the center for the rebirth of Amazigh culture and language . 
Shops have painted Amazigh signs above their doors . 
For a few weeks , a radio station has been broadcasting from here in both Arabic and Amazigh , in what Berber activists believe are the first conversations in their language over Libyan airwaves in four decades . 
An Amazigh publishing house has printed four books so far over the past month , billed as Libya 's first publications in the language since Gaddafi seized power . 
And there is Mira 's school , where classes are held six evenings a week from 5:30 to 7:30 pm . 
The children study the Amazigh language at basic and advanced levels , as well as English , and sing songs in the courtyard . 
Their teachers learned Amazigh in secret from their parents at home . 
Nearby is a museum , with local artifacts defiantly labeled in the once-banned script , items bearing the distinctive geometric patterns that Berbers say are part of their heritage . 
Early in his rule , Gaddafi declared that anyone studying the Amazigh language was drinking `` poisoned milk from their mother 's breast , '' explained Fathi Anfusi , a 48-year-old Amazigh activist who escaped Tripoli and arrived in Jadu last month . 
Gaddafi accused Amazigh activists of being on the payroll of Western intelligence agencies and seeking to divide the country . 
Berber activists were rounded up and jailed . 
The hero of their movement , a poet and journalist named Said Mahrooq , was paralyzed after being run down by a car . 
Even giving children Amazigh names was forbidden . 
Anfusi , an agronomist by profession , wanted to name his daughter Tala , a Berber name meaning `` fountain . '' 
He was forced to register her with the Arabic name Hala instead . 
FRIENDS ... FOR THE REVOLUTION Even the Berber name of the Nafusa mountain range was banned . 
On Gaddafi 's maps , the region is known only as the Western Mountains . 
Gaddafi 's government still uses hostility to the Amazigh as part of its propaganda , warning Arabs in nearby towns that Berbers are coming out of the hills to attack them . 
Inside rebel-held territory , Arabs and Berbers say they are united . 
Rebel units from Berber towns like Yefren and Jadu have been fighting side by side with units from Arab towns in the mountains , such as Zintan . 
All fly the same pre-Gaddafi flag and profess similar goals of creating a democratic state . 
But although they fight side by side , the units are still kept separate . 
When they captured the village of al-Qawalish last week , one of the first acts of the rival units was to hurriedly spray-paint the names of their Arab or Berber home towns on village walls . 
An Arab rebel fighter in Zintan winced when this reporter referred to the Nafusa Mountains . 
`` Never say the Nafusa Mountains . 
That 's what the Berbers call it . 
We call it the Western Mountains , '' he said . 
But are n't you all friends ? . 
`` We are friends for now , '' the fighter replied , pausing for a moment to consider . 
`` For the revolution . '' 
Anfusi acknowledges that hostility between Arabs and Berbers will probably outlast Gaddafi 's time in power . 
`` We will discover about each other . 
This will need time . 
Maybe we need five years . 
Maybe ten years to build our country . 
This is our opportunity , '' he said . 
But in his own way , Gaddafi had inadvertently helped . 
The Libyan leader 's crackdown on the rebellion this year had united the Arabs and Berbers of the mountains for the first time , Anfusi said . 
`` The people , they all hate Gaddafi . ''

2011-07-14,"ISTANBUL | Thu Jul 14 , 2011 2:23 pm BST ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Western powers and Arab states meeting in Istanbul on Friday will seek a political solution to end the civil war in Libya , amid conflicting signals over whether Muammar Gaddafi intends to fight on or surrender power . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the EU 's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton are among more than a dozen ministers attending the Libyan contact group meeting , its fourth since an emergency summit in London in March . 
`` The main aim is to find a political solution to accelerate efforts to end the bloodshed , '' said Selcuk Unal , spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry hosting the talks in Istanbul . 
Heads of NATO , the Arab League , African Union and Gulf Cooperation Council will also attend along with representatives of the Libyan opposition . 
The U.N. Secretary-General 's special envoy on Libya , Abdul Elah Al-Khatib , will report results of contacts with the beleaguered Gaddafi government in Tripoli and the rebel National Transitional Council based in the eastern city of Benghazi . 
There will also be updates on the flow of financial and humanitarian assistance to the rebel-held areas . 
Russian and China , two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council that have taken softer line on Gaddafi , were invited for a first time to attend a contact group meeting . 
But China has said it would skip the meeting while it was uncertain who Russia would send . 
Mahmoud Jebril , a senior member of the rebel council , said in Brussels on Wednesday that there had been no negotiations so far with Gaddafi 's regime to end the civil war that began with a popular uprising against his 41-year rule in February . 
Gaddafi is resisting rebel advances on Tripoli from the eastern desert and western mountains , and the drawn-out conflict and lack of substantive talks have frustrated NATO allies who are helping the rebels by enforcing a no-fly zone and bombing Gaddafi forces deemed a threat to civilians . 
The international community wants to ensure that the oil - and gas-rich North African country of 6 million people emerges as a stable democracy rather than falling prey to ethnic or tribal conflict , or becoming a haven for Islamist militants . 
Among items to be discussed in Istanbul will be a recommendation by a British-led team planning post-conflict Libya for Gaddafi 's security forces to be left intact after a rebel victory in order to avoid errors made after the Iraq war . 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said earlier this week that emissaries from Gaddafi 's government were in contact with NATO members , and were saying that Gaddafi was ready to quit . 
A crucial question , should Gaddafi agree to step down , will be whether he is allowed to stay in Libya or has to take refuge in a third country despite a U.N.-backed International Criminal Court investigation into crimes against his people . 
Clinton said on Wednesday in Washington that Gaddafi 's intentions were unclear . 
`` We are still getting contradictory signals from Colonel Gaddafi 's camp , '' she said during a visit by Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . 
`` He has yet to meet the red lines that are set by the international community to cease violence against his people , withdraw his forces and step down from power . '' 
Clinton said the while the United States and Russia could not predict exactly when Gaddafi would go , `` we do understand and agree that his days are numbered '' . 
Lavrov said Moscow 's position on the enforcement of U.N. resolutions on Libya differed somewhat from that of NATO powers , but this would not stop Russian efforts to get peace talks going . 
`` We are united in that we have to start the political process as soon as possible and we have different channels , official and not very official channels , to work through to create conditions for this process , '' he said . 
The White House later issued a statement that President Barack Obama welcomed Russia 's efforts to mediate a political solution and back talks towards a democratic transition so long as Gaddafi stepped aside . 
Turkey and the African Union have proposed separate road maps aimed at establishing a cease-fire and moving through stages from Gaddafi quitting power to a democratic transition , and the contact group will seek to agree on a single plan . 
Turkey 's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has voiced hopes last week that significant progress towards a political solution could be made before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan , which this year falls at the beginning of August .

2011-07-15,"Libya to defend oil with ` blood ' NEW : Government spokesman describes an attack on the oil town of Brega `` It is impossible for me to leave my loyal people , '' the Libyan leader says on state television `` We will win over the campaign of colonization , the campaign of hatred , '' he adds Gadhafi says he wants warm relations with European countries In an unexpected late-night appearance before a hastily assembled group of journalists , a Libyan government spokesman called the attack `` heavy , merciless and surprising . '' 
CNN was not able to reach anyone from NATO or the Transitional National Council , based out of the opposition-held eastern Libyan city of Benghazi , to confirm reports of the Brega attack . 
The government spokesman , Musa Ibrahim , also issued a warning that he said he hoped would make headlines around the world . 
`` We will die for oil . 
We will kill for oil , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` We will kill everyone who comes near our oil . 
Rebels , NATO , we do n't care . 
We will defend our oil to the last drop of blood that we have . '' 
His comments came shortly after Gadhafi used similar imagery in pledging not to knuckle under to international demands that he cede the power he has held tightly for nearly 42 years , and instead said he would remain `` until the last drop of my blood . '' 
`` It is impossible for me to leave my loyal people , '' he told an enthusiastic crowd numbering in the thousands in the western city of Ageelat , in a speech that was broadcast over state television . 
`` I will remain with my people and with my firearm until the last drop of my blood . 
We will win over this unjust campaign . 
We will win over the campaign of colonization , the campaign of hatred . '' 
After Gadhafi spoke , dozens of young men dressed in civilian clothes and carrying shiny new Kalashnikov rifles in a crowded square fired their weapons into the air in celebration . 
One of the participants in the pro-government demonstration said he had a message for Libyan rebels who have been fighting Gadhafi 's forces on three fronts : `` I would tell our brothers in Misrata and Benghazi , stop the bloodshed , '' said Walid Khaila , a 22-year old medical student . 
Libya has been riven by a civil war since shortly after peaceful anti-government protests in February were met by violent crackdowns by government forces . 
That prompted NATO forces in March to launch a campaign of airstrikes against government troops and command-and-control centers , as well as the Libyan leader 's compound in Tripoli . 
Gadhafi said he would welcome warm relations with Europeans , who compose many of the NATO forces . 
`` We want a strong relationship , cooperation and peace with the European people , and not with the war criminals , who must leave immediately , '' he said . 
He added , though , that he and his followers are prepared to endure privation to ensure he remains the leader of Libya . 
`` We are ready to live without electricity , without benzene , without buildings , and without air conditioning , '' he said . 
`` But our firearms are in our hands to fight until the end . '' 
Their statements came on the same day that Libya 's prime minister warned Western governments they were looking at their last opportunity to engage in oil deals with Tripoli . 
`` Now is the last chance for any nation contributing to the aggression to review their policy , '' Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi said after meeting with top Libyan oil industry executives . 
He said any future oil deals with Italy and its energy giant ENI were already off the table . 
Rome and Tripoli were close trading partners until the conflict erupted in Libya last winter . 
Tripoli has said that ENI alone invested tens of billions of dollars in Libya 's oil and natural gas industry . 
Italy scrapped a friendship treaty with Libya last February , in the wake of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi 's bloody crackdown on peaceful opposition demonstrators . 
Later , Italy joined the NATO bombing campaign of Gadhafi 's forces , after the United Nations Security Council passed two resolutions authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians . 
Also Thursday , the United Nations reported it completed a four-day humanitarian assessment mission to the port city of Misrata , site of intense fighting in recent months . 
Though aspects of normalcy have returned to the city , it remains surrounded by government forces and exposed to intermittent rocket attacks , the world body said in a release . 
Misrata is 210 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli on the Mediterranean and , because of the government forces around it , can be reached only by sea . 
Though some shops and markets have reopened , rising food prices , a shortage of supplies and a lack of cash mean that most residents have been short of food . 
The World Food Programme said that , since April , it has distributed 2,634 metric tons of food in Misrata to 125,000 people .

2011-07-15,"ISTANBUL | Fri Jul 15 , 2011 1:20 pm EDT ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States Friday recognized Libya 's rebel National Transitional Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- as a legitimate government , a diplomatic boost which could unlock billions of dollars in frozen assets . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Washington would extend formal recognition to the Benghazi-based TNC until a fully representational interim government can be established . 
`` The TNC has offered important assurances today , including the promise to pursue a process of democratic reform that is inclusive both geographically and politically , '' Clinton said in prepared remarks . 
`` Until an interim authority is in place , the United States will recognize the TNC as the legitimate governing authority for Libya , and we will deal with it on that basis . '' 
Clinton 's announcement came as the Libya Contact Group , meeting in Istanbul , formally recognized the opposition as the representative of the Libyan people -- sealing its diplomatic status as the successor government to embattled leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
The contact group , made up of more than 30 governments and international and regional organizations , also authorized U.N. special envoy Abdul Elah Al-Khatib to present terms for Gaddafi to leave power in a political package that will include a ceasefire to halt fighting in the civil war . 
Clinton said any deal `` must involve Gaddafi 's departure '' from power and a halt to violence . 
`` Increasingly the people of Libya are looking past Gaddafi . 
They know , as we all know , that it is no longer a question of whether Gaddafi will leave power , but when , '' she said . 
U.S. officials said the decision on formal diplomatic recognition marked an important step toward unblocking more than $ 34 billion in Libyan assets in the United States but cautioned it could still take time to get funds flowing to the cash-strapped Benghazi council . 
`` We expect this step on recognition will enable the TNC to access additional sources of funding , '' Clinton told reporters after the meeting , saying Washington would discuss with allies `` the most effective and appropriate method '' to do this . 
They also said no decisions had been made on upgrading U.S. representation in Benghazi -- now a small office headed by special envoy Chris Stevens -- or on bringing the TNC into the United Nations and other international organizations . 
Clinton acknowledged that the United States had `` taken its time '' in deciding on formal recognition of the TNC , but now firmly believed this was the way forward . 
`` We think they are have made great strides and are on the right path , '' she said . 
U.S. President Barack Obama signed an executive order on February 25 freezing the assets of Gaddafi , his family and top officials , as well as the Libyan government , the country 's central bank and sovereign wealth funds . 
Most of the frozen assets are liquid in the form of cash and securities . 
U.S. officials have pledged to free up some of the money for the TNC , which has run dangerously short of cash to pay for salaries and basic services even as it takes on more of the responsibilities of government . 
But discussions with Congress on mechanisms to free up the money ran into legal complications -- some of which could be swept away by U.S. recognition of the TNC as Libya 's legitimate government . 
`` Our hope is that in a relatively short time frame we will be able to make progress -LRB- on funds -RRB- but there 's a lot of moving pieces here , '' one senior State Department official said . 
The United States could direct banks to transfer frozen funds directly to the TNC , but this might still run foul of U.N. financial sanctions in place on Libya . 
A second option would be for the United States to establish a line of credit backed by the frozen assets as several other countries have done . 
Clinton 's announcement formally recognizing the TNC marked the end of a process which began in February when Obama declared that Gaddafi had lost his legitimacy as Libya 's leader because of his brutal response to anti-government protesters . 
`` We wanted to send a very clear signal to Gaddafi and the people around him that we are looking past Gaddafi to a future without him , '' the senior U.S. official said . 
`` We felt that taking this step today sends that message loud and clear . '' 
The United States closed its embassy in Tripoli in February and withdrew its diplomatic staff , but maintains embassy staff working in Washington to develop ties with the TNC . 
The United States and Gaddafi 's government have been estranged for most of the past four decades , and only resumed contacts in 2003 when Tripoli gave up its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and took responsibility for its role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland .

2011-07-16,"U.S. recognizes Libyan rebels ' authority By the CNN Wire Staff U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after a press conference at the meeting of the Libya Contact Group in Istanbul Friday . 
He says he 's wildly popular in Libya and derides `` traitors '' Hillary Clinton states the new policy at Libya Contact Group meeting in Turkey The Transitional National Council is a main organization for the opposition Istanbul -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States now recognizes the main opposition group in Libya `` as the legitimate governing authority '' in a country that Moammar Gadhafi has long ruled with an iron first , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday . 
U.S. recognition of the Transitional National Council is a major diplomatic policy shift that could give the rebels access to Libyan regime assets that have been frozen by the United States . 
Clinton announced the change in Istanbul at a meeting of the Libya Contact Group , the alliance of nations working to deal with the Libyan crisis . 
Applause rippled through the audience as she spoke . 
Clinton said the Transitional National Council , also known as the TNC , `` continues to gain legitimacy as the representative of the Libyan people '' and conducts `` high-level diplomacy with governments worldwide . '' 
`` So I am announcing today that , until an interim authority is in place , the United States will recognize the TNC as the legitimate governing authority for Libya , and we will deal with it on that basis . '' 
The United States had previously stopped short of giving this recognition to the council , but Clinton said the body , based in Benghazi , Libya , `` has offered important assurances today . '' 
They include `` the promise to pursue a process of democratic reform that is inclusive both geographically and politically , to uphold Libya 's international obligations and to disburse funds in a transparent manner to address the humanitarian and other needs of the Libyan people . '' 
The United States `` appreciates these assurances from the TNC , which reinforce our confidence that it is the appropriate interlocutor for us in dealing with Libya 's present and addressing Libya 's future . '' 
In Zintan , rebel military commander Hajj Ousama Jwaili , a commander in the western mountains , said Friday that he considers the announcement `` another indication of support by the international community toward the rebel fighters . '' 
He added , `` This is an appreciated move by the U.S. , and more countries should do the same . '' 
Gadhafi reacted with derision to the U.S. announcement . 
`` Their decisions , meetings , recognitions and their statements are all under your feet -- trample on them , '' he said Friday in an audio message , purportedly taped in Zlitan and broadcast on state-run television . 
`` This is our answer to all the decisions they took against the Libyan people . '' 
The Libyan leader urged the NATO powers and others to take heed of what he said was his continuing popularity in Libya . 
`` You in America , Europe , Russia and everywhere , look ! 
Look at the millions . 
Look at the Libyan people . 
More than 5 million people carrying the pictures of Gadhafi are ready for jihad and for martyrdom . '' 
He called for `` traitors '' to give up their effort to overthrow his regime , warning that failure to comply will have consequences . 
`` They must abandon their weapons and turn themselves in from Benghazi to Misrata to Zintan , '' he said . 
`` We will not hold anyone who turns in his weapons accountable . 
If this does not happen , the march of millions will take place . '' 
The Libyan uprising began in February , when opposition forces began fighting to oust Gadhafi and his regime . 
NATO forces have been operating under a U.N. mandate in Libya to protect people from aggression by Gadhafi forces . 
Clinton said the United States `` will help the TNC sustain its commitment to the sovereignty , independence , territorial integrity and national unity of Libya , and we will look to it to remain steadfast in its commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms . '' 
`` In contrast , the United States views the Gadhafi regime as no longer having any legitimate authority in Libya , '' she said . 
Diplomatic efforts have been ongoing to end the crisis , and Clinton said Libyans are `` looking past Gadhafi . '' 
`` They know , as we all know , that it is no longer a question of whether Gadhafi will leave power but when . '' 
Clinton said the coalition will continue to target Gadhafi 's command and control if he keeps threatening the citizenry . 
`` The terms of a cease-fire are clear . 
Gadhafi must stop attacks or the threat of attacks , remove his troops from all of the places they have forcibly entered and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance . 
`` The terms of a political process that will produce a cease-fire and pave the way to a democratic Libya are also clear . 
It must involve Gadhafi 's departure and an inclusive effort to build a new constitutional framework that redeems the democratic aspirations of all the Libyan people . '' 
As for the recognition step , a senior State Department official reiterated that the rebel council 's political and economic assurances `` turned the tide '' in their favor . 
`` We sent a very clear signal ... to the TNC that we recognize them as the future of Libya , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . 
`` As such , we 're going to take steps to make sure that they 're able to carry out their functions . '' 
A final statement issued by the Contact Group raised a range of points , including an agreement by the participants `` to deal '' with the Transitional National Council `` as the legitimate governing authority '' in the country `` until an interim authority is in place . '' 
It also welcomed monetary pledges and encouraged financial help . 
`` Noting that the unfolding situation in Libya since mid-February has disrupted the operations of foreign companies and contractors , the Contact Group welcomed the commitment of the -LRB- Transitional National Council -RRB- to open up Libya to foreign investment as soon as possible and its commitment to honor any existing legal contracts signed under the Gadhafi regime , '' it said . 
It also cited `` the need for establishment of a genuine cease-fire and provision of safe humanitarian access remain as urgent as ever . '' 
The group `` urged all relevant parties to explore ways and means of paving the way for the formation of an interim government to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition of power with the widest popular support possible , '' it said . 
CNN 's Elise Labott and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report .

2011-07-16,"BENGHAZI Middle Eastern autocrats routinely warn their people of rivers of blood , Western occupation , poverty , chaos , and Al Qaeda if their regimes are toppled . 
Those threats were heard in Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and rendered in black-comedy style in Libya . 
But there is a strong belief across the region that the costs of removing autocracies , as high as they might be , are low compared to the damage inflicted by the current rulers . 
In short , freedom is worth the price . 
In Libya , four scenarios may negatively affect prospects for democratization : civil\/tribal war , military rule , becoming stuck in transition , and partition . 
Given the high price Libyans have paid , those scenarios should be prevented rather than cured . 
The civil\/tribal war scenario is the worst risk . 
Egypt s revolutionaries understood this . 
When sectarian violence erupted there following the removal of Hosni Mubarak , the revolutionary coalitions adopted the slogan , You won t gloat over this , Mubarak . 
Repressive dictatorships can not win free and fair elections . 
But they can use extreme violence to consolidate their control over the state , its people and its institutions . 
So , to win , Libya s Colonel Moammar Gadhafi has deliberately and successfully turned a civil-resistance campaign into an armed conflict . 
That will have ramifications in the post-authoritarian context . 
A study published by Columbia University on civil resistance has shown that the probability of a country relapsing into civil war following a successful anti-dictatorship armed campaign is 43 % , versus 28 % when the campaign is unarmed . 
According to the same study , which was based on 323 cases of armed and unarmed opposition campaigns between 1900 and 2006 , the likelihood of democratic transition within five years following a successful armed opposition campaign is only 3 % , compared to 51 % when campaigns were unarmed . 
Libya , of course , can survive the gloomy prospect of post-authoritarian civil war . 
But this requires containing tribal and regional polarization , as well as the rivalries between the Interim National Council -LRB- INC -RRB- and the Military Council -LRB- MC -RRB- , and between senior military commanders . 
Violent polarization has developed not only between Eastern and Western tribes , but also between some of the Western tribes . 
Last month , for example , armed clashes erupted between rebels in al-Zintan and the villagers of al-Rayyaniya , 15 kilometers away . 
Six people were killed a reminder of what can happen if violent polarization continues between neighboring towns and villages . 
Vendetta politics is not unknown in Libya , and , in an armed society comprising more than 120 tribes including around 30 with significant numbers and resources it can become extremely dangerous . 
Another negative scenario is military rule . 
Several figures from the free officers the group that plotted the 1969 coup against the monarchy are leading the INC. . 
They include General Abd al-Fattah Younis , General Soliman Mahmoud , Colonel Khalifa Haftar , Major Mohamed Najm , and others . 
Those figures hold a mix of historical legitimacy , for participating in the 1969 coup , and current legitimacy , for helping the 17th February revolution . 
They also belong to several large tribes , guaranteeing wide tribal representation if a military council were to take power , as in Egypt . 
Unlike Egypt , however , whoever takes power in Libya will not necessarily inherit poor economic conditions that could threaten their legitimacy and undermine their popularity . 
This might lead a group of senior officers to rule directly , especially if victory in Libya comes militarily . 
A move by army officers in Tripoli against Gadhafi and his sons might end the conflict , with military commanders getting the credit and the political capital . 
But four decades of military-based dictatorship may be enough for Libyans , a majority of whom never really benefited from their country s wealth or potential . 
When it comes to producing terrorists and undocumented immigrants two critical issues for Europe Arab military dictators have an inglorious record . 
Algeria in the 1990 s is a potent reminder of this , and Western governments do not want the vicious cycle of repressive autocrats producing violent theocrats and refugees to restart . 
Getting `` stuck in transition '' Getting stuck in transition is a third possible scenario , with Libya remaining in a gray zone neither a fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship , but semi-free . 
This means regular elections , a democratic constitution , and civil society , coupled with electoral fraud , skewed representation , human rights violations , and restrictions on civil liberties . 
Getting stuck in transition usually kills the momentum for democratic change , and widespread corruption , weak state institutions , and lack of security serve to reinforce a myth of the just autocrat . 
Vladimir Putin s rule in Russia illustrates this outcome . 
Unfortunately , a study published in the Journal of Democracy showed that out of the 100 countries that were designated in transition between 1970 and 2000 , only 20 became fully democratic -LRB- for example , Chile , Argentina , Poland , and Taiwan -RRB- . 
Five relapsed into brutal dictatorships -LRB- including Uzbekistan , Algeria , Turkmenistan , and Belarus -RRB- , while the rest were stuck somewhere in transition . 
Given Libya s lack of democratic experience , some view this as a likely outcome in the post-Gadhafi era . 
But Libya is not the only country that has tried to move from dictatorship to democracy with weak institutions and strong tribal identities . 
Albania , Mongolia , and India successfully passed more complicated tests and offer some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavourable conditions . 
The fourth scenario is partition , with the old three-province , Ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned : Cyrenaica -LRB- east -RRB- , Fezzan -LRB- south -RRB- , and Tripolitania -LRB- west -RRB- . 
Cyrenaica is Gadhafi-free , Tripolitania is not , and Fezzan did not fully join the revolution . 
But the administrative borders of these districts were never fully established , and they have changed at least eight times since 1951 . 
In 2007 , Libya had 22 sha biya -LRB- administrative districts -RRB- , not three . 
All of these scenarios will be affected by outcomes in Egypt and Tunisia . 
In the case of democratic transitions , a success nearby often helps at home . 
Either country , or both , could offer Libya successful transition models , erecting an important obstacle to military dictatorship or civil war . 
The views expressed in this article are solely those of Omar Ashour . 
www.project-syndicate.org The above may be quite true in Yemen and in fact , is but in Libya it 's a different story . 
What the people in the right-wing news media wo n't and never will talk about is the way Mohammar Qadaffy greatly helped the Libyan people after the 1969 revolution . 
For instance , the litteracy rate in Libya was 15 % in 1970 and today is 85 % while the poor gradually became less poor and hospitals , bridges and schools were built which otherwise would not have happened under King Idris . 
If the `` rebels '' triumph there with the help of NATO , Libya will only degenerate into another pro-Western Arab police state !! July 17 , 2011 at 12:39 am | Reply You talk about the 60s and 70s ... What about 21st century Gaddafi ? 
I noticed that you stand very quiet to the ` wonderful ' things he has done in the past years .20 % unemployment while Gaddafi supporting Migrant workers did all the jobs , yes that 's a wonderful gift he gave the Libyan people , and while western half of Libya and Tripoli prospered from the Oil Wealth ... the eastern part of the nation was ignored . 
When you have a lot of young , smart , bored , people feeling hopeless , that breeds rebellion . 
As for the Rebels in the mountains , that was caused by Gaddafi 's demand that they abandon everything about themselves for his culture . 
People do n't like that .

Today , Egypt still lacks an elected government and is lost in transition . 
With so many tribes that are scattered all over Libya , there would be tribal conflicts , if unity is unthinkable . 
Also an internal struggle between former members of the regime within the Transitional National Council and the Military Council could break out , if no consensus can be reached . 
I wish the Libyans the best of luck .

The head of the rebellion could sign the treaty giving them land in the East next to the borders of Egypt with Benghazi as their capital city and Gaddafi having the land to the West next to the borders of Algeria and Tunisia with Tripoli as his capital city . 
Thus , giving both the rebels freedom and democracy they desire and Gaddafi control and rule he desires . 
With this peace agreement , this will end the conflict and the Libyan economy will not be affected .

There 's also a strong belief among those who believe in democratic change , that majority rule is absolutely critical . 
Something RARELY discussed in the media , even among propagandists like Omar Ashour , if the majority of the population supports the current `` regime '' , how is it that a well-armed rebellion minority can seek democratic change with outside foriegn influence attacking the interests of the majority ?

Why no comparison to the dreadful experience in Iraq , with which the Libyan war bears so many similarities -- intervention based on lies , a relatively prosperous country ruled by someone deemed a `` bad guy '' by the West , and the fact that both countries did not have to answer to the IMF . 
Also , whereas the Egypt and Tunisia revolts had partcipation from large numbers of protestors , the rebels\/insurgents in Libya were and remain a small minority -- and the revolt or civil war only exists because of foreign\/Nato intervention .

By the way , there is nothing `` anti-American '' about facing the realities of intervention in foreign countries -- our recent errors should not be blindly repeated . 
Lastly , I do not `` blithely dismiss '' the rebels\/insurgents in Libya . 
It is the Libyan people who do not support them , whether you like it or not . 
There are plenty of videos in recent weeks of massive demonstrations against Nato and in favor of the current Libyan gov ` t. Can you point us to anything which shows that the rebels\/terrorists\/insurgents have broad popular support -LRB- within Libya , that is , and not in Nato capitals -RRB- ?

You brought up the subject . 
the burden of proof is on you . 
What you do is typical of those in support of islmaic dictatorships and terrorism . 
You repeat the manta , `` Everyone else does it . '' 
You did the same erroneous cop-out with grammar . 
Rather than stay on the subjet to face your own mistakes , you pointed to the errors of others to rationalize your own .

Jjust someone does n't agree with you does n't mean they support islamic dictatorships and terrorism . 
I think it is a fair question to ask just where is the support that the rebels have ... We are told that they represent the Libyan people but they seem to be a small minority . 
If the US is trying to support a group that even the Libyans do n't want then we are only causing trouble . 
July 20 , 2011 at 5:47 am | Reply The question was not one of support . 
It was one of comparison . 
To believe that Libya has anything less than a razor to the throat of Libyans is naive in the extreme . 
Qaddafi has never lost an election . 
His image is everywhere . 
There is no public dissent -- none . 
Rather disingenuous to propose that for forty years , the whole populace has been of one opinion . 
CNN doers not report Libyans themselves , en mass , opposing the rebels , other than Big Brother soundbites .

2011-07-16,"Libyan rebels prepare to fire a rocket on the frontline south of the town of Bir Ghanam , July 16 , 2011 . 
FRONT LINE NEAR BIR GHANAM , Libya | Sat Jul 16 , 2011 7:34 pm EDT FRONT LINE NEAR BIR GHANAM , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Ten Libyan rebels were reported killed and 172 wounded in an attack on the eastern oil port of Brega on Saturday , while insurgents drove back forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi in the west . 
In the latest of a series of speeches apparently designed to show he enjoys support in the areas he controls , Gaddafi described the rebels as worthless traitors and rejected suggestions that he was about to leave the country . 
`` They said Gaddafi will go to Honolulu , '' he said in a televised speech . 
`` This is funny : To leave the graves of my forefathers and my people ? 
Are you serious ? '' 
His defiance came a day after Western and Arab powers , led by the United States , said the rebel leadership was the legitimate government of Libya . 
Reports have circulated that Gaddafi is seeking a negotiated way out of the crisis . 
Libyan television also reported what it called an `` enemy attack '' on Tajoura district east of Tripoli early on Sunday , the first such bombing raid by NATO near the capital in several nights , a Reuters witness said . 
The television said the strike had hit `` civilian and military sites '' but did not specify what they were or mention if there had been any casualties . 
Brega 's oil resources make it a prize for the rebels , who have been trying to dislodge Gaddafi 's troops in the face of rocket bombardments , according to Al Jazeera television . 
Most opposition fighters are about 20 km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- outside Brega , kept back by Grad rockets fired by government forces , the network reported . 
The rebels had however captured four government soldiers . 
In the Western Mountains , where insurgents are trying to push toward Tripoli , heavy fighting erupted on Saturday . 
Sustained gunfire and volleys of artillery could be heard from the village of Bir Ayad , 15 km -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- south of the front line at the town of Bir Ghanam . 
Rebels at Bir Ghanam hold the high ground on the outskirts of the town , their closest position to Tripoli , about 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- away . 
Ahmed , a rebel fighter in Bir Ayad , said a convoy of about 15 vehicles from Gaddafi 's forces tried to approach Bir Ghanam , but the rebels fired at it and the convoy retreated after a about an hour of shooting . 
`` They were in a column at first but when we started firing they split into groups of three or four vehicles and all of them fled , '' local rebel commander Fathi Alzintani told Reuters . 
Rebels in the Western Mountains have made progress in recent weeks after repelling assaults by Gaddafi 's forces . 
Their next goal is Garyan , a town that controls the highway south from Tripoli . 
But the rebels have been hampered by divisions , ill-discipline and supply problems . 
In Misrata , the rebels ' main stronghold in the west , six rebel fighters have been killed and four injured in the past 24 hours , hospital staff said . 
Away from the battlefield , Gaddafi has made a series of audio speeches to coincide with state television broadcasts of rallies attended by thousands of people in Tripoli and elsewhere . 
As loyalists gathered on the streets of the town of Zawiyah , near the capital , on Saturday , Gaddafi said the rebels were `` apostates '' who had `` become Christians . '' 
Calling on the rebels to lay down their arms , he said : `` Islam is being humiliated by the cross ... They are burning mosques with bombs . '' 
`` We have given martyrs , yes ... It 's impossible to compromise or make the slightest concession . '' 
Crowds were shown firing to the air at the end of the speech . 
Rebel leaders received a boost in their campaign to oust Gaddafi on Friday when they won recognition as the legitimate government of Libya from the United States and other powers . 
Western nations said they planned to increase the military pressure on Gaddafi 's forces to make him to give up power after 41 years at the head of the North African state . 
Recognition of the rebels by the international contact group on Libya is an important diplomatic step that could unlock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds . 
The decision came as reports circulated Gaddafi had sent out emissaries seeking a negotiated end to the conflict , although he remains defiant in public . 
The contact group also agreed on a road map whereby Gaddafi should relinquish power and put forward plans for Libya 's transition to democracy under the rebel National Transitional Council . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
We 're nothing but war mongers anyway . 
Maybe God has chosen us for destruction , and with good reason ! 
Above all , the European Union must start acting like a responsible force in world affairs , not a many-headed monster . 
The Financial Times published that on February 23 , right as the civil war in Libya erupted . 
Unfortunately , Europe along with America has continued to act like a many-headed monster , particularly in Libya . 
To begin with , the West failed to help countries like Libya develop their economies before the war began . 
In fact , the West promised to help Libya develop its economy after Libya agreed to abandon its nuclear program . 
But instead of doing that , the West seemed happy to support and encourage organizations intent on overthrowing the existing regime . 
In particular , Britain supported the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , a terrorist organization linked to Al Qaeda whose objective was to overthrow Gaddafi . 
In 1996 , British intelligence even hired that organization to assassinate Gaddafi . 
Britain has connections to several members of LIFG . 
The founder of LIFG , Norman Benotman , has lived in London since 1995 . 
While living in London , he met members of Al Qaeda such as Abu Qatada and Mustafa Setmariam Nasar . 
Before moving to London , he lived in Sudan where he met with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri . 
Britain also has connections to another member of LIFG , Anas al-Liby . 
He also knew Osama bin Laden . 
Despite the fact that America believes he had a role in the 1998 African embassy bombings , Britain gave him political asylum and allowed him to live in Manchester until May of 2000 . 
Interestingly , Libya issued an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden in March of 1998 . 
At that time , British and American intelligence tried to conceal the origins of the arrest warrant and they minimized the danger of bin Laden . 
The fact that Britain provided sanctuary to two members of LIFG and the fact the Britain paid LIFG to assassinate Gaddafi suggests strongly that Britain controls the organization . 
And the fact that British and American intelligence tried to squash an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden suggests they controlled him as well .

2011-07-18,"By Ivan Watson , Raja Razek and Jomana Karadsheh , CNN Gadhafi backers rally in Zawiyah A boat with Libyan asylum-seekers is rescued off Lampedusa coast Warplanes launch sustained bombardgment of Tripoli suburb Libyan leader condemns foes in fiery speech Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fighting between Libyan rebels and government troops raged around the eastern Libyan oil town of Brega throughout the weekend as NATO warplanes launched a sustained pre-dawn raid on Tripoli 's eastern suburbs . 
Distant explosions shook windows in central Tripoli for more than an hour during the raid , launched about 1 a.m. Sunday . 
NATO said later that the targets were warehouses full of Libyan tanks , troop carriers and ammunition in Tajoura , about 16 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from the city 's center . 
The Western alliance has been bombarding Libya since late March a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from forces loyal to longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi , who is attempting to put down a revolt against his nearly 42-year rule . 
The strike on Tajoura followed `` extensive intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance '' of the target , the allied command reported Sunday . 
According to NATO , `` the military equipment deployed from this facility was used to resupply pro-Gadhafi forces launching attacks on civilians . '' 
A surface-to-air missile launcher and radar sites were also hit during the strike , which began shortly after midnight Sunday . 
It was the first time in several days that the alliance targeted Tripoli and its immediate surroundings . 
Food shortages in Western Libya Sunday 's events followed a rally by mounted by pro-Gadhafi rallies in Zawiyah , west of Tripoli , where more than 10,000 portrait-waving demonstrators gathered amid a sea of green flags in the city 's cratered and pock-marked central square . 
Zawiyah was the scene of intense fighting last winter , in the early days of the anti-Gadhafi uprising that has left this country bitterly divided . 
Gadhafi 's forces eventually succeeded in capturing the city , but recovery appears to have barely begun in its war-torn heart . 
Municipal buildings and a hotel overlooking the central square still stand gutted , windows broken and facades still singed by fires . 
A vacant lot filled with sand marks the spot where a government minder said a mosque once stood . 
The mosque was apparently completely bulldozed in the months since Zawiyah was re-captured . 
The rooftop of a conference center was still littered with sandbags , bullet casings , several military helmets and bottles stuffed with rags apparently for use as petrol bombs -- evidence that rebels fought from this roof before their defeat last winter . 
The demonstration in Zawiyah , less than a half-hour 's drive from the Libyan capital , was the third pro-Gadhafi rally in as many days . 
But unlike the previous rallies in the towns of Zlitan and Ajilat , there was a much larger security presence -- and members of the crowd were much more aggressive toward foreign journalists who were bused into the city by government minders . 
The men , women and children who attended the rally , many of whom traveled by bus and car from nearby Tripoli , appeared fanatically devoted to Gadhafi . 
`` Allah , Moammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , Libya only , '' chanted many men and women , some of whom beat their chests in devotion as they repeated the slogan . 
As he had in previous rallies , Gadhafi addressed his supporters with an audio message that denounced the rebel-held enclaves in the west , center and east of the country . 
He also denounced the foreign governments that recently declared the rebel Transitional National Council , based in the eastern city of Benghazi , as the sole legitimate government in Libya . 
`` You agents , you traitors , start looking for survival , '' Gadhafi said , in comments that were simulcasted on Libyan state TV . 
`` There will be no survival anywhere , get out of Benghazi , you traitors . '' 
Saturday 's rally looked like a victory celebration as well as a declaration to Libya and the rest of the world that Zawiyah was now firmly in Gadhafi 's hands . 
But there were signs Gadhafi 's forces still had concerns about security in Zawiyah . 
A CNN journalist driving through the city hours before the rally officially took place saw security forces lining up three men who had apparently been detained against a wall . 
And the reinforced presence included soldiers and police who used their vehicles to block off side roads leading to the main road running through the city .

2011-07-18,"MISRATA , Libya | Mon Jul 18 , 2011 6:34 pm EDT MISRATA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebel forces have routed most of Muammar Gaddafi 's troops in the Libyan oil town of Brega in the biggest boost of their campaign in weeks , spokesmen said on Monday . 
The government denied the claim . 
More than 40 people on both sides were reported killed in fighting over the city since late last week . 
The rebels have encircled Brega , an oil export terminal with a refinery which for months marked the eastern limit of Gaddafi 's control , said spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah . 
But its streets were strewn with landmines , making it hard to secure full control of the area . 
`` The main body -LRB- of Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- retreated to Ras Lanuf , '' which lies to the west , he said by telephone from the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi . 
However , government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said that , `` our brave soldiers and volunteer soldiers are in Brega in their thousands and control it completely . '' 
`` NATO and the rebels have tried to attack Brega for the last five days , '' he told foreign journalists in the capital Tripoli . 
`` The only way for them to control Brega is to attack it with nuclear bombs . '' 
He said the government had lost 30 soldiers over five days of fighting , but rebels had lost many times more . 
Abdulmolah said 12 rebels were killed and some 300 wounded on Saturday and Sunday . 
Most rebel forces were now past Brega and heading west toward the towns of Bishr and Ugayla , he said . 
While rebel fighters have been making gains in eastern and western Libya in recent days , Russia criticized the United States and other countries for recognizing the rebel leadership as the legitimate government of Libya , saying they were taking sides in the insurgents ' five-month-old war to oust Gaddafi . 
`` Those who declare recognition stand fully on the side of one political force in a civil war , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced U.S. recognition of the rebels on Friday , a major diplomatic step that could unblock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds . 
Russia and China have taken a softer line toward Libyan leader Gaddafi , and neither attended an international meeting on the conflict in Turkey on Friday . 
Brega , about 750 km -LRB- 465 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , has a strategic oil terminal . 
The attack could signal a new rebel push westwards after weeks of stalemate . 
It has changed hands several times in the back-and-forth fighting along Libya 's Mediterranean coast since the rebellion began in February . 
Libyan TV , in a bid to counter the rebel claims , showed what it said was footage taken on Monday in Brega . 
Students were shown taking an exam , and there were pictures of the port , oil terminal and a worker at a natural gas plant in the city . 
Rebels say taking Brega will this time be a tipping point in the conflict on the eastern front . 
`` It is going to take the revolutionaries at least 10 days to claim full control of Brega , '' said rebel spokesman Abdelsalam in Misrata . 
Gaddafi is refusing to step down despite the five-month-old rebellion against his rule , a campaign of NATO air strikes , and the defections of members of his inner circle . 
The slow progress of the rebel military campaign has caused strains within NATO , some member states pressing for a negotiated solution to hasten the end of a conflict some thought would last only a few weeks . 
Reports have circulated that Gaddafi is seeking a negotiated way out of the crisis , but on Saturday he called the rebels worthless traitors and rejected the idea he was about to leave the country . 
NATO said it had on Monday struck an antenna radar system , which was being used for military purposes at Tripoli 's main airport . 
Naji Daw , acting director of civil aviation at the airport , told journalists the target had purely civilian use . 
NATO warplanes have also been attacking pro-Gaddafi forces near Brega . 
The alliance said targets hit on Friday included one tank , five armored fighting vehicles and two rocket launchers . 
On another front , in the Western Mountains region southwest of Tripoli , pro-Gaddafi forces exchanged artillery fire on Sunday with rebels in the village of Al-Qawalish , a rebel fighter manning a checkpoint there told Reuters . 
A rebel spokesman in the regional town of Zintan said rebels had repelled a bid by Gaddafi troops to enter the town .

2011-07-18,"MOSCOW | Mon Jul 18 , 2011 7:12 am EDT MOSCOW -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Russia criticised on Monday the United States and other countries that have recognized the rebel National Transitional Council as Libya 's legitimate government , saying they were taking sides in the civil war . 
Setting Russia apart from the West , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said nations that recognized the rebel National Transition Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- were pursuing a `` policy of isolation '' he suggested could undermine efforts to end the five-month war . 
`` Those who declare such recognition stand fully on the side of one political force in a civil war , '' Lavrov said . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the recognition at a meeting in Turkey on Friday of an international contact group on Libya , which is seeking a political solution that would remove Muammar Gaddafi from power . 
The major diplomatic step could unblock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds . 
Russia , which in the past has warned the contact group not to try to eclipse the authority of the U.N. Security Council , was invited to the meeting for the first time along with China , but both decided not to get involved . 
Russia has also said Gaddafi must go , but has criticised the Western bombing campaign and urged talks between rebels and the government . 
Lavrov suggested that recognizing the rebel council as Libya 's sole legitimate government would not help . 
`` Supporters of such a decision are supporters of a policy of isolation , in this case the isolation of those forces that represent Tripoli , '' said Lavrov , adding that Moscow is in contact with both Tripoli and the rebels . 
`` We ... reject isolation as a method of solving problems and support inclusion , '' Lavrov said . 
He said the sides should `` show responsibility for the fate of the people and the country and sit at the negotiating table '' for a `` focused , very concrete dialogue about the conditions under which transitional structures could be formed . '' 
Those structures would prepare for reforms , legislative changes and `` free and democratic elections , '' he said . 
Russia , which has veto power and a permanent U.N. Security Council member , abstained from voting on the March resolution that authorised the Western force in Libya but has accused the NATO nations involved of overstepping their mandate .

2011-07-19,"NEW : A government spokesman vows Gadhafi 's forces will hold al-Brega NEW : `` We will turn Brega into hell '' Rebel officer : Gadhafi troops set an oil-filled trench ablaze as a line of defense The rebels claim they are moving ahead slowly but steadily Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan government troops will turn the strategic oil city of al-Brega into `` hell '' rather than let it fall into the hands of advancing rebel forces , a government spokesman said Monday . 
Rebel forces moved to within 9 km -LRB- 5.6 miles -RRB- of al-Brega over the weekend after dismantling thousands of land mines , a rebel spokesman said . 
But government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told CNN that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi remained in full control of the eastern city late Monday . 
`` Defending Brega is so vital to the livelihood of the Libyan nation , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` We will turn Brega into hell . 
We will not give Brega up , even if this causes the death of thousands of rebels and the destruction of the whole city . '' 
Ibrahim said Gadhafi 's troops successfully fought off waves of rebel attacks over the last five days , with 30 government troops and 500 rebel fighters killed . 
The claim could not be independently verified . 
Col. Ahmed Banni , a spokesman for the rebel Transitional National Council , said fighting broke out over the weekend after the rebels pulled out thousands of land mines and secured a path for movement toward the strategic oil town . 
Pro-Gadhafi troops dug a trench and filled it with oil only to set it alight as a line of defense near the eastern entrance of the city , he said . 
`` So this may delay our plan to take over the city , since they have linked the trench to an oil pipeline so they keep the fire going , '' Banni added . 
A rebel fighter who did not want to be named said a small rebel force entered the city and clashed with pro-Gadhafi forces , killing at least 11 and injuring dozens among rebel ranks . 
Gadhafi forces withdrew ahead of the rebels , but re-grouped and launched a counter-attack , Banni said . 
`` I can tell that the communication between the Gadhafi brigades is not too good , since they did not immediately fire at our expeditionary troops with Grad missiles . 
That 's what they usually do , but there was hesitation this time , '' Banni said . 
U.S. to Libya : Gadhafi must go U.S. , Libya officials in talks Food shortages in Western Libya Officials with the Gadhafi government in Tripoli have denounced the assault on al-Brega . 
At the start of the latest round of fighting on Thursday , Ibrahim accused the NATO alliance of coordinating with rebels to mount a land , sea and air attack . 
He said the attack exceeded the mandate of United Nations Security Council resolutions that authorize the use of force in order to protect Libyan civilians . 
In the meantime , NATO announced it struck more targets in the Libyan capital on Monday . 
For the first time , NATO forces attacked Tripoli 's main international airport . 
Libyan officials brought journalists to see a radar tower that was bombed in a predawn attack . 
The remarkably precise strike damaged only the top of the radar tower , while also shattering windows in a neighboring office building . 
A NATO military statement accused the Tripoli regime of using the radar device to track warplanes and warn pro-Gadhafi forces of impending airstrikes . 
Officials at the airport scoffed at these claims . 
`` It is 100 % civilian , '' said acting airport director Naji Daw , pointing at the twisted metal at the top of the red-and-white tower . 
Daw said two people were lightly wounded by the attack . 
`` They want us to go back to 100 years ago , '' he said , adding that the airport will now have to rely on an outdated back-up system to track air traffic . 
Not far away , Libyan commercial airliners sat motionless on the tarmac . 
Since NATO and US forces imposed a no-fly zone on Libya last March , this once bustling gateway to Tripoli has been barely operational . 
Daw said the airport now received occasional United Nations and Red Cross flights , as well as planes carrying foreign diplomatic delegations .

2011-07-20,"July 20 , 2011 | By Ivan Watson , CNN Libyan rebel fighter wearing his old national flag as a cape flashes the ` victory ' sign as he looks at an airforce fighter jet flying overhead at a checkpoint on the outskirts of the oil town of Ras Lanuf on March 7 . 
The Libyan government in Tripoli estimates the grinding conflict that has been tearing the country apart for the past five months has cost the national economy some $ 50 billion . 
`` The cost is colossal , '' said Abdulhafid Zlitni , planning and finance minister for the Tripoli government . 
In an interview with CNN , Zlitni said the suspension of oil and gas exports had accounted for a huge chunk of the losses . 
`` The income foregone because of the stoppage of the export of oil is something like $ 20 billion , '' he said . 
This has brought an end to what had been a surge in prosperity for the North African country . 
Last year , Libya 's economy was booming , with gross domestic product surging 10.3 % , according to the International Monetary Fund . 
And in a report published February 15 , the IMF 's executive board concluded , `` The outlook for Libya 's economy remains favorable . '' 
But two days later , protests against Col. Moammar Gadhafi 's 41-year rule erupted in the eastern city of Benghazi . 
As protests spread to other cities and towns across the country , the Gadhafi regime embarked on a bloody crackdown . 
Today , the country is split into territories controlled by loyalists and opposition rebels . 
A NATO military alliance is now into the fourth month of a campaign of airstrikes against government targets after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilian lives . 
The civil war has all but shattered ambitious plans to upgrade transport , housing and infrastructure in a country that had long been isolated from the international community . 
`` The main objective was to create capacity for the economy to stand on its feet away from oil and gas production , '' recalled Zlitni somewhat wistfully , as he described a five-year , $ 170 billion plan to modernize Libya . 
In March , the legions of foreign workers who had been contracted to build railroads , airports , apartment buildings and telecommunications networks began fleeing the rapidly escalating conflict by the tens of thousands . 
The exodus included large numbers of engineers , construction and oil workers from China , Turkey , Egypt , and the Philippines , who crossed the western border with Tunisia on foot . 
At the time , many of them told CNN stories of being robbed at gunpoint by Libyan security forces who took their cell phones , laptops and money .

Left behind were mammoth construction projects that still dot the Libyan landscape .

Particularly in the building sectors , the transportation sectors , the communication sectors . '' 
More ominous for the Libyan economy has been the Tripoli government 's growing isolation . 
NATO is enforcing a no-fly zone over Gadhafi-controlled territory as well as a virtual blockade of Libyan ports . 
The sanctions have created huge fuel shortages . 
Long lines of cars now wait at service stations . 
This week , the government in Tripoli announced it was intervening to control rising prices of basic commodities . 
`` In a crisis situation like this traders tend to profit more than they should , and therefore there is an intervention by the ministry of foreign trade for the prices of consumer goods , '' Zlitni said . 
The minister said the government was fixing prices of rice , flour , meat , eggs , sugar and edible oils to prevent hardship among lower-income families . 
`` We subsidize , basically , '' Zlitni said , `` with large amount of funds . '' 
But Zlitni warned it was growing increasingly difficult for the embattled Gadhafi regime to pay for these types of subsidies . 
He pointed out that foreign countries have frozen tens of billions of dollars in Libyan government assets that had been carefully invested overseas in `` treasury bills , bonds , stocks and investments in various international markets , whether in Europe , the USA or Asia . '' 
Zlitni compared Libya 's dwindling government coffers to the edible meat on an animal . 
`` This should n't last long , otherwise we 'll be eating the fat and meat . 
And we 'll very soon arrive to the bones . '' 
Throughout the hour-long interview , Zlitni made no mention of the fact that last month , the U.N. Security Council added his name to a list of high-ranking officials in the Gadhafi regime now facing an international travel ban . 
He did , however , declare Tripoli 's opposition to proposals to hand over frozen Libyan government bank accounts to the opposition Transitional National Council headquartered in Benghazi . 
Last week , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced Washington formally recognized the council in Benghazi as Libya 's legitimate governing authority . 
State department officials said this could potentially give Benghazi access to some $ 30 billion in frozen Libyan funds in the United States . 
`` This is against international rules . 
The international monetary system can not withstand action in this manner , '' Zlitni said . 
`` If you are freezing through United Nations Security Council action funds for any country , then you ca n't confiscate it . 
There are legal obligations of the banks . '' 
But when asked what recourse Tripoli would have if the U.S. government went through with its threat , Zlitni conceded there are few options . 
`` We should file litigation against them , '' he said .

2011-07-21,"LONDON | Thu Jul 21 , 2011 1:05 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Military pressure alone may not end Libya 's war , but neither is diplomacy proving to be the fast track to peace that impatient Western powers had hoped . 
Ineptly deployed , it may even put a brake on the deal-making a resolution will almost certainly require , analysts say . 
Just how slippery the political track has become for the West emerged on Wednesday , when France , a leading nation in the coalition attacking Gaddafi 's forces , said the Libyan leader could remain in the country if he relinquished power . 
The idea floated by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe will be anathema to many in the rebel opposition who insist Gaddafi not only end his 41-year-old rule but also leave the country . 
The notion also looks at odds with a Gaddafi arrest warrant issued by The Hague court for crimes against humanity allegedly committed by state forces against civilian demonstrators . 
Perhaps most starkly of all , Juppe 's remark shows how far Gaddafi 's resilience has diluted Western ambitions five months after the start of an anti-government revolt and four months after NATO began air strikes . 
Then , back on February 24 , Juppe , echoing the aspirations of officials in many Western states , said : `` I hope wholeheartedly Gaddafi is living his last moments as leader . '' 
The more modest the West 's expectations , the better the deal Gaddafi may eventually be able to strike . 
Foreign powers are eager for a rapid end to hostilities , because they want the oil-exporting nation of 6 million to emerge as a stable democracy rather than fall prey to ethnic or tribal conflict , or become a haven for Islamist militants -- both outcomes a prolonged conflict might produce . 
But the remarks by Juppe , the first senior Western official to express the Gaddafi-can-stay option in such a direct manner , will `` give great comfort '' to the leader , said Jon Marks , a veteran Libya watcher and chairman of Cross Border Information , a UK-based consultancy . 
It would encourage the Colonel in a belief that he can widen rifts within the international community by stringing out talks with Western powers on a potential exit strategy , he said . 
Opposition activist and journalist Ashour Shamis said it was impossible to imagine Gaddafi , a proven survivor who ruled for years under sanctions , remaining in Libya in retirement `` keeping quiet and not making trouble . '' 
`` In his mind he is Libya and therefore has the natural right to intervene . 
So this idea of Gaddafi staying in the country undermines the whole project -LRB- or reaching a workable solution -RRB- . '' 
`` It will create more problems than it solves . '' 
Western officials have said they are receiving continual approaches by Libyan officials expressing contradictory messages on how to bring peace to the country . 
Some indicate a willingness to step down and help with transitional elections . 
But on the record , Gaddafi appears defiant . 
Earlier this month he even threatened to take the war to Europe . 
His foreign minister , Abdelati Obeidi , said on Wednesday that the government was not in any discussions about Gaddafi 's potential departure from power . 
As a result of the mixed messages , no one appears sure whether Gaddafi intends to fight in hope of keeping his grip on the territory around Tripoli or seek an exit strategy that guarantees security for himself and his family . 
Gaddafi is under huge pressure from dwindling fuel supplies and a broadening network of diplomatic acceptance of the rebels , notably Washington 's July 15 recognition of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council as Libya 's government . 
`` The colonel 's best hope of survival is for a large-scale fallout between NATO members and a scaling back or cessation of air strikes , '' a briefing by risk analysis firm Maplecroft said . 
`` This , however , is unlikely to occur in the near term . 
As such , the noose continues to tighten around Gaddafi . '' 
But Oliver Miles , a former British ambassador to Libya , said behind-the-scenes contacts had clearly not clinched agreement about Gaddafi 's evident desire to stay in Libya . 
`` There 's no real indication that that difference has been bridged yet . '' 
Some analysts say Gaddafi is not likely to embrace the notion of asylum in a third country , even if the U.N. Security Council voted to give him immunity from prosecution . 
Uppermost in the minds of Gaddafi 's aides , Miles said , was the case of former Liberian President Charles Taylor , who was arrested in March 2006 for crimes committed in Sierra Leone 's 1991-2002 civil war . 
Taylor was in exile in Nigeria from 2003 until March 2006 , when he briefly disappeared before Nigerian police arrested him at a remote border post as he tried to flee into Cameroon . 
`` The version of the Charles Taylor story that seems to be believed in Libya is that he was given assurances of asylum by the Nigerians and they welshed on this and handed him over to the court , '' Miles said . 
`` That must be in anyone 's mind if they are thinking in terms of asylum in Africa . ''

2011-07-22,"TRIPOLI , Libya | Fri Jul 22 , 2011 6:37 pm EDT TRIPOLI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- Libyan representatives are ready to hold more talks with the United States and with rebels hoping to push Muammar Gaddafi from power , a Libyan government spokesman said , but Gaddafi will not bow to demands he leave power . 
Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said that senior Libyan officials had a `` productive dialogue ' with U.S. counterparts last week in a rare meeting that followed the Obama administration 's recognition of the rebel government that hopes to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . 
`` We believe other meetings in the future ... will help solve Libyan problems , '' Ibrahim told reporters in Tripoli on Friday . 
`` We are willing to talk to the Americans more . '' 
As Gaddafi clings to power despite five months of civil conflict and a lengthening NATO bombing campaign , the West is increasingly hoping for a negotiated settlement to the Libyan conflict . 
While the United States , NATO 's dominant military power , is hoping that talks can gain traction , it along with the rebels that now control roughly half of Libya insists Gaddafi must go . 
Ibrahim said Libyan officials but not Gaddafi himself would be willing to hold further meetings with rebels . 
But such talks will only take place on the government 's terms , he said , as it urges them to put down their arms and rejoin the Gaddafi camp . 
`` Nations do not negotiate with armed gangs , '' Ibrahim said . 
Gaddafi is urging Libyans , however , to persuade rebels to disarm and to fight them if they do n't . 
The comments came as the Libya reported a NATO airstrike near the eastern oil hub of Brega , the scene of recent fighting , which the government said killed six guards at a water pipeline plant . 
The report could not be immediately verified . 
As Western nations intensify diplomatic efforts to foster an exit from the conflict , a European diplomat said that a U.N. envoy will seek to persuade warring parties in Libya to accept a plan that envisages a ceasefire and a power-sharing government , but with no role for Gaddafi . 
The diplomat said the informal proposals would be canvassed by the special U.N. envoy to Libya , Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who has met both government and rebels several times . 
Khatib , a Jordanian senator , told Reuters in Amman he hoped both sides would accept his ideas . 
`` The U.N. is exerting very serious efforts to create a political process that has two pillars ; one is an agreement on a ceasefire and simultaneously an agreement on setting up a mechanism to manage the transitional period , '' he said . 
He did not go into the details of that mechanism . 
Poorly armed rebels seem unlikely on the cusp of the Islamic holy month to quickly unseat Gaddafi , who came to power himself as a young revolutionary influenced by Egypt 's Gamal Abdel-Nasser . 
The rebels declared advances this week but they also suffered losses near their stronghold of Misrata and in fighting for Brega . 
On Thursday rebels said minefields slowed their advance on Brega -- which they had earlier claimed to have all but captured -- but that they had pushed closer to Zlitan , on the Mediterranean coast 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . 
A rebel spokesman near Zlitan called urgently for help for people in nearby Souk al-Thulatha who joined the rebels but were now besieged by government forces . 
`` This is very dangerous for the course of the revolution , '' he wrote in an online posting . 
Gaddafi has stepped up his defiant rhetoric amid persistent reports of talks . 
Pro-government rallies are being shown almost daily on state television , perhaps a reminder to outsiders that he can still command considerable support . 
On Friday , thousands of people gathered near Tripoli 's historic center to watch the unveiling of a massive likeness of the longtime leader . 
State television said Gaddafi would make another speech on Saturday , this time addressed to Egyptians on the anniversary of their revolution -- not this year 's , which toppled President Hosni Mubarak , but pan-Arabist Nasser 's in 1959 . 
Despite facing a rebel challenge and ostracized by much of the international community , the government remained potent , Ibrahim said . 
`` NATO , you are losing , you will lose , '' he said . 
`` The armed gangs in the western mountains and the east part of the country , you have no future -LRB- in the country -RRB- . 
Ibrahim also denied a report from rebel foreign spokesman Ali Essawi that Mansour Daw , a key aide to Gaddafi , had been wounded in a rebel rocket attack on a meeting of Gaddafi 's inner circle in Tripoli on Thursday . 
Ibrahim said there had been an explosion caused by a kitchen gas cylinder . 
Hopes for a negotiated settlement are growing as Europe and the United States grapple with fiscal crises at home . 
This week , France said for the first time that Gaddafi could stay in Libya as long as he gives up power . 
But there is little evidence in Libya that either side is ready to make serious concessions . 
`` The first principle for Libyans is that Gaddafi should step down , and announce this and make this very clear . 
After that , we can talk about details , '' Essawi told reporters in Rome . 
`` Negotiations will be only on the departure of Gaddafi . 
We will not negotiate on his staying in Libya or ruling the Libyans . '' 
Ibrahim meanwhile reiterated that Gaddafi would not leave his position nor leave Libya on demands from rebels or from Complicating Gaddafi 's situation is the fact that the world court in The Hague which seeks his arrest over crimes against humanity allegedly committed by his forces , he added . 
As the war in Libya drags on , the U.S. military is weighing options that may deepen its involvement in the conflict and its alliance with the rebels . 
A U.S. official told Reuters on Friday that the United States is considering a NATO request to send more Predator drones to Libya , as well as other surveillance aircraft . 
It has also reopened a debate over arming the rebels , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .

2011-07-23,"TRIPOLI , Libya | Sat Jul 23 , 2011 10:52 am EDT TRIPOLI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya is ready to hold more talks with the United States and with rebels trying to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi , but the Libyan leader will not bow to demands he quit , a government spokesman said . 
Moussa Ibrahim said Libyan officials had a `` productive dialogue '' with U.S. counterparts last week in a rare meeting that followed American recognition of the rebel government that hopes to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . 
`` Other meetings in the future ... will help solve Libyan problems , '' the spokesman told reporters in Tripoli late on Friday . 
`` We are willing to talk to the Americans more . '' 
He said Gaddafi would not leave his position nor Libya . 
Hours later NATO planes bombed targets in the capital , causing damage and casualties , Libyan state television said , without giving details . 
NATO said it had hit a `` command and control node . '' 
A Reuters witness heard at least six blasts early on Saturday , the largest to hit the capital in several weeks , four of them shaking the hotel hosting international media . 
Rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said Gaddafi must agree publicly to stand down before any talks could begin . 
`` There are no negotiations with this regime unless he declares his departure and that he is stepping down , he and his sons , from power , '' he said in a weekly statement to Libyans broadcast on rebel-run television . 
As Gaddafi clings to power despite five months of civil war and a NATO bombing campaign authorized by a U.N. resolution , the West is increasingly hoping for a negotiated settlement . 
But the United States also says Gaddafi must go . 
Ibrahim said Libyan officials - but not Gaddafi himself - would be willing to hold further meetings with rebels , who now control roughly half of Libya , only on the government 's terms . 
`` Nations do not negotiate with armed gangs , '' he said . 
Gaddafi is urging Libyans to persuade rebels to disarm and rejoin the loyal fold -- and to fight them if they do n't . 
His comments came as Libya reported a NATO airstrike near the eastern oil hub of Brega , the scene of recent fighting , which the government said killed six guards at a water plant . 
NATO said the strike targeted a `` military storage facility '' rather than the water pipeline plant . 
As Western nations intensify diplomatic efforts , a European diplomat said a U.N. envoy would seek to persuade the warring parties to accept a plan that envisages a ceasefire and a power-sharing government , but with no role for Gaddafi . 
The diplomat said the informal proposals would be canvassed by the special U.N. envoy to Libya , Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who has met both government and rebels several times . 
Jalil , who heads the rebels ' Transitional National Council that many Western nations now recognize as the Libyan authority , told Reuters on Saturday that Khatib 's plan for power-sharing could be discussed as long as Gaddafi himself was out . 
`` Any diplomatic solutions are acceptable if they include this main condition , '' he said . 
A rebel spokesman told Reuters that Khatib would come to their eastern stronghold of Benghazi early next week .

They declared advances this week but they also suffered losses near their enclave of Misrata and in fighting for Brega .

Let the leaders of both factions stand down and then talk to each other . 
What kind of idiot says they will negotiate with the opposing faction as soon as they leave power ? 
`` As Gaddafi clings to power despite five months of civil war and a NATO bombing campaign authorized by a U.N. resolution , the West is increasingly hoping for a negotiated settlement ... But the United States also says Gaddafi must go . '' 
The civil war was created out of whole cloth by NATO 's intervention , and the UN resolution authorised a no-fly zone , which is a far different thing from a bombing campaign . 
As for a negotiated settlement , see above . 
What kind of an idiot ... Well , every schoolyard bragger\/bully wants to `` talk '' once he is finally getting his butt whipped . 
Most of the time it 's a little late for that . 
Everybody has willing to `` talk '' to Moammar for the past 40 years . 
All he ever did was rant and rave and thumb his nose . 
Now , the time for `` talking '' has passed . 
This is not about `` fair '' . 
The `` negotiations '' that will take place when Moammar -LRB- perhaps -RRB- announces he will step down only concern the method and manner of his exile and imprisonment and issues such as the immunity of his family from prosecution . 
Of course , he can always lead his devotees to utter destruction , then put a pistol in his mouth like Hitler . 
Or , he can `` negotiate '' . 
This is all about powers-that-be who have had completely enough of Moammar and have decided , irrevocably , to relegate him to history . 
Any `` idiocy '' would be in the assumption that the dialog surrounding this conflict is ever likely to be some kind of fair and open discussion . 
It 's not a debate in sociology class , it 's the end -LRB- finally -RRB- of Moammar . 
Whether or not that 's nice , or fair , or whether the above mentioned powers-that-be are being less than impartial in their application of justice is entirely irrelevant .

2011-07-24,"By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan rebel fighters attend the funeral of comrades killed during clashes with loyalist troops in the city of Benghazi on July 22 . 
NEW : Rebel forces fight to hold on to village of Qawalish Germany to lend money for `` civilian and humanitarian purposes '' Statement : The money ultimately will be repaid from unfrozen assets Germany previously announced a smaller loan of $ 10 million -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Germany announced Sunday it has agreed to lend 100 million euros -LRB- $ 144 million -RRB- to the rebels in Libya for `` civilian and humanitarian purposes '' despite staying out of NATO 's bombing campaign against Libyan government forces . 
Germany had previously announced a loan of $ 10 million -LRB- 7 million euros -RRB- for humanitarian aid to the Transitional National Council , the rebel movement that is battling to unseat longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi . 
`` Because of Colonel Gadhafi 's war against his own people , the situation in Libya is very difficult , '' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement announcing the loan . 
`` There is a major lack of funds to build infrastructure , as well as a shortage of needed goods , ranging from medical supplies to food . '' 
Germany has not participated in the NATO-led military effort in Libya and abstained from the U.N. Security Council vote that authorized military action to protect civilians from Gadhafi 's forces . 
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in June that her country shares the hope `` that this NATO mission is successful . '' 
Merkel also said Germany was supporting the NATO mission by providing increased resources to the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan , freeing other nations to contribute to the Libyan campaign . 
Germany has recognized the rebels as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people and established a liaison office with the opposition in Benghazi in May . 
Berlin indicated Sunday that the loan will eventually be repaid by the Transitional National Council , using frozen assets from the Gadhafi regime . 
The statement indicated the reimbursement would happen `` when the U.N. Security Council unfreezes the assets for a legitimate Libyan government . '' 
By agreeing to the loan , Germany added itself to a growing number of nations , including Turkey and Qatar , that have announced plans to hand over millions of dollars in frozen Gadhafi assets to the rebel council in Benghazi . 
In an interview with CNN last week , the finance minister for the internationally isolated Libyan government in Tripoli warned that the proposed reallocation of frozen funds would violate international law . 
`` The international monetary system can not withstand action in this manner , '' said Abdulhafid Zlitni . 
`` If you are freezing , through United Nations Security Council action , funds for any country , then you ca n't confiscate it . 
There are legal obligations of the banks . '' 
Also on Sunday , rebel forces fought to hold on to Qawalish , a key Libyan village along a major north-south route . 
Rebel fighter Talha Jwaili told CNN that Gadhafi forces advanced from nearby Al-Asaba using heavy machinery . 
The rebels called in a large rebel force from Zintan , a city 25 miles -LRB- 40 kilometers -RRB- away , and `` managed to repel the Gadhafi forces after a fierce fight that lasted almost four hours , '' Jwaili said . 
One person died in the fighting , Jwaili said -- his 16-year-old cousin , Youssef Jwaili , son of the Zintan military commander . 
Several others were injured , Jwaili said . 
State TV , meanwhile , offered a different version of events . 
It reported `` armed gangs and the colonialist crusader alliance '' attacked a march of Libyan tribes at the entrance of Qawalish . 
It broadcast video of a convoy of civilian vehicles with passengers waving green government flags . 
It also showed video of people being treated at a hospital . 
In a speech last week , Gadhafi called on his supporters to march -- unarmed -- to reclaim rebel-controlled cities and towns . 
`` A million should march to Benghazi and liberate it from the traitors without any weapons , '' the strongman said . 
`` Even without weapons , we can cleanse the western mountains by the march of men and women . ''

2011-07-25,"ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- An Istanbul court sentenced on Monday the assassin of Armenian journalist Hrant Dink to nearly 23 years in prison .

ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Syrian opposition factions meeting in Istanbul on Saturday formed a broad-based council in the hope of creating a government-in-waiting to fill a void if street protests succeed in toppling President Bashar al-Assad . 
Meeting a day after the biggest protests so far in Syria , the result was probably the minimum the opposition could have hoped for if they were to give heart to protesters risking their lives demanding an end to 41 years of Assad family rule . 
ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Western powers and Arab states meeting in Istanbul on Friday will seek a political solution to end the civil war in Libya , amid conflicting signals over whether Muammar Gaddafi intends to fight on or surrender power . 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the EU 's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton are among more than a dozen ministers attending the Libyan contact group meeting , its fourth since an emergency summit in London in March . 
ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- A meeting of Syrian opposition in Istanbul ended on Wednesday with a call for the army to protect its people and side with the protesters against President Bashar al-Assad 's government . 
Attended largely by exiled dissidents , the gathering will be followed by another in Istanbul on Saturday , which the organisers hope to twin through video-link with a `` National Salvation '' conference planned by opposition in Damascus . 
BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Turkey pledged $ 200 million in aid for Libya 's rebel Transitional National Council and said it was time for leader Muammar Gaddafi to leave Libya . 
Muslim Turkey , a rising power in the Middle East , had close economic ties with Gaddafi 's Libya but has distanced itself from the Libyan leader since a rebellion broke out against his rule . 
ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Irish pro-Palestinian activists accused Israel on Thursday of sabotaging their boat while it was docked in Turkey to stop it joining an international flotilla bound for the Palestinian enclave of Gaza . 
The crew of the MV Saoirse realized there was something wrong with the propeller shaft when they took the vessel for refueling at Gocek on Turkey 's southwest coast on Monday . 
Activists said a marine engineer who inspected the damaged boat in dry dock declared that it had been sabotaged . 
ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Having handed Tayyip Erdogan his third term as prime minister , the question for many Turks is whether his next stop will be the presidency . 
For the past decade Erdogan has dominated the political landscape in Turkey , a largely Muslim nation of 74 million that he has led to the gates of the European Union by opening negotiations for membership in 2005 . 
ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Turkish politicians made their last campaign rounds on Saturday on the eve of an election that is expected to see Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan win a third term and could give him a mandate to rewrite the constitution . 
Often cited as a Muslim nation with a working democracy , Turkey has become regarded as model for people in North Africa and Middle East living through the `` Arab Spring . ''

2011-07-25,"BENGHAZI | Mon Jul 25 , 2011 6:39 pm EDT BENGHAZI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.N. envoy to Libya and the Benghazi-based rebel council discussed on Monday ideas for ending the civil war , but said a firm initiative had yet to take shape . 
With a diplomatic push to end the conflict gathering steam , Abdul Elah al-Khatib told Reuters after the meeting that he would head to Tripoli on Tuesday to canvass government views . 
`` We did not put a plan in front of them . 
We discussed the views and ideas on how we can trigger a political process ... to achieve a political solution , '' he said . 
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is clinging to power despite a four-month-old NATO air campaign and five months of fighting with rebels who have seized large swathes of the oil-rich North African country . 
NATO has continued to hammer Gaddafi 's forces around Libya , striking twice in central Tripoli on Monday , and Britain has said there would be no let-up during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in August . 
But hopes have grown for a negotiated end to a war that has dragged on longer than many initially expected . 
Speaking to Reuters after meeting Khatib , senior rebel official Mahmoud Jibreel said he had made it clear that the rebels would not accept any initiative that did not involve the removal of Gaddafi from power as a first step to peace . 
That appears to be a tacit rejection of U.N. ideas floated informally by a diplomat last week , which envisaged a ceasefire followed by a power-sharing government without Gaddafi . 
Khatib , a Jordanian politician , has said his ideas involve an agreement on a ceasefire and , simultaneously , on setting up a mechanism to manage the transitional period . 
He gave no details . 
`` So far , there is no initiative . 
He is trying to propose some general ideas , see what is acceptable and what is not acceptable , and on the basis of that he can propose an initiative , '' Jibreel said . 
`` We are not committed to anything unless we have something written . '' 
Khatib 's visit comes a day after Gaddafi 's Foreign Minister , Abdelati Obeidi , ended three days of talks in regional power Egypt to seek a negotiated end to the war . 
Libya 's government has said its representatives are ready to hold more talks with the United States and the rebels , but that Gaddafi himself will not negotiate and will not quit . 
Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said on Friday senior Libyan officials had a `` productive dialogue '' with U.S. counterparts earlier this month in a rare meeting that followed U.S. recognition of the rebel government . 
Complicating Gaddafi 's situation is the fact that the world court in The Hague is seeking his arrest for crimes against humanity allegedly committed by his forces . 
This makes it difficult for him to find refuge outside the country . 
Hopes for a negotiated settlement have grown , however , since France said for the first time last week that Gaddafi could stay in Libya as long as he gives up power . 
The rebel leaders have given conflicting signals in recent weeks over whether they would allow Gaddafi and his family to stay in Libya as part of a deal , providing he gave up power . 
In the latest comment on the issue , opposition leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told the Wall Street Journal that it would be acceptable . 
`` Gaddafi can stay in Libya but it will have conditions , '' he said . 
`` We will decide where he stays and who watches him . 
The same conditions will apply to his family . '' 
The poorly armed rebels seem unlikely to quickly unseat Gaddafi . 
Rebels announced they had almost taken the oil town of Brega , but later said that minefields had slowed their advance . 
Libyan state TV showed images of empty streets and oil storage facilities in Brega that it said were filmed on Monday . 
Rebels fighting on a western front near Misrata say they have pushed closer to Zlitan , on the Mediterranean coast 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . 
But the front near Zlitan was relatively quiet on Monday . 
Twenty casualties were taken to hospital in Misrata and to a field hospital , but doctors said most had only light wounds . 
Tripoli-based journalists were taken to Zlitan to see what officials said were some food warehouses and a clinic that were hit by NATO forces . 
The officials said seven bodies had been recovered from what they said was the destroyed clinic , where blankets and oxygen tanks but no beds could be seen . 
Britain said its warplanes near Zlitan hit four buildings on Saturday , which NATO surveillance had identified as command and control centers , staging posts and an ammunition stockpile . 
`` We have no evidence suggesting that these allegations are founded , '' a NATO official told Reuters on Monday when asked about the casualty claim . 
Rebels near Zlitan said in an online posting that the facilities had once served civilian uses -- two medical centers , a food store and a public bath -- but had been turned into military bases by Gaddafi forces . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
UN is so useless and has been manipulated . 
The whole fiasco is to GRAB oil and Exploit libya . 
The original intentions were abandoned and now all the want is a puppet regime in Libya . 
SHAME SHAME on Europe and USA for manipualting the UN and AFRICA slept again and the colonization has returned . 
China and Russia are just deal darling - they could have reversed this madness of imposing the rebels on Libya and on Africa . 
Africa too could have done more to say NO. . 
Those rebels are just a total DISGRACE to Africa and Quater , Turkey betrayed the cause . 
The Arab league is a western club . 
deserves no respect from anyone .

2011-07-25,"LONDON\/DUBAI | Mon Jul 25 , 2011 10:51 am EDT LONDON\/DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey has delivered its first cargo of fuel to aid east Libya as part of multi-million dollar free oil supply deal with the cash-strapped rebel government aimed at easing shortages , industry sources told Reuters . 
Libya 's civil war has damaged oil infrastructure and severely hampered the rebel government 's ability to produce and sell oil , increasing its reliance on foreign aid to pay for imports of refined products . 
Turkish Petroleum International Company -LRB- TPIC -RRB- , a subsidiary of Turkey 's state-owned oil and gas exploration company Turkiye Petrolleri -LRB- TPAO -RRB- , has shipped two fuel cargoes worth at least $ 10 million , an industry source familiar with the deal said . 
The first tanker , the Sentosa Island , arrived in Benghazi late last week , carrying about 5,000 tonnes of diesel , trade sources said . 
A second cargo , also carrying around 5,000 tonnes of diesel from Turkey was being delivered , the source said . 
Regular fuel supplies such as gasoline for cars and diesel used for power plants are vital to the rebels to win the war and retain popular support in a country long-accustomed to subsidised energy . 
A second industry source said the Turkish government was seeking to line up more suppliers and that he expected one or two more cargoes to be sent . 
`` The Turks are pushing for more supplies , '' he said . 
The supply deal is a sign of closer ties between Benghazi and Ankara , which recognized the rebel Transitional National Council earlier this month and pledged $ 200 million in aid . 
It was not clear whether funding for these fuel deliveries was included in this sum , but the trade sources said that the fuel was being delivered for humanitarian reasons , with no payment expected . 
A spokesman at the Turkish foreign ministry could not immediately be reached for comment . 
`` TPIC is considering sending some more fuel on top of these two cargoes . 
But after that , whether or not these shipments will continue will be up to the Turkish government , '' the first source said . 
FUEL LIFELINE Oil firm Vitol has until now been the rebels ' main trading partner and has regularly shipped cargoes of oil products , but the oil minister said last month they have had to request payment extensions . 
Qatar has also supplied fuel to the rebel government . 
`` It 's not that the Vitol deal is insufficient -- this is free , '' said a Libyan oil industry source , working with the rebels . 
Other oil traders active in the Mediterranean told Reuters they were interested in supplying Libya but that banks were still blocking payments to the TNC due to sanctions . 
An oil ministry source said last week that the rebels were looking for an alternative supplier and that at least one other oil firm said it was in talks with them in an early sign that the Libyan oil trade may be picking up . 
Exact import requirements are unclear , but an industry source with knowledge of the Libyan market said they were around 50,000 tonnes a week . 
West Libya is also suffering from fuel shortages as international sanctions and NATO cargo interceptions have deterred traders from delivering via tankers . 
Instead , smugglers are importing fuels overland from Algeria and Tunisia .

2011-07-26,"It 's getting harder and harder to believe there 'll eventually be a resolution to Libya 's civil war that will allow anyone to claim Moammar Gadhafi lost to rebel forces or was humbled by members of the NATO-led coalition waging air strikes against him . 
Indeed , it 's becoming increasingly clear as the weeks rush by that battle-weary European partners in the intervention force are keener to find ways of ending the conflict and pull forces back home than they are to obtain their initial objectives of seeing Gadhafi deposed and forced abroad . 
The upshot is the sound of diplomatic throats being cleared ever louder to prepare public opinion for the now-probable scenario of the operation ending without Gadhafi having budged much . 
As Tony Karon 's July 20 post noted , U.S. officials came away from recent meetings in Tunisia with Gaddafi representatives repeating demands that the colonel must go as a part of any resolution to the conflict . 
Yet even then it was becoming evident that what go ultimately entails may not meet the definition rebels have long advanced : of Gadhafi being forcefully driven from power , arrested , and handed over to the U.N. tribunal wanting to try him for crimes against humanity . 
On July 20 , French Foreign Minister Alain Jupp told French TV channel LCI that one of the hypotheses that 's envisioned is , indeed , that -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- stays in Libya on the condition he very clearly leaves Libyan political life . 
That considerably watered down position on the criteria to end the conflict was then repeated on July 25 by British Foreign Secretary William Hague . 
While remaining adamant that Gadhafi must leave power , Hague left the Libyan leader 's fate beyond that open to question . 
`` Obviously him leaving Libya itself would be the best way of showing the Libyan people that they no longer have to live in fear of Gadhafi , Hague said Monday , prior to his meeting with Jupp in London . 
`` But as I have said all along , this is ultimately a question for Libyans to determine . ''

Why do you think twice before supporting them ? 
Because they are not rich and cant give you hefty contracts ?

2011-07-26,"Libya 's Zlitan increasingly in rebel , NATO sights By Ivan Watson and Jomana Karadsheh , CNN Libyan fire fighters survey the remains of a food storage building damaged during a NATO airstrike in Zlitan , Libya , on July 25 . 
NEW : NATO rejects claims it hit non-military targets near the coastal city of Zlitan Monday NATO airstrikes have pounded the city , about 40 km west of rebel-held Misrata , for a week `` It 's continuous bombing , morning day and night , '' one resident says Government minders took reporters to Zlitan Monday to view the damage Zlitan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Firefighters battled a blaze caused by NATO airstrikes at a food-storage complex Monday in Zlitan , increasingly a front-line city in the conflict between Libyan government troops and rebels fighting to oust longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi . 
The firefighters doused burning sacks of flour with water after bombs punctured the high roofs of three facilities packed with flour , rice and cooking oil in Zlitan , on the Libyan coast east of Tripoli . 
An unexploded bomb lay buried in the concrete floor of one of the buildings , beneath a hole in the ceiling where sunlight streamed through . 
Zlitan is about 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- west of the opposition-held port city of Misrata , and the front line between the rebels and pro-regime forces is somewhere in between the two cities . 
Smoke rising on the horizon and the rumble of artillery in the east suggested that by Monday , the fighting had moved closer to the city limits . 
`` It 's continuous bombing , morning day and night , '' said Fathi Amar , who stood armed with a radio and camouflage uniform at the entrance to the burning storage center . 
No one was hurt in Monday 's attack , Amar said . 
But he said five guards had been killed in another bombing run that struck the agricultural police center next door on Saturday , leaving little more than a heap of rubble . 
And another attack two days ago demolished what he described as a military base several hundred yards up the road , killing at least two people , he said . 
Libya ' Zlitan in rebel , NATO sights Moments after a busload of international journalists arrived , a handful of Libyan men ran up before television cameras chanting the oft-repeated pro-regime slogan `` Allah , Moammar , Libya , nothing else ! '' 
When Libyan government minders last brought CNN to Zlitan about a week and a half ago , it was to see a large pro-Gadhafi rally in the city 's main square . 
Crowds of Libyans waved green government flags , fired guns in the air , and fervently pledged their loyalty to their embattled leader . 
But the scene was dramatically different Monday , as fire trucks and ambulances regularly raced through the city 's largely deserted streets . 
Many shops appeared to be closed , and the ominous rumble of warplanes could be heard overhead periodically . 
The NATO alliance says it has been hitting targets it describes as tanks , `` military storage facilities '' and artillery pieces in the vicinity of Zlitan on a daily basis for the past week . 
Officials from the embattled Gadhafi government also say the air strikes have intensified in frequency . 
`` People here call NATO the crazy one which lost its sanity , '' said Ramadan Mohamad Ramadan , an official from the local city government . 
`` It is waging wide-scale war on the people . 
They are destroying everything . '' 
Ramadan was standing in front of the rubble of a health clinic that he said had been demolished by a pre-dawn attack on Monday . 
Several bulldozers dug through wreckage strewn with medical supplies , including syringes , medication and even a microscope . 
Government officials said they were looking for the bodies of three people believed to be buried underneath , and said the bodies of eight people had been pulled out earlier in the day . 
Journalists did not see any evidence of dead or wounded at the site . 
Barely 100 yards away , however , drivers had parked a number of pick-up trucks under the cover of olive trees . 
Some of the vehicles were smeared with mud and the equipment in their chassis covered with branches -- an apparent camouflage tactic seen used by both loyalist and rebel fighters around Libya . 
Uniformed troops could also be seen resting in the shade of the orchard . 
Responding to the Libyan government 's claims to journalists that a health clinic and food-storage facility had been hit , NATO had found no evidence to support the allegations , a NATO representative said . 
NATO forces had hit a number of targets near Zlitan that were `` military in nature '' Monday , the representative said . 
`` These targets were a command and control node and a vehicle storage facility that contained military vehicles . 
`` This is not the first time that such allegations have been made and as is the case with all NATO strikes a thorough damage assessment is conducted afterwards . 
As always great care is taken to minimize the risk of civilian casualties . 
`` We are always concerned by any reports of civilian casualties , take them seriously and the appropriate analysis will be conducted to ascertain the legitimacy , or otherwise , of these allegations . '' 
In the afternoon , government minders brought journalists to the ruins of a mosque and school located in an all-but-deserted residential neighborhood several kilometers to the east of Zlitan 's city center . 
An air attack clearly destroyed the compound , but there were conflicting reports from government minders regarding which week the strike took place . 
As another small group of pro-regime supporters began chanting at the ruins of the school , the thud of big guns continued to rumble . 
One of the minders said NATO warships in the Mediterranean Sea were shelling loyalist positions , but it was impossible for CNN to confirm whether the fire was incoming or outgoing . 
Two vehicles loaded with women , children and belongings drove past the shattered buildings , heading west -- away from the fighting . 
Suddenly , the unmistakable cloud from an air strike mushroomed up several miles away to the east . 
A four-door sedan , caked with mud and carrying several men wearing camouflage and carrying Kalashnikov rifles , drove past , also headed away from the direction of the front lines as the cloud from a second apparent air strike billowed in the distance . 
`` Come on , let 's go , '' the minders repeated . 
`` We have to go , they could bomb us here any time , '' they said , some of them visibly nervous . 
Monday 's government tour of Zlitan was over , but the fighting there appeared to have barely begun .

2011-07-26,"TRIPOLI | Tue Jul 26 , 2011 2:51 pm BST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Efforts to find a deal to end the civil war in Libya intensified on Tuesday , with a U.N. special envoy heading for Tripoli and Western powers signalling that Muammar Gaddafi could stay in the country if he gives up power . 
U.N. envoy Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who visited the rebels in Benghazi on Monday , is looking for a `` political process '' that will end a war that has failed to dislodge Gaddafi despite months of rebel attacks backed by NATO bombing raids . 
France and other Western members of the anti-Gaddafi coalition have signalled that the Libyan leader could stay in the country provided he and his circle agree to step down . 
A rebel leader this week appeared to endorse this view , which would mark a major shift in policy as previous demands have insisted that Gaddafi must leave the country . 
Deadlines are approaching for the NATO-led alliance , whose mandate for military action expires on September 27 . 
Hopes have also been expressed that some agreement could be reached before the holy month of Ramadan begins at the start of August . 
Britain and France , two of the main backers of the campaign to end Gaddafi 's four decades in charge of the North African oil-producing nation , held talks in London at which they called once more for Gaddafi to leave power . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague and his French counterpart Alain Juppe also said that it was up to the Libyan people to decide their own future . 
British officials said there had been no change of policy direction , but the comments were interpreted as tacit backing for the proposal that Gaddafi can remain in Libya after quitting . 
`` Gaddafi must leave power , '' Hague told reporters on Monday evening . 
`` The best way of showing the Libyan people they need no longer be in fear of Gaddafi would be for him to leave Libya . 
`` So that very much remains our position , but it 's also very clear that whatever is settled is a settlement which the Libyan people are happy with . 
It 's for them to determine their future , not for those outside to try to lay down that future . '' 
Juppe , who has already endorsed the idea of Gaddafi remaining in Libya after leaving power , added : `` As far as we are concerned , Gaddafi should renounce any kind of power in Libya and he must commit himself to not play any kind of role . '' 
`` Gaddafi is going to have to abandon power and then it will be for the Libyan people to decide what their future will be , '' Juppe said . 
Gaddafi has supported talks with the rebels and with the West . 
But while he has made clear he backs the idea of his remaining in Libya , he has shown no sign in public of agreeing to the other part of the deal -- stepping down from power . 
While rebel forces have been unable to move decisively against Gaddafi , they have accused neighbouring Algeria of bolstering his troops by turning a blind eye to an arms shipment . 
Algeria denied it had allowed the weapons to be offloaded at an Algerian port . 
In his talks with the Benghazi-based rebel leadership council , Khatib , the U.N. envoy , discussed ideas for ending the war but said a firm initiative had yet to take shape . 
With a diplomatic push to end the conflict gathering steam , Khatib told Reuters he would canvass government views in Tripoli on Tuesday . 
`` We did not put a plan in front of them . 
We discussed the views and ideas on how we can trigger a political process ... to achieve a political solution , '' he said . 
Libyan officials said they expected the Tripoli talks , with senior Gaddafi aides , would cover peace negotiations . 
But they also wanted to focus on civilian casualties and a desire to urge NATO to stop its air strikes . 
NATO has continued to hammer Gaddafi forces around Libya , striking twice in central Tripoli on Monday , and Britain has said there would be no let-up during Ramadan . 
But hopes have grown for a negotiated end to a war that has dragged on longer than many initially expected . 
Speaking to Reuters after meeting Khatib , senior rebel official Mahmoud Jibril said he had underlined that the rebels would not accept any initiative that did not involve the removal of Gaddafi from power as a first step to peace . 
Khatib , a senior Jordanian politician , has said his ideas involve an agreement on a cease-fire and , simultaneously , on setting up a mechanism to manage the transitional period . 
He has not given details . 
`` So far , there is no initiative . 
He is trying to propose some general ideas , see what is acceptable and what is not acceptable , and on the basis of that he can propose an initiative , '' Jibreel said . 
The rebel leaders have given conflicting signals in recent weeks over whether they would allow Gaddafi and his family to stay in Libya as part of a deal , providing he gave up power . 
In the latest comment on the issue , opposition leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told the Wall Street Journal that it would be acceptable . 
`` Gaddafi can stay in Libya but it will have conditions , '' he said . 
`` We will decide where he stays and who watches him . 
The same conditions will apply to his family . '' 
The poorly armed rebels seem unlikely to quickly unseat Gaddafi . 
Rebels announced they had almost taken the oil town of Brega , but later said that minefields had slowed their advance . 
While rebels in the east received a boost this week when Turkey delivered its first cargo of fuel under a multi-million dollar supply deal , a government rocket attack has cut fuel supplies in the frontline western town of Misrata . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
He has fought the rebels and NATO to a standstill . 
He has effectively won . 
NATO will , in a few months , make some kind of excuse for leaving Libya , and then Gaddafi 's army will move in decisively on the rebels and finish them off . 
Thousands will be executed and Gaddafi will go down in history as the man who beat us all .

2011-07-27,"There was optimism recently from regime insiders in Tripoli that a deal was in the works British move seen as escalation against Gadhafi Libya insists that a cease-fire must come first Rebels and their Western allies say Gadhafi must go Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain 's decision to expel Moammar Gadhafi 's diplomats from London ensures that the bloody test of wills in Libya will grind on for weeks , if not months to come . 
Barely 15 days ago , there was optimism from regime insiders here in Tripoli that a deal was in the works to resolve the five-month conflict . 
Perhaps this was because the Muslim holy month of Ramadan was fast approaching , and with it , an anticipated slow-down in fighting on the front-lines . 
Also , the regime was engaged in talks on multiple fronts with its European , American , and Libyan opponents . 
Developments over the last two weeks appear to have killed those hopes . 
First , the United States joined the growing list of countries officially declaring the rebel council based in Benghazi the `` legitimate governing authority for Libya . '' 
A day after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made the announcement in Istanbul , Turkey , the message was personally delivered during a round of secret talks in Tunisia . 
The Americans said they had one message for the Libyans , `` Gadhafi must go . '' 
At roughly the same time , the Benghazi-based rebels mounted an attack on the eastern front , against the long-contested oil town of al-Brega . 
Gadhafi 's main spokesman accused the NATO military alliance of assisting rebels in the assault . 
He also drew a rhetorical line in the sand around al-Brega , declaring dramatically , `` We will kill , we will die for oil . 
You come to get our oil , we will destroy you . '' 
Libya 's Zlitan in rebel , NATO sights The rebels admit hundreds of their fighters were killed and wounded during a week of fighting around al-Brega , which Ibrahim grandiloquently re-branded `` Libya 's Stalingrad . '' 
Meanwhile , the Tripoli regime has been staging large rallies in support of its embattled leader . 
Enthusiastic , flag-waving crowds thronged the central squares of different regime-controlled towns and cities . 
Partisans swore allegiance to Gadhafi and defiantly fired volleys of gunfire in the air . 
State TV provided blanket coverage of the events , labeling them `` million man marches . '' 
The size of the rallies has been the subject of heated debate between foreign journalists and government officials . 
But there is no question that Tripoli has been shoring up popular support for the man who has ruled this country for more than 40 years . 
Government officials argue that the rallies prove Gadhafi is the democratic choice of the Libyan people , a position that the rebels have fought and bled to refute . 
Therein lies the main sticking point . 
The regime insists cease-fire first , then talks , while also adding that Gadhafi 's position as `` Brother Leader '' is non-negotiable . 
Benghazi and NATO say no talks until Gadhafi goes . 
In recent days , both the rebels and officials in Paris , London and Washington softened their demands . 
They indicated one possible way out of the stalemate could include Gadhafi remaining in Libya , rather than going into exile . 
But Wednesday 's announcement by Britain 's top diplomat marked yet another escalation against Gadhafi and his cohorts . 
William Hague announced he would hand over Tripoli 's embassy -- as well as some of its frozen funds -- to the rebels in Benghazi . 
Gadhafi has never been this internationally isolated , even in the dark days of the eighties when Ronald Reagan famously labeled him `` mad dog of the middle east . '' 
Turkey and even Germany , which abstained from the U.N. resolution authorizing the NATO operation in Libya , have both pledged to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars worth of regime assets to the rebels . 
Even tiny Malta , long described as the `` gateway to Libya , '' has all but broken with the Tripoli regime . 
This week , the United Nations special envoy to Libya seemed to kill all hope for peace . 
After yet another round of shuttle diplomacy between the rebels and the regime , Abdul Ilah al-Khatib offered this grim assessment : `` Both sides remain far apart on reaching agreement on a political solution . '' 
A senior Muslim cleric told CNN that in the month to come , loyalist soldiers could break their daily Ramadan to better fight against what the regime calls `` the colonialist , crusader aggression . '' 
Ramadan begins in just a few days . 
Expect Libya 's holy month to be a bloody one .

2011-07-27,"By Rania El Gamal and Stephen Addison BENGHAZI\/LONDON | Wed Jul 27 , 2011 10:32 am EDT BENGHAZI\/LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Pressure increased on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Wednesday as the rebels opposing him won diplomatic recognition from Britain and their leadership withdrew an offer for him to stay in Libya if he gave up power . 
Britain , one of the main foreign players in the campaign to oust Gaddafi , also expelled his diplomats from London and invited the rebel National Transitional Council to replace them . 
Gaddafi has scoffed at the efforts to end his 41-year-rule and has weathered a now-stalled rebel advance and NATO air raids on his forces and military infrastructure . 
France and Britain earlier this week dropped their insistence that he must leave the country as part of any settlement , a softening of position that indicated a growing anxiety to end a conflict that has now lasted five months . 
However , rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said on Wednesday the NTC had offered a month ago to allow Gaddafi to stay in Libya provided he step down first but that this offer had now expired . 
`` This offer is no longer valid , '' Abdel Jalil told reporters in the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi . 
The proposal was made about a month ago through U.N. envoy Abdel Elah al-Khatib with a two-week deadline attached , he said . 
The two weeks had passed . 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague announced that Britain now recognized the rebels as Libya 's legitimate government and unblocked 91 million pounds in frozen assets . 
`` This decision reflects the National Transitional Council 's increasing legitimacy , competence and success in reaching out to Libyans across the country , '' Hague said in London . 
It also invited the opposition to replace diplomats of Gaddafi 's government , who have been expelled from London . 
The United States and about 30 other nations have also recognized the opposition , potentially freeing up billions of dollars in frozen funds . 
Russia has criticized such moves , accusing nations of taking sides in a civil war . 
The rebels have long called on foreign governments to give them access to Libyan assets frozen abroad so they can cover the daily costs of running the east of the country , which they now control . 
They won $ 1.1 billion at a donor conference in June and received a further boost this week when Turkey dispatched the first cargo of fuel in a multi-million dollar supply deal . 
But their fighters remain poorly armed and often disorganized . 
Despite four months of NATO air strikes on pro-Gaddafi forces , the rebels have failed to make big gains toward Tripoli and appear unlikely to make a breakthrough before the start in early August of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . 
Nor has flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks yielded results . 
U.N. envoy Khatib visited both sides this week to no avail . 
There had also been speculation that talk of allowing Gaddafi to remain in Libya might pave the way for the International Criminal Court to reconsider the charges of crimes against humanity leveled against him , his son and intelligence chief . 
But the ICC said `` justice must be done '' irrespective of any political agreement . 
ICC official Fadi el-Abdallah said warrants of arrest have already been issued against Gaddafi , Saif al-Islam , his son , and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi . 
`` A political agreement does not affect the legal obligations or the judicial process . 
Justice must be done , in accordance with the rules of the Rome Statute -LRB- the ICC 's founding treaty -RRB- , '' el-Abdallah said . 
The United Nations said late on Tuesday that the two sides remained far apart on finding a political solution , a verdict underlined by Gaddafi 's camp calling for an end to air strikes before any talks can begin .

2011-07-27,"NALUT , Libya | Wed Jul 27 , 2011 7:54 pm EDT NALUT , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels fighting in Libya 's western mountains prepared on Thursday for a new offensive against Muammar Gaddafi 's troops , raising pressure on the Libyan leader a day after Britain granted diplomatic recognition to the opposition . 
With hopes fading of a negotiated settlement , both sides appear prepared for the five-month-old war to grind on into the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in August . 
The rebels said they were planning to attack the town of Ghezaia near the Tunisian border in the next 48 hours , and a Reuters correspondent saw dozens of heavily armed pickup trucks heading for the nearby rebel-held town of Nalut . 
`` We are reinforcing the position around Nalut and we will attack Ghezaia tomorrow or the next day for sure . 
We plan to take it , '' Omar Fakkan , a rebel commander , told Reuters . 
He said that forces from a number of rebel-held towns in the Nafusa Mountains were gathering in Nalut , ready for the attack . 
Rebel fighters have taken large swathes of Libya since the start of an uprising to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule , and now control much of the Nafusa mountain range , the northeast of Libya and the western city of Misrata . 
Yet they remain poorly armed and are often disorganized . 
Despite four months of NATO strikes , they have failed to reach the capital Tripoli and appear unlikely to make a breakthrough soon . 
Gaddafi has scoffed at the efforts to end his rule and has weathered the now-stalled rebel advance and the NATO air raids on his forces and military infrastructure . 
A recent flurry of diplomatic activity has yielded little , with the rebels insisting Gaddafi step down as a first step and his government saying his role is non-negotiable . 
United Nations envoy Abdel Elah al-Khatib visited both sides this week with plans for a ceasefire and a power-sharing government that excludes Gaddafi , but to no avail . 
Asked about Khatib 's proposal , rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said : `` We were surprised the day before yesterday that we are taking 10 steps back ... and he says to share power with Muammar Gaddafi 's regime . 
This is laughable . '' 
Gaddafi also appeared defiant on Wednesday , urging rebels to lay down their arms or suffer an ugly death . 
`` We all lead this battle , until victory , until martyrdom , '' he said in an audio message aired at a pro-Gaddafi rally in Zaltan , 140 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- west of his stronghold Tripoli . 
Ramping up pressure on Gaddafi , Britain expelled his diplomats from London on Wednesday and invited the rebel National Transitional Council to replace them . 
Foreign Secretary William Hague announced that Britain now recognized the rebels as Libya 's legitimate government and unblocked 91 million pounds -LRB- $ 148.7 million -RRB- in frozen assets . 
The United States and about 30 other nations have also recognized the opposition , potentially freeing up billions of dollars in frozen funds . 
`` This decision reflects the National Transitional Council 's increasing legitimacy , competence and success in reaching out to Libyans across the country , '' Hague said in London . 
Gaddafi 's government said the British move was `` illegal and irresponsible '' and a `` stain on the forehead of Britain . '' 
`` We will go to the International Court of Justice and the national courts in Britain , and we will use their justice , '' said Libya 's deputy foreign minister , Khaled Kaim . 
However , the British move won praise from rebels fighting in the western mountains . 
`` We are encouraged by what Britain has done and there is no way Gaddafi can stay in Libya , '' said Fakkan . 
`` The fighting will get much worse now because he will have to fight to survive and the Libyans do not want him . '' 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
This is a staged coup by NATO and I 'm sick of hearing MSM report it as anything else . 
they do nothing in Syria where there is practical genocide . 
but they take sides in a civil war in Libya . 
and violate almost every thing in the UN resolution that said they were only going to protect civilians ? 
the UK -LRB- BP -RRB- has oil money wrapped up in Libya , mostly the east France signs an oil deal with the rebels . 
or you sure all the `` rebels '' want democracy ? 
Gaddafi gave out 1million of ak47 to the people , do you think people hate him ? 
Why did n't they take over yet than ? 
Cause people are for him , Nato made incredible mess and was lying from the beginning . 
Shame on you West , for money you 'd kill anybody .

2011-07-28,"LONDON\/DUBAI | Thu Jul 28 , 2011 9:26 am EDT LONDON\/DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A tanker carrying crude oil has sailed from Benghazi , headed towards Sardinia , as Libya 's rebels sell the last of their stockpile to raise urgently needed funds , industry sources and ship tracking data said on Thursday . 
Traders said the tanker , Captain X Kyriakou , was chartered by Swiss-based trading house Vitol earlier in July and had been seen this week off Marsa El Hariga near Tobruk and Benghazi in eastern Libya , the rebels ' stronghold . 
The ship can carry up to 1 million barrels but was only partially loaded . 
The oil was from storage tanks rather than being fresh barrels from oilfields , the sources said . 
`` The cargo is the second export from the rebels and it may be the last before Libyan production restarts , '' one source said . 
Oilfields in eastern Libya have been unable to pump due to the escalating civil war as rebels have sought to oust the government of Muammar Gaddafi since February . 
In April , Vitol lifted a cargo of crude oil and delivered it to Hawaii . 
AIS ship tracking data showed the destination of Captain X Kyriakou was the Italian island of Sardinia , where it would await further orders , and the estimated arrival date is July 29 . 
Italian refiner Saras has the only oil refinery in Sardinia . 
Saras declined to comment . 
A Vitol spokesman and shipowner Athenian Sea Carriers also declined to comment . 
Vitol , along with Qatar Petroleum , has been permitted by the United States to help market oil for Libya 's Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- . 
Britain , one of the main foreign players in the campaign to oust Gaddafi , on Wednesday joined the United States in recognizing the rebels . 
Despite gaining increased international recognition , the rebels are short of funds and their advance has stalled . 
France and Britain earlier this week dropped their insistence that Gaddafi leave the country as part of any settlement , a softening of position that indicated a growing anxiety to end a conflict that has now lasted five months .

2011-07-29,"From Kareem Khadder and Michael Holmes , CNN Details murky on Libya rebel chief death `` There 's now a power vacuum within the army , '' reporter says The rebel military chief is killed in Benghazi Rebels claim battlefield successes in western Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The commander of Libya 's rebel army was killed in Benghazi along with two senior officers on Thursday , rebel leaders announced just hours after claiming big successes on the battlefield . 
The death of Gen. Abdul Fattah Younis came after the rebels ' Transitional National Council sought Younis for questioning about military matters and alleged ongoing ties to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , according to what Younis ' supporters told journalist James Hider of the Times of London . 
Supporters also shot at a Benghazi hotel and smashed its windows . 
Journalists had been gathered at the hotel for a press conference held by the rebel 's civilian leader who announced Younis was summoned back to Benghazi and was killed along with his two aides under unclear circumstances , Hider told CNN . 
Younis had served as interior minister in Gadhafi 's government until February , when he defected to the Benghazi-based rebel movement . 
He was killed along with a colonel and a lieutenant colonel , the rebels ' Transitional National Council said in a statement aired on their television network late Thursday . 
No further details were immediately released . 
Younis , a onetime general in Gadhafi 's army , told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to have Benghazi bombed -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands . 
Rebel forces have been battling to oust Gadhafi since then , aided by a NATO bombing campaign that has targeted government troops under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians . 
More explosions rocked Tripoli shortly before midnight Thursday -LRB- 5 p.m. ET -RRB- , indicating fresh airstrikes were under way in the Libyan capital . 
Earlier Thursday , the rebels said their forces had captured five towns and surrounded a sixth in the plains below the Nafusa mountain range , which borders Tunisia . 
Hundreds of rebels moved from their mountain positions at dawn . 
With heavier weapons leading the way with lighter armed fighters following , they initially encountered fierce resistance from Gadhafi 's loyalists . 
Col. Jumma Ibrahim , spokesman for the Military Council for the western mountain region , said several major battles had taken place before the towns were secured . 
He named the captured towns as al-Ruwais , Takout , al-Jawsh , Bader and al-Ghazzaya , and the surrounded town as Umm al-Far . 
Ibrahim said rebels were now negotiating with Gadhafi troops inside Umm al-Far . 
He said four rebels had been killed in the fighting and at least 20 were wounded , while 20 Gadhafi fighters had been captured . 
The claimed successes come after one of the biggest rebel offensives in recent weeks and , if true , puts the fighters closer to capturing a significant supply route used by Gadhafi forces . 
Ibrahim said that on the eastern side of the mountains , Gadhafi forces had been shelling rebel-held positions near Beir al-Ghanam and also near Qawalish . 
Rebel fighters last month suffered heavy casualties in a failed attempt to wrest control of al-Ghazzaya from forces loyal to Gadhafi . 
Last week , rebel fighters manning hilltops in the western mountains overlooking al-Ghazzaya told CNN that they had been watching the government forces reinforcing their weapon stocks with heavy military machinery and rocket launchers . 
The United Kingdom on Wednesday recognized the Benghazi-based rebels as Libya 's legitimate government , and the United States recently recognized the council as the country 's `` legitimate governing authority . '' 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Wednesday reiterated his stance that Gadhafi could remain in Libya if he leaves power , but added that the best thing would be for him to face justice at the International Criminal Court , which is seeking his arrest . 
CNN 's Michael Martinez contributed to this report .

2011-07-29,"By the CNN Wire Staff Alleged Libyan rape victim Eman al-Obeidy says she is excited and happy to be in the United States . 
Eman al-Obeidy arrives in New York , flies to her final destination She had been in a UN refugee facility in Romania since June 6 She thanks the U.S. government , secretary of state -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eman al-Obeidy , who caught the world 's attention in March when she publicly accused members of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces of gang-raping her , has relocated to the United States . 
After spending 54 days in a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees facility in Romania , Obeidy arrived in New York late Wednesday night , then boarded a flight to the destination where she will reside . 
She told CNN she is excited and happy to be in the United States , and passed her thanks to the U.S. government and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , adding that she hopes to meet her someday . 
Other than her brief conversation with a CNN producer , she said she is not ready to speak to the media . 
Alleged Libya rape victim heads to Malta Qatar deports alleged Libyan rape victim Rape suspects accuse woman of slander The relocation is the latest leg in a harrowing odyssey that began March 26 , the day al-Obeidy stormed into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli , Libya , where international journalists were having breakfast , and shouted that she had been taken from a checkpoint and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 of Gadhafi 's militiamen . 
A scuffle ensued , and government officials and hotel staff whisked her outside to a car , and she was driven away . 
She was n't heard from for more than a week . 
In the days afterward , in interviews with CNN and other media , she spoke graphically of her ordeal and said she feared she would never feel safe in Libya . 
In May , she escaped to Tunisia with the help of a defecting military officer and Libyan rebels , and found temporary sanctuary in Qatar before being deported back to Benghazi in Libya in early June . 
She was granted asylum in the United States , and on June 6 arrived at the U.N. refugee facility in Romania .

2011-07-29,"Syria pipeline blown up ahead of Friday protests 18 civilians die in Afghan IED attack Fort Hood suspect had jihadist bomb recipe US accuses Iran of helping al Qaeda network Iraq end-game : US `` losing to Iran '' Senior al Qaeda figure in Algeria killed Mystery over murder of Libyan rebel commander Mystery surrounds the circumstances of the killing of Libya 's rebel military commander , Gen Abdel Fattah Younes , a day after he and two aides were shot . 
Rebel leader Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said they had been killed by gunmen after Gen Younes was recalled from the front for questioning by judges . 
He said the ringleader of the attack had been held but he gave no details about his identity or the motive . 
It is not disclosed where the attack happened ; nor where the bodies are . 
The general -- a former interior minister who had served at the heart of Col Muammar Gadhafi 's regime since the 1969 coup -- joined the rebels at the beginning of the Libyan uprising in February . 
The BBC 's Ian Pannell in the rebel-held city of Misrata says his defection was seen as a coup for the opposition , but there had been rumors that he had kept contacts with the Gadhafi leadership . 
\* Reading haltingly from a brief communique , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , president of the Transitional National Council , said pro-Gadhafi gunmen had infiltrated rebel-held areas , but he did not specifically blame them for the killings . 
Abdul Jalil refused to take questions from reporters . 
Abdul Jalil did not address reports that Younis had been summoned to Benghazi for questioning by the rebel leadership on suspicion of continuing loyalties to Gadhafi , saying only that he was called for military discussions . 
One rebel loyalist in Benghazi with close ties to the council said Younis was to have been `` interrogated '' Thursday by the council about alleged contacts with government forces . 
Possible tribal split among rebels Adding to the confusion , the rebels had said hours earlier they had already detained the commander , Abdel-Fattah Younis , on suspicion his family might still have ties to the regime of Moammar Gadhafi , raising questions about whether he might have been assassinated by his own side . 
Such a scenario would signal a troubling split within the rebel movement at a time when their forces have failed to make battlefield gains despite nearly four months of NATO airstrikes against Gadhafi 's forces . 
It could also shake the confidence of the United States , Britain and several dozen other nations that have recognized the rebel council as Libya 's legitimate leaders . 
`` The Libyan military part -LRB- of the TNC -RRB- is in disarray , '' said Dirk Vandewalle , a professor at Dartmouth University who specializes in Libya . 
`` It has never been able to really define a clear command strategy and my hunch is that it probably never will , despite all of the aid it is getting . '' 
From the New York Times : The specter of a violent tribal conflict within the rebel ranks touches on a central fear of the Western nations backing the Libyan insurrection : that the rebels democratic goals could give way to a tribal civil war over Libya s oil resources . 
Colonel Qaddafi has often warned of such a possibility as he has fought to keep power , while the rebel leaders have argued that their cause transcends Libya s age-old tribal divisions . 
A pickup truck full of angry armed Obeidi tribesmen arrived at the front of the hotel -LRB- in Benghazi that acts as rebel hq . -RRB- . 
Some fired their Kalashnikovs at hotel windows , shattering them , and others shot into the air . 
One man raced with his rifle through the front door of the hotel , and two witnesses said they heard gunshots inside . 
Rebels in west seize four towns In the western Nafusa mountain range southwest of the capital , Tripoli , hundreds of rebels launched a broad offensive against government forces Thursday , seizing three small towns and advancing on others to secure a major supply route near the Tunisian border , rebel spokesmen said . 
Four rebel fighters were killed and several wounded while taking the small towns of Jawsh , Ghezaya and Takut , Abdel-Salam Othman said . 
The claimed successes come after one of the biggest rebel offensives in recent weeks and , if true , puts the fighters closer to capturing a significant supply route used by Gadhafi forces . 
Ibrahim said that on the eastern side of the mountains , Gadhafi forces had been shelling rebel-held positions near Beir al-Ghanam and also near Qawalish . 
The authorities in Syria have said saboteurs blew up an oil pipeline near Homs , a hub of protest against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . 
The attack was the second of its kind this month . 
It left a crater 15m -LRB- 50ft -RRB- wide and oil gushing from the broken pipe , the state news agency Sana said . 
Overnight , at least five people were killed during raids by security forces , activists say . 
The deaths occurred in the north-eastern city of Deir al-Zour and a suburb of the capital Damascus , in the south-west of the country . 
Activists and opposition groups are calling on the `` silent majority '' to stand up and be counted in the last Friday mass rallies across Syria before Ramadan . 
Opposition groups have given Friday rallies the label `` Your silence is killing us '' in attempts to mobilize prominent community leaders , intellectuals , the business elite , religious leaders and other Arab countries to join the opposition cause . 
While mass protests have been marked in regional centers around the country , Syria s two largest capital cities , Damascus and Aleppo , have so far failed to attract the large numbers of protesters like the regional centers of Hama , Homs and elsewhere . 
Many believe the protest movement must take hold of the business and political capitals to progress from the deadly ritual stalemate that has claimed the lives of up to 1,500 civilians . 
Will Ramadan provide new platform for Syrian protests ? 
The relentless cycle of protest and crackdown in Syria over the last four months appears poised to enter a new phase in the coming Muslim holy month of Ramadan , with activists planning to capitalize on religious rhythms to hold nightly demonstrations despite fears of an even harsher government reaction . 
The protesters say it should be easier to gather people since they would ordinarily end their days of fasting and nights of feasting with a visit to mosques for prayers . 
Their hope is that mobilizing people every day , rather than waiting for large Friday protests , will wear down a government that has so far been able to hang on to support among substantial sectors of the population despite protests that have grown larger and more widespread . 
Activists , who have posted video on YouTube instructing protesters on the plan , said they expect demonstrations to begin around 10:30 p.m. , just after people gather for the tarawih , the prayer performed only in Ramadan . 
More civilians killed in southern Afghanistan Two roadside bombs killed 19 people and wounded four Friday in Afghanistan as civilians are increasingly being caught in crossfire of the fighting between the Taliban and the U.S.-led coalition . 
A minibus ran over a bomb in Nahri Sarraj district of Helmand province , with the blast killing all 18 passengers , said Kamaluddin Sherzai , the province s deputy police chief . 
`` The mine was very powerful and destroyed the vehicle , '' he said . 
`` They were all civilians . 
Some were children . '' 
In its midyear report , the United Nations said the number of Afghan civilians killed in war-related violence rose by 15 percent in the first half of 2011 . 
The report said 1,462 Afghan civilians lost their lives , including 444 killed by roadside bombs . 
During the first half of last year , 1,271 Afghan civilians were killed in the war . 
Talks on long-term Afghan -- US partnership stumble Negotiations to set the terms of the U.S. partnership with Afghanistan in the decade after 2014 are faltering as the two countries struggle to bridge the gap between their demands , according to U.S. and Afghan officials . 
After months of talks , some of the officials involved are growing increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of a substantive `` strategic partnership '' declaration anytime soon that would allow for a long-term U.S. troop presence in exchange for protection guarantees for Afghanistan and support for the nation s security forces . 
U.S. - led NATO forces are set to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 . 
`` I see a situation building that will turn negative , '' said Shaida Mohammad Abdali , Afghanistan s deputy national security adviser . 
`` If the U.S. is really interested in staying in Afghanistan , it must show it practically to the Afghan government and the people . 
And respond to what we need . '' 
UN stiffens sanctions against Pakistan Taliban The U.N. Security Council on Friday will impose sanctions on the Pakistani Taliban , an extremist Islamic organization which American officials blame for masterminding the botched September 2010 Times Square bombing plot . 
The group , which is formally named Tehrik-E-Taliban Pakistan -LRB- TTP -RRB- , will be added Friday to a U.N. blacklist of terrorist organizations linked to Al Qaeda . 
It was already placed on the U.S. Foreign Terrorist Organization list last September , some four months after the U.S. accused the group of attempting to set off a car bomb in the packed New York City tourism center . 
The United States proposed in recent weeks that the organization be added to the U.N. list , citing the widening reach of the organization 's terror targets . 
Australia , Canada , Britain , France and Pakistan cosponsored the U.S. measure . 
Yemen : tribal clashes kill 40 Associated Press : Clashes between Yemeni soldiers and armed tribesmen in a mountainous region north of the capital killed at least 40 people yesterday , a military official said . 
The fighting in the Arhab region is one example of the wider security collapse across Yemen since the outbreak of a massive uprising seeking to topple President Ali Abdullah Saleh six months ago . 
Armed tribesmen are battling security forces in Arhab , the southern city of Taiz , and elsewhere , while militants believed to be linked to Al Qaeda have overrun towns in the country s restive south . 
Yesterday s clashes northeast of Sana s international airport began when tribesmen attacked a base belonging to the Republican Guard , said Sheik Hamid Assem of the Arhab tribe . 
Shabab send more fighters to Mogadishu Heavy fighting broke out Thursday in the Somali capital , Mogadishu , as African Union peacekeepers launched an offensive to protect famine relief efforts from attacks by the Shabab rebels , officials said . 
At least six people died . 
The Shabab , which initially said they would allow the aid to be delivered , changed their mind last week . 
The rebels have sent 300 reinforcement fighters to Mogadishu in recent days , said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda , spokesman for the African Union peacekeeping force . 
He said the Shabab were trying to prevent aid from reaching the tens of thousands of famine refugees who have poured into Mogadishu this month . 
CNN 's Nima Elbagir reports from Mogadishu : `` Tens of thousands of people fled the Somali capital of Mogadishu because of the violence and insecurity here . 
They 're now having to come back seeking refuge from the famine that hit them in those areas they fled to , and it seems that that violence is following them , '' Elbagir says . 
Senior al Qaeda figure in Algeria killed Algerian security forces killed a top member of an Al-Qaeda regional offshoot and two accomplices who were trying to reach Algiers aboard a car laden with explosives , a government official said Thursday . 
The official said Abdelkahar Belhadj , son of former Islamic leader Ali Belhadj , was killed Monday as he was heading for the capital Algiers with a small group of Islamic extremists and that they were plotting a bomb attack . 
Belhadj , born in 1988 , joined Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- in 2006 and took the battle name of `` Mouawia , '' in tribute to one of the companions of the Prophet Mohammad . 
Belhadj s father had been deputy leader of the Islamic Salvation Front -LRB- FIS -RRB- , whose armed wing tried to overthrow the government in a bloody civil war from 1992 to the early 2000s . 
Iraq -- as US leaves , Iran steps in American influence within Iraq is on the wane . 
U.S. officials believe the Iranian government is trying to fill the void , stepping up both its commercial dealings with Iraq s government the two countries , along with Syria , signed a $ 10 billion natural-gas pipeline deal earlier this week and its covert support to the armed militias inflicting casualties on the departing U.S. troops . 
`` Their intent is to bleed U.S. forces on the way out of Iraq for some sort of moral victory , as well as to reestablish coercive control over Iraqi governors in the south by showing off their capacity to carry out these kinds of sophisticated attacks , '' said Mike Oates , a recently-retired , three-star Army general and former commander of all U.S. forces in southern Iraq . 
`` They re trying to prick us as we leave . '' 
U.S. military officials acknowledge that it will be difficult , if not impossible , to prevent Iranian-made weaponry from being smuggled into Iraq . 
US says Iran supporting al Qaeda The United States has accused Iran of providing sanctuary to an al Qaeda network that provides help to jihadists moving between the Middle East , Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury Thursday announced the designation of six members of the network , including its alleged leader Ezedin Abdel Aziz Khalil , and described Iran as a `` critical transit point for funding to support al-Qaeda s activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan . '' 
`` This network serves as the core pipeline through which al-Qaeda moves money , facilitators and operatives from across the Middle East to South Asia , '' the U.S. Treasury said in a statement . 
Not so fast The recently departed director of the nation s main counterterrorism center said Thursday that Al Qaeda in Pakistan still posed a serious threat to the United States , and he warned that assessments that Al Qaeda was on the verge of collapse lacked `` accuracy and precision . '' 
The comments by the official , Michael E. Leiter , who stepped down three weeks ago as head of the National Counterterrorism Center , are the most significant pushback to a growing chorus of statements by American officials that the death of Osama bin Laden and years of Central Intelligence Agency drone strikes in Pakistan have brought the United States `` within reach of strategically defeating Al Qaeda , '' as Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta put it recently . 
Mr. Leiter said that Al Qaeda s leadership and structure in Pakistan were `` on the ropes , '' but he contended that `` the core organization is still there and could launch some attacks '' and that `` Pakistan remains a huge problem . '' 
He noted that the failed plot to blow up an explosives-packed vehicle in Times Square in May 2010 was carried out by a Pakistani-American trained by the Pakistani Taliban . 
The Qaeda affiliate in Yemen also remains especially dangerous , he added . 
Mr. Leiter also raised concerns that a decade of intensive paramilitary operations by the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen had begun to change the nature of the spy service , and not necessarily all for the better . 
`` The question has to be asked : Has that in some ways diminished some of its strategic , long-term intelligence collection and analysis mission ? '' 
he said , citing the potential impact on traditional espionage and analysis of longer-range issues like China and counterproliferation . 
The infamous Norwegian gunner planned to carry out more attacks on the same day , his lawyer has said Friday . 
`` Breivik planned to carry out a few more attacks on July 22 , on a slightly different scale . 
However , something happened , about which I can t yet speak , and his plans didn t come to anything , '' Geir Lippestad told Norway s Aftenposten newspaper . 
Anders Breivik is accused of killing over 70 people in Norway in two terror attacks last Friday . 
Breivik has confessed to both crimes . 
He is due to be interrogated for the second time by police today . 
Ahead of yesterday s emergency counterterrorism meeting , EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom spoke of a `` huge lack of political leadership in allowing right-wing sentiment to bleed into the mainstream . 
`` Blaming Islam or immigration for all sorts of problems has become normal , Malmstrom told the European Voice newspaper . 
She cited a `` permissive climate in which such views `` are no longer seen as extreme . 
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said Germany s intelligence agencies had far-right groups under `` intensive surveillance , but there was a greater risk in extremists like Breivik who operate alone and under the radar . 
`` Among the right extremists , we know of some who could be dangerous , but they re not the problem -- those who we have an eye on -- but rather those who radicalize in secret , he told the Rheinische Post . 
Fort Hood case : Abdo had jihadist bomb recipe An AWOL Muslim American Army private arrested near Fort Hood has told investigators that he wanted to attack fellow soldiers at the military post , the police chief in Killeen , Texas , said Thursday . 
`` Military personnel were a target of this suspect , '' Chief Dennis Baldwin told reporters about Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo , who is expected to face federal charges . 
Baldwin said Abdo , who was arrested Wednesday , had no accomplices , `` as far as I know . '' 
He added , `` We are not aware of any additional threats to the safety of our community . '' 
New York Times adds : A U.S. soldier who was accused Thursday of planning to attack troops near Fort Hood , Tex. , has told investigators that he was acting in support of Maj. Nidal M. Hasan , the Army psychiatrist who has been charged in the killing of 13 people at the base in 2009 , according to congressional and federal officials . 
Pfc. Naser Abdo , 21 , was arrested in Killeen , Tex. , after authorities said they discovered bombmaking materials in his motel room , as well as a copy of an article from the al-Qaeda magazine Inspire , which is produced by the terrorist group s Yemen affiliate . 
The officials said Abdo was planning to set off bombs at locations outside the base where soldiers gather and to follow the explosions with gunfire . 
`` I would classify this as a terror plot , '' Police Chief Dennis Baldwin told reporters in Killeen . 
Law enforcement officials said Abdo would be charged in federal court with possession of bombmaking materials , among other offenses . 
\* CNN 's Randi Kaye interviewed Greg Ebert , a former police officer working at the Killeen , Texas gun store where Pfc Naser Jason Abdo went to buy supplies . 
Here is some of what Ebert told CNN 's Newsroom : `` He came to the store to purchase a quantity of smokeless gunpowder and did not seem to know what it was . 
It was just really odd , his behavior . '' 
`` He selected six canisters of smokeless gunpowder , placed them on the counter and then asked the manager `` well , what is smokeless powder ? '' 
If you do n't know what it is , why in the world would you buy that much ? '' 
Budget cuts and the US Navy From Politico : A large budget cut will force a change in U.S. naval strategy , Adm. Chief of Naval Ops Jonathan Greenert told SASC at his confirmation hearing Thursday , echoing his comments earlier this week to a HASC subcommittee . 
`` Our options are limited . 
We ca n't hollow the force . 
... We ca n't go to our personnel . 
Our Navy has n't changed much since 2008 in force - in our manning level , in our manning plan . 
If we reduce force structure , that would exacerbate the problem we already have . 
And if we reduce modernization , that is , go to the ship building and aircraft accounts , I 'm concerned about the industrial base . 
So we have sort of a conundrum here . 
And I believe that this needs to be a strategic approach to such a large reduction , '' he said .

2011-07-29,"July 29 , 2011 | By Hussein Saddique , CNN Malaak Al-Shami , who arrived in the U.S. on Thursday , was injured when a rocket hit her bedroom wall in Misrata , Libya . 
Five year-old Malaak Al-Shami arrived in the U.S. on Thursday evening to get fitted with a prosthetic leg after suffering injuries in Libya 's raging civil war . 
She landed at New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport from Germany , the last part in a journey arranged by the Global Medical Relief Fund , a U.S. nonprofit . 
The group aids children who have lost the use of , or are missing , limbs or eyes . 
It says it is funded almost exclusively by donations . 
Malaak and her parents are being housed temporarily at The Ronald McDonald House of Long Island , which shelters families with sick children undergoing treatment at area hospitals . 
`` All the kids that come here , they 're bewildered , reluctant ; and once they 're here , they open up , '' said Elissa Mantonti , founder of the nonprofit . 
Malaak , who arrived in a wheelchair , initially appeared to be tired , but she quickly perked up when the other children housed in the facility came out to greet her . 
She got off her wheelchair and started exploring a toy room and play space with the other children . 
She quickly befriended three Iraqi boys who , like her , speak Arabic . 
They , too , were brought to the U.S. by the nonprofit . 
They suffered their injuries in Iraq 's continuing violence , according to Mantonti . 
Malaak 's rebel-controlled neighborhood in the western Libyan city of Misrata was attacked by pro-government forces on May 13 . 
A Grad rocket , which looks like an overgrown bullet about 9 feet long and 15 inches around , slammed into her bedroom wall and exploded , causing a gaping hole . 
Her 3-year-old brother and 1-year-old sister died in the attack . 
Malaak 's right leg was severed below the knee in the attack . 
According to Mantonti , her organization helped arrange for the family to be ferried by boat from Misrata , which is still under siege from pro-government forces despite recent rebel advances . 
From there , the family boarded a flight to Frankfurt , Germany , and continued onward to New York . 
The girl 's father expressed a mixture of hope and sadness upon his arrival in the U.S. `` I feel joy that my daughter will get treatment for her leg , '' Mustafa Al-Shami said . 
`` At the same time , I feel grief for the loss of my two other children . 
And , even though I feel that Malaak may never be the same after the attack , I 'm so happy that she will be able to walk and run again one day . '' 
She is scheduled for an initial fitting for a prosthetic leg at Shriners Hospitals in Philadelphia , with the fitting process taking up to seven weeks , Mantonti said . 
The family plans to return to Libya once the treatment is complete .

2011-07-29,"Libyan Rebel Commander Killed ; Hitting the Debt Ceiling ; Political Ramifications of Debt Crisis ; Doctors Treat Somalia 's Malnourished Aired July 29 , 2011 - 08:00:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . 
KRISTIE LU STOUT , HOST : Welcome to NEWS STREAM , where news and technology meet . 
I 'm Kristie Lu Stout , in Hong Kong . 
Now , the head of Libya 's rebel army dies . 
Where does this leave the rebels in the fight for Libya ? 
Republican Leader John Boehner delays a vote on his proposal to fix the U.S. debt crisis . 
Will lawmakers vote on his plan today ? 
And one year after devastating floods hit much of Pakistan , many of the victims are still waiting for help . 
Mystery surrounds the death of this man , General Abdul Fatah Younis . 
Now , he commanded Libya 's rebel army , and officials say that he was killed , along with two of his senior officers . 
But we do not know exactly where he was killed or , more importantly , who was behind his death . 
Now , the chairman of the Transitional National Council made this announcement . 
MUSTAFA ABDUL JALIL , CHAIRMAN , LIBYAN TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL COUNCIL -LRB- through translator -RRB- : In deep sadness , we announce the death of General Abdul Fatah Younis , the chief general of the Libyan army , and his two companions , Colonel Mohammed Khamis and Lieutenant Colonel Nasir al - Madhkur . 
STOUT : Younis had been summoned back to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi to face questions about military matters , and reports say he has alleged ongoing ties to Moammar Gadhafi . 
You may recall that Younis defected from the Libyan leader 's government back in February . 
He held the post of interior minister and was considered Colonel Gadhafi 's second in command before his defection . 
Now , Younis ' death leaves the rebel army without a leader as the opposition claims advances in the west . 
Ivan Watson joins us live from the Libyan capital of Tripoli . 
And Ivan , is there any more information about the circumstances of his death ? 
IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : No. . 
This assassination really raises the specter of the possibility of infighting among rebel ranks , the possibility of a power vacuum within the rebel military command , and a lot of questions about just how this general was killed . 
According to the leader of the Transitional National Council , in a very short press conference that he gave last night in the rebel capital of Benghazi , he said that Abdul Fatah Younis had been summoned to Benghazi from the front line around the oil report of Brega and that the assassination occurred somewhere along the way . 
What was even stranger was he went on to say that they were trying to find Younis ' body , as well as the attackers who carried out this alleged assassination . 
There had been a lot of rumors , Kristie , at the time that he was being brought under arrest by the rebel council , and we know that he had engaged in power struggles with another rival rebel commander in the five months that this civil war has been taking place . 
There was some gunfire from Younis ' supporters last night after the press conference announcing Younis ' death took place , gunfire outside the hotel where the announcement was made . 
We 've been monitoring Libya Alhurra television , pro-rebel TV , which has been showing a live picture from Benghazi of Friday prayers and some speeches by supporters of Younis who have been vowing vengeance and also pledging support to the Transitional National Council . 
Here in Tripoli , officials have been quite thus far , have not offered any official reaction to the death of a former comrade in arms of Moammar Gadhafi who defected early on to the rebel side . 
We 're waiting for some kind of reaction from the Gadhafi regime to this very important development -- Kristie . 
STOUT : And Ivan , what is the state of play on the battlefield ? 
And what will be the impact of Younis ' death on the rebels ' ability to fight this civil war ? 
WATSON : Still trying to figure that out . 
It 's important to note that the ground war is being fought on three fronts -- in the east , around that oil port of Brega ; in the central port of Misrata , which is held by the rebels ; and in the west , along the Tunisian border , where the rebels report they 've made some gains in the last 24 hours . 
Tripoli was being bombed by NATO warplanes last night within hours of the announcement of Abdul Fatah Younis ' death , and there has been an increase in the amount of NATO bomb attacks here in the Libyan capital in recent days . 
Some of that footage we can show you . 
Sometimes the strikes are quite close and pretty frightening here . 
But this was described by the U.S. ' top military commander as a stalemate just a few days ago . 
It will be very interesting to see whether this could be a game-changer in this grinding and bloody five-month conflict , the loss of the main rebel commander -- Kristie . 
STOUT : Ivan Watson , joining us live from Tripoli . 
And while Libya 's rebels have struggled on the battlefield , they are making significant political progress . 
Now , the countries in red on this map , these are the countries that recognize the Transitional National Council as Libya 's legitimate government . 
Now , as you 'll recall , on Wednesday the United Kingdom expelled Colonel Gadhafi 's diplomats and turned the embassy over to the opposition group . 
That comes less than two weeks after the U.S. officially recognized the rebel government . 
In Egypt , a demonstration for national unity is being dominated by Islamic groups . 
Cairo 's Tahrir Square is packed with protesters . 
Some are political activists who have been camping there for weeks . 
They say that they are keeping pressure on the country 's military rulers to implement promised reforms . 
In Syria , a number of people are also expected to take to the streets after prayers . 
Now , let 's bring it up for you . 
This is a live Web stream . 
It comes from the city of Hama . 
Now , protesters are trying to topple the regime of President Bashar al - Assad . 
If we can bring that webcam for you -- we 'll bring it to you a little bit later on the program . 
Now , meanwhile , our Arwa Damon , she says the slogan for today 's rally is `` Your Silence is Deadly . '' 
That is a criticism of the international community for not taking what they consider sufficient action against President al-Assad . 
Meanwhile , in the United States , members of the House of Representatives could vote later today on Speaker John Boehner 's bill to raise the U.S. debt ceiling . 
And if that sounds familiar , it 's because they were meant to vote on the measure on Thursday , but the vote was postponed late in the evening after Boehner failed to rally enough support from within his own party . 
He has been struggling to come up with a plan that meets demands of the party 's more conservative Tea Party wing . 
REP. JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R-OH -RRB- , SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE : The bill 's not perfect . 
I 've never said it was perfect , nobody in my caucus believes it 's perfect . 
But what this bill reflects is a sincere , honest effort to end this crisis in a bipartisan way , to send it to the Senate , where it can receive action . 
STOUT : Now , Democrats in the Senate say that they will vote down Boehner 's plan if it does eventually pass in the House . 
Both sides are holding caucus meetings on Friday to work out the next step . 
And meanwhile , the clock continues to click toward the big August the 2nd deadline . 
And without a plan to raise the U.S. debt ceiling by then , the U.S. could face it 's first-ever default . 
Now , it is something that would not only negatively impact the U.S. economy , but financial institutions around the world . 
So , does the White House have a backup plan if lawmakers do n't get their act together ? 
Mary Snow joins us now from CNN New York with more -- Mary . 
MARY SNOW , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Kristie , the president in this case is legally limited . 
One constitutional expert at Yale Law School looked at the scenarios where the president could bypass Congress if Congress does n't reach a deal . 
And this expert took a look at the question of , could the government just print more money ? 
The answer is , not unless it came in the form of coins . 
BOEHNER : It 's a zip-a-dee-doo-dah day . 
SNOW -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : And just days until the government can no longer borrow money . 
If Congress does n't reach an agreement in time , could there be a Plan B for President Obama to act on his own and raise money ? 
Fitting under the category of desperate times calling for desperate measures , there is actually some talk of issuing two $ 1 trillion coins . 
Constitutional law expert Jack Balkin says there is a statutory limit on the amount of paper currency that can be in circulation , but not on coins . 
It 's an idea he calls science fiction . 
JACK BALKIN , YALE LAW SCHOOL : I think what it underscores is that people are now trying to investigate different ways of resolving an artificially created financial crisis , fiscal crisis . 
And I think the problem is that these solutions have been offered precisely because the situation we have been put in is so absurd . 
SNOW : A potential option for the president that has been taken more seriously is the idea of him invoking a clause in the 14th Amendment where he would raise the debt ceiling without congressional authorization . 
But the president himself has indicated that is not on the table . 
BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : I have talked to my lawyers . 
They do not -- they do not -- they are not persuaded that that is a winning argument . 
SNOW : One way for the government to raise money is to sell assets . 
Gold now at record highs is one of those assets . 
But -- JAY POWELL , BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER : There is no likelihood of that at all . 
If the United States government were to announce that it was going to sell some gold to pay its bills , one can only imagine what would happen to the price of gold . 
You would want to be out of the way of that collapsing price . 
SNOW : Jay Powell was undersecretary at the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush . 
He has been briefing members of Congress , saying he 's been separating fact from fiction , even getting asked if the government can issue IOUs . 
POWELL : If the debt ceiling is not increased , if no deal is made , then people need to understand there 's no secret bag of tricks , there 's no magic bullet that will allow us to avoid defaulting on our non-debt-related payments . 
SNOW : Bottom line , Jay Powell says , is there 's nothing really the executive branch can practically do in the absence of a deal -- Kristie . 
And for more on the political ramifications of the debt crisis , CNN senior political analyst David Gergen joins us now from CNN London . 
And David , this has become a huge test for the Speaker of the House . 
Now , why is it that House Speaker John Boehner was not able to get support from his own party , and what is at stake for him ? 
DAVID GERGEN , CNN SR. . 
POLITICAL ANALYST : Well , there 's a great deal more at stake for the country and for the world , of course , but this is a crisis for John Boehner . 
If he can not win this vote , he may well lose his speakership over time . 
I think it 's important to keep in mind that his problem is he has 240 members . 
There are no Democrats willing to vote for his plan . 
And he can only lose about 23 . 
But see that in context . 
That means he has about 90 percent of his caucus with him . 
He has 90 percent of Republicans in the House with him . 
There 's another 10 percent that 's holding out , and they want deeper cuts . 
They want something more significant . 
They 're the mostly Tea Party types who were elected with an avalanche of criticism of Washington coming from the grassroots of America . 
And it 's been hard for him to corral . 
But right now they are in danger if -- I think they have to vote today . 
I think we 've entered a crucial 24-hour period , and I think they will -- it will have to come up or come down today , because we do n't have time now . 
We 're down to the final strokes . 
STOUT : That 's right . 
We only have four days left . 
Now , I want to ask you about the overall political tone of this debate . 
In the U.S. , the debt limit has been raised dozens of times in recent years , but without the extreme partisan bickering that we 've been seeing in recent weeks . 
So why is the climate so different this time around ? 
GERGEN : Well , I think the debt ceiling offered a tool , if you would , that Republicans could latch on to , to bring home and force reductions in spending . 
This fight has been brewing for a long , long time , and the United States is deeply polarized about the size and shape of government . 
How big should government be ? 
How much should the federal government spend ? 
I mean , the Republicans basically want government to spend about 18 percent of GDP on its activities , whereas Democrats say no , we 'd like it around 23 or so . 
That may sound small , the difference between 18 and 23 , but when you translate it into dollars , it 's actually huge . 
It 's about $ 700 billion a year and a difference and a vision of what the government ought to do . 
So , that 's part of the fight . 
And there 's also , frankly , a growing fear in the country that we 've allowed the national debt to grow so rapidly , that it really could lead to the decline of America -- a reduction in growth , and in fact would impact the world . 
There 's a serious study that has been well accepted now across the world by two economists named Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart . 
They 're world class economists who have studied 800 years of financial crises , and one of their main conclusions is that a country which allows its debt , its public debt to grow to more than 90 percent of its gross national product , its GDP , is a country that 's in trouble , and we 'll see its growth rate decline and may stumble into a lost decade , as Japan did . 
Well , the United States , if you add federal debt to state and local , it 's past 90 percent now . 
And so there 's a real fear of the direction we 're moving . 
And responsible people on both sides of the aisle want to get the debt down . 
The differences are on how you do it , whether you cut government a lot or whether you raise taxes and cut government some . 
And those are pretty fundamental differences . 
STOUT : Yes , it 's a clash of two fundamentally different philosophies . 
The last question for you , David Gergen , you have been an adviser to numerous U.S. presidents . 
I wanted to get your thoughts on President Obama 's leadership and his handling of the debt crisis so far . 
GERGEN : Let me be very clear that all sides in this conflict have their fingerprints all over and bear responsible for this disaster . 
I mean , this is an embarrassment , for the United States to be in this position . 
It 's telling the world our political system does n't work very well and so forth , and certainly there are a lot of people very deeply concerned in the financial community . 
Does the president bear some responsibility ? 
Has his leadership been all that it should have been ? 
Much earlier in the game , where there was something called the Bowles - Simpson Commission that reported and had a pathway to a $ 4 trillion reduction in our deficits over the next 10 years , had Republican support within the commission , had the president seized that report back in December of last year and it pushed it with that kind of bipartisanship that went into the report , I think he would have secured an agreement a lot faster , and a much bigger agreement . 
Were there other moments along the way ? 
If Lyndon Johnson were in the White House right now he 'd be bringing people in , he 'd be knocking heads together , he 'd be corralling people . 
He 'd be exploiting their weaknesses , making tradeoffs , and you 'd probably get a deal . 
Barack Obama is a more cerebral individual . 
He has many , many strengths . 
Leading the Congress and corralling people in Congress is not one of his strengths . 
Now , the U.S. debt problem has led to one curious statistic I 'd like to share with you . 
Now , take a look at this . 
At the end of Wednesday , July the 27th , the U.S. Treasury had a closing balance of just under $ 74 billion . 
But according to Apple 's most recent earnings statement -- check it out -- Apple has over $ 76 billion in cash and marketable securities , meaning the U.S. Treasury has less cash on hand than the maker of the iPhone . 
Now , Spain 's prime minister has set a date for a general election four months earlier than planned . 
Jose Luis Zapatero says Spain will go to the polls on November the 20th , and that will allow a new government to be in power by the end of the year to help restore financial stability there . 
Ahead on NEWS STREAM , the crisis in Somalia . 
U.N. aid arrives , but then the violence picks up . 
We 'll get the latest on the situation there through the eyes of a refugee doctor . 
Plus , it has been one year since massive flooding ravaged parts of Pakistan . 
We 'll see how they 're coping now . 
And as Norway continues to mourn the massacre one week ago today , police there are meeting again with the man who has admitted he is responsible . 
Now , many Somali families have fled the famine gripping the country . 
Some have walked hundreds of kilometers with limited food and water in the hopes of receiving safe assistance . 
ITV 's Martin Geissler brings us the latest on their plight and looks at the staff working for their welfare . 
MARTIN GEISSLER , ITV NEWS -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : This is the front line in the fight against Somalia 's famine . 
With basic facilities and equipment , the staff at Hagadera do extraordinary work . 
With each new day , John Kiogora and his team of medics know they 'll face crises in this intensive care ward . 
They 've seen it all here many , many times . 
And first thing this morning , they saw it again . 
DR. JOHN KIOGORA , INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE : Very sick , you see . 
The child is severely malnourished . 
GEISSLER : Abdi Rahman -LRB- ph -RRB- is 1 year old and unconscious . 
-LRB- on camera -RRB- : What are your chances of saving a child like this ? 
KIOGORA : Fifty-fifty now . 
We 've seen a child like this and you just want to do your best . 
GEISSLER : Every minute is crucial at this stage . 
The team give Abdi Rahman -LRB- ph -RRB- a glucose boost . 
Fluids now are his only chance . 
-LRB- on camera -RRB- : So there 's still some reason to hope ? 
KIOGORA : Yes , there 's some hope still . 
We have n't given up . 
You ca n't give up , yes . 
GEISSLER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Fifteen minutes were all it took for this dramatic change . 
KIOGORA : The child is coming up , huh ? 
GEISSLER : Hooked up to a drip , the baby has been revived . 
So that 's the most I keep saying , because the child -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . 
He was actually dying -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . 
GEISSLER : Lunch for the staff in this field hospital is quick and simple . 
Then the afternoon roams -LRB- ph -RRB- . 
Seven-month-old Minaj -LRB- ph -RRB- , so ill at the start of this week , is improving , as is Abdi -LRB- ph -RRB- . 
On the critical list for days , he 's now eating solid food . 
The work does n't pay well , but there are priceless rewards . 
-LRB- on camera -RRB- : Being a doctor though , as a human being , that 's just a magical moment . 
It 's very good . 
It 's something very -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to me . 
GEISSLER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Thirty years old , from a small town in the Kenyan highlands , John has learned fast he does n't just save lives , he brings them into the world , too . 
He delivered this baby yesterday across the compound in Hagadera 's maternity unit . 
Up to 80 children are born here each week . 
-LRB- on camera -RRB- : Dadaab is a hard place to start your life , is n't it ? 
KIOGORA : It is difficult . 
It 's a hard -LRB- ph -RRB- place , but this is the best for famine , because -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , and they get the care that you can give them . 
GEISSLER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : This evening , in the intensive care ward , Abdi Rahman -LRB- ph -RRB- is receiving that care . 
But his chances are still 50-50 . 
John and his team ca n't save everyone . 
The ward loses a couple of children most weeks . 
KIOGORA : I 've done my best to -- I mean , ca n't change the nature . 
I can only save the doomed and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- as far as medicine is concerned . 
GEISSLER : Another long day over , there 's a chance to reflect and prepare for whatever tomorrow might bring . 
STOUT : Martin Geissler reporting there . 
Now , the site , it has a wealth of information on how you can help , including links to reputable aid agencies working there in the region . 
Now , ahead on NEWS STREAM , the waters may have receded , but a lot of the damage still remains . 
We 'll see how Pakistan is coping one year on from its record flooding . 
STOUT : I 'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong . 
You 're watching News Stream . 
And these are your world headlines . 
Now U.S. lawmakers are still in gridlock over the government 's debt ceiling . 
Republican John Boehner , the U.S. House Speaker , had to scrap plans for a vote on his deficit cutting bill on Thursday . 
Not enough members of his own party supported it . 
Republicans may try again today . 
But even if the House passes the bill , Democrats who have the majority in the Senate have vowed to block it . 
Now Libya 's rebels have lost their army chief . 
General Abdul Fattah Younis was killed along with two officers . 
The circumstances of their death remain unclear . 
General Younis was Libya 's former Interior minister and Moammar Gadhafi 's second in command before switching sides in February . 
A woman who worked on the campaign with the no defunct News of the World after her daughter was murdered has learned that her phone may have been hacked . 
As Sarah Payne previously defended the newspaper . 
In its final addition she wrote that it was a force for good . 
And the only surviving gunman from the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai is challenging his death sentence . 
More than 160 people died in the three day coordinated attack . 
India 's supreme court says Mohammed Ajmal Kasab 's appeal was sent by authorities from the Mumbai jail where he is being held . 
And no date has been set for a hearing . 
Now police in Norway plan to interview this man , Ander Behring Breivik today for a second time . 
They say that investigators have gained new information since the last time they spoke to him . 
Now that was one day after last Friday 's terror attacks . 
Breivik has confessed to carrying out the shootings on Utoya Island as well as the bombing in Oslo . 
And he is currently in solitary confinement in a prison near Oslo . 
Now it is one week to the day since Breivik 's rampage left at least 76 people dead . 
And on this day a memorial service in central Oslo . 
The youth movement of the ruling Labor Party organized the event . 
And members were holding a summer camp on Utoya Island when Breivik began shooting them . 
Now the pictures you are watching were filmed at the service just a short time ago . 
In South Korea , rescue efforts go on , but the deluge just wo n't stop . 
The heaviest rains in a century have killed more than 50 people . 
Now outside Seoul people in five neighborhoods have been told to evacuate their homes . 
And most of those who died were overwhelmed by mudslides triggered by the rain . 
Now the country faces a daunting clean-up operation . 
Paula Hancocks has more . 
PAULA HANCOCKS , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : A huge amount has changed here in Seoul in just the last 24 hours . 
The sun is now shining , the weather has improved dramatically . 
And I brought you here to one of the inner city streams to show you just how radically the water levels have receded . 
On Thursday I would n't be able to stand on this bridge . 
There was a ferocious torrent of water that was coming down here . 
The paths on both sides were completely covered and the water levels were several feet higher . 
We 've also had confirmation this Friday of just how historic these floods were . 
Korea 's Meteorological Administration says that the past three days broke all records , 536 millimeters of rain fell , that 's more than 21 inches . 
And also Wednesday was the heaviest daily rainfall in July since records began . 
Now as well as the search and rescue operation , you are also seeing now the clean up operation . 
Volunteers are helping , the police , the military , civil service . 
There 's 34,000 people working on the clean up operation nationwide , 11,000 in Seoul alone . 
Politicians as well are also postponing their meetings so that they can be seen to be about and to be helping with the effort . 
One concern at an artillery unit on Mount Umyon . 
The Defense Ministry tells us at least 10 landmines are yet to be retrieved around this military base due to these landslides . 
But the administration also insists that concrete blocks have been set up to make sure that they ca n't fly down the mountain into the civilian areas . 
It is not just south Korea that has been affected , it is the entire Korean Peninsula . 
North Korea 's state media says that these storms have caused severe damage across the country . 
The state run television , KRT , is showing video of flooded areas , of damaged crops , and also a collapsed bridge in the southern Hwanghae Province just north of the border with South Korea . 
522 millimeters , or 20 inches of rain fell in 12 hours , according to KRT . 
We do n't yet have word on any possible casualties from North Korea . 
And it 's possible we wo n't hear word of possible casualties . 
Now the worst is certainly over for the Korean peninsula . 
The weather has been punishing over the past few days . 
And the intensity of these rains have surprised everybody . 
STOUT : Now one year ago a slow motion tsunami swept over Pakistan . 
That is how the United Nations chief described the devastating floods that covered nearly one-fifth of the country . 
And let 's show you how that looks over Europe . 
Now those waters killed 2,000 people and destroyed 1.6 million homes , a huge affected area . 
Now many people in Pakistan still are in dire need of help , but as Reza Sayah shows us , it is yet to arrive . 
REZA SAYAH , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Here in Pakistan you find poverty in a lot of places , but where we are right now this is probably the depths of poverty . 
In villages like Kut Almo -LRB- ph -RRB- in southern Sindh Province , the right kind of help never reaches children like Shulkit Ali -LRB- ph -RRB- , a 5 year old boy with symptoms of liver disease . 
But when Pakistan 's monster floods devastated the settlement one year ago , people here hoped the disaster would shed light on the wretched conditions they have suffered for years . 
They hoped help would finally come . 
But as a visit to Kut Almo -LRB- ph -RRB- makes clear , help has not come . 
Nothing for the past year . 
We 've had nothing , '' says Shulkit 's -LRB- ph -RRB- mother Sabbab Bajaj -LRB- ph -RRB- . 
The 2010 floods left one-fifth of Pakistan under water , an area roughly the size of Italy . 
Residence of Kut Almo -LRB- ph -RRB- were among the thousands rescued and taken to refugee camps where they waited for months for the floods to recede . 
Eventually they came back . 
Villagers here say over the past year at most three or four times aid workers have stopped by here , dropped off some building material and relief goods , but today they 're still going without some of the most basic needs to survive . 
`` What has the government given us ? '' 
Says Khatim Shah -LRB- ph -RRB- . 
`` They just gave us a little something to eat , but it 's gone . 
They have given us nothing . '' 
Many of the homes remain demolished here . 
Most of the water pumps still do n't work . 
There 's about 120 kids in this village and none of them go to school . 
And here 's why . 
This used to be their school and look at it . 
Destroyed by the flood waters a year ago , you can see some flood debris . 
This is Khatim Ali -LRB- ph -RRB- . 
That 's the flood line . 
He 's pointing to the flood line up there probably about 15 feet high . 
Most men here are farmers . 
The floods wiped away their land . 
Today many still do n't have jobs . 
Everywhere you look in this village there are signs of disease with no sign of medical help in a region with a history of neglect . 
A $ 20 vaccine would have probably saved Ishbak -LRB- ph -RRB- from polio when he was a baby , but today he 's a cripple living in this flood ravaged village . 
One year after Pakistan 's floods , aid groups say hundreds of thousands are still homeless . 
The UN 's appeal for $ 2 billion is not even three - quarters of a way to its goal . 
Shulkit Ali 's -LRB- ph -RRB- family hope the floods would showcase his medical condition for the world , but that has n't happened . 
With the media attention all but gone , his family asks if not now then when . 
Reza Sayah , CNN , Southern Sindh , Pakistan . 
STOUT : Let 's keep our focus on Pakistan and how that slow motion tsunami struck the country one year ago today . 
Our Mari Ramos is at the World Weather Center . 
She joins us now -- Mari . 
MARI RAMOS , CNN WEATHER CORRESPONDENT : Kristie , those images that Reza was showing us is really amazing . 
And I remember a year ago when we were covering this story how surprised we were to see all of that rain and how it just kept going and going and it would n't stop . 
Now you know that 's what we saw right now with South Korea , with Seoul , with all of that historic rainfall . 
Well , that 's kind of what happened in Pakistan , except the topography is different . 
And the rain did n't stop in Pakistan . 
Let me go ahead and show you first of all this image . 
Can -- oh , I guess you ca n't see it , I 'm sorry . 
Well , let 's go ahead and -- let me go ahead and show you kind of -- a little bit of an explainer of what actually happened here . 
First of all , the rainfall that happened on July 29 and 30 , that 's when we say that it started around this time . 
They had in 24 hours more than 270 millimeters of rain . 
Compare that to their monthly average right here . 
When they had all of this rain across this northern portion here of Pakistan . 
And then , it just continued to rain over the next few days , an all-time -- new all-time record was made around that time . 
70 percent above average rainfall in July , 104 percent above average as we headed into August . 
So this kind of kept going . 
When all of that water came along it came down from the mountains , it flooded the Indus River . 
It flooded the tributaries . 
And all of that happened very , very slowly . 
Areas continue to flood . 
Some areas dams failed and then you had flooding in areas that had never flooded before . 
And that crest continued to travel farther and farther to the south very , very slowly . 
I remember talking about that flood crest a week and two weeks and three weeks and four weeks after the flood still had not reached the sea , which was incredible . 
And then it took months for that water to continue going down . 
Right now at least over the last two weeks we 've had a little bit of above average rainfall across northern Pakistan . 
Below average rainfall in areas to the south . 
The southwest monsoon is in full swing right now . 
This is the rainy season again that we 're dealing with here . 
The heaviest rain has actually been across parts of India . 
In some cases over 200 millimeters of rain in areas particularly in the north . 
But , you know what , this is what we would expect . 
We have n't seen extreme amounts of rain like we did last year and certainly not in Pakistan . 
We 've had some bursts of some very heavy rain across portions of India , but overall the monsoon is right around where it should be for this time of year . 
Let 's go ahead and take a look at your forecast now . 
And talk about the differences from one country , from one area to the other . 
Paula Hancocks was just showing us from Seoul how the water had pretty much left the river and areas that she could n't be standing a couple of days ago are generally dry now , because of the topography there in Seoul , that water drained very quickly into the ocean . 
In Pakistan , it took months for that to happen . 
There you see the satellite image right now for the Korean peninsula . 
Much dryer now than it was just a few days ago . 
Some scattered rain showers expected . 
Some pop up thunderstorms on and off . 
Not out of the question over the next few days , probably a better chance as we head into late Sunday and into Monday , but we 're not expecting anything like what we saw in the last few days . 
So a little bit of good news there , Kristie . 
And finally , I do want to update you on Tropical Storm Nock-Ten . 
This is the one that moved first into the Philippines , then into the South China Sea . 
It 's one that gave you the typhoon 3 signal in Hong Kong for a little while yesterday . 
That signal is down . 
The storm actually made landfall in Hynan . 
And it is now moving into Vietnam . 
A lot of rainfall associated with this weather system . 
It should continue to weaken as it moves inland . 
I am concerned about the rain , though . 
We 'll watch it through the weekend here on CNN . 
STOUT : All right . 
Thank you and take care . 
And ahead here on News Stream , discovering the truth . 
Now secrets that were submerged underwater are now finally coming to light . 
We 'll have the latest on the investigation into the crash of Air France flight 447 . 
Now this is a 3D sketch up of the Air Fracen jet that tragically went down during a flight from Rio to Paris two years ago killing all 228 people on board . 
Now the details surrounding Air France flight 447 , including the cause of the crash , were largely a mystery until recently . 
Now just this past May , the French authority BEA recovered the plane 's flight recorders from the bottom of the Ocean . 
It has helped shape BEA 's third report that has just been released . 
Now Jim Bittermann joins us now live from Paris with more details . 
And Jim , walk us through the latest findings . 
JIM BITTERMANN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , basically this was the third but not the final report . 
The final report is expected at the end of the year . 
And basically with each one of these interim reports we 're finding out a little bit more about what happened in the final seconds of that ill fated flight . 
In this report , I think we 're beginning to see more and more fingers pointed at the crew . 
Basically the report said that the crew had had no training for this kind of high altitude stall that they faced . 
It also points out , however , that there were a lot of things happening at once . 
Some false indications coming in from the various parts of the aircraft equipment -- a stall warning horn going on and coming off and giving a bad indication of whether the plane had actually stalled . 
So pilots groups here , victims associations , and Air France are pushing back at the idea that the crew may have been to blame . 
In fact Air France said right after this report was issued a couple of hours ago , they said there 's no reason at this stage to question the crews technical skills . 
So as the Transport minister here said this morning , while these reports are giving more and more details of what happened , the actual blame for this crash , and of course there are million perhaps hundreds of millions of euros and dollars resting on the outcome in terms of the lawsuits involved , that the adjudication of any blame is going to wait for the courts . 
So basically these reports are interesting reading . 
They 're giving some indication . 
But like I said , a final report is due at the end of this year -- Kristie . 
STOUT : Now this is the third in four reports . 
What is the bottom line here , Jim . 
After going through all these reports , could the tragedy of Air France flight 447 been avoided if the pilots were better trained ? 
BITTERMANN : Well , that 's a good question . 
Well , the fact is they were getting a lot of contradictory information in a very short period of time . 
So they had to interpret the data that was coming into them . 
Now if they had interpreted correctly , and there had been other times when this kind of air speed indicator problem had cropped up , the other times when the crews had successfully managed the situation . 
They did n't in this case . 
And of course that will be the argument that 's at the crux of any kind of a court case . 
It certainly is the argument right now , because basically when blame is finally affixed , either by the accident investigators or by the courts as the Transport minister suggested -- when blame is affixed , then of course if it 's going to be Air Bus , the makers of the aircraft , or Air France who were providing the pilots and training the pilots , those are going to be libel for a lot of damages . 
So there 's going to be a lot of argument over exactly that point . 
Could it have been avoided ? 
It could have been avoided , of course , if the equipment had n't failed . 
It could have been avoided if the crew had performed better . 
But one way or the other , those are going to be the arguments that are going to come out in court -- Kristie . 
STOUT : All right . 
Jim Bittermann joining us live from Paris . 
And now to the latest twist in a scandal that has reached the highest levels of the UK . 
Now a mother who worked on a campaign with the now defunct News of the World tabloid after her daughter 's murder now says that her phone was hacked . 
Now senior international correspondent Dan Rivers is following the story in London . 
DAN RIVERS , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The official inquiry into phone hacking has been started by Lord Justice Brian Levenson in the building behind me . 
But only a few hours after he set out the sort of mechanics of how that long inquiry were run , there was another shocking allegation in the phone hacking scandal , the suggestion that Sarah Payne , the mother of the murdered 8 year old Sarah Payne , had her phone targeted by the News of the World . 
Now this is especially shocking , because Sarah Payne worked closely with the News of the World to campaign for greater information about pedophiles living in different areas and campaigned for the introduction of the so-called Sarah 's Law to give parents the right to know if a pedophile was living in their area . 
Indeed , she even wrote an article in the last addition of the News of the World saying News of the World proved that it is a force for good . 
In light of this suggestion that her phone may have been targeted by an investigator working for the paper , Sarah Payne 's agent put out a statement saying that she was devastated by the news . 
It went on , `` we are all deeply disappointed and are just working to get her through it . '' 
Rebekah Brooks , the former editor of the paper at the time , and the former chief executive of News International also put out a statement saying these allegations are abhorrent and particularly upsetting as Sarah Payne is a dear friend . 
The idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension . 
It 's an issue that Lord Justice Brian Leveson will no doubt look at as well as the wider issue of the ethics in journalism in the UK . 
And also allegations of a cozy and almost corrupt relationship between certain journalists and the police . 
STOUT : The story that does n't seem to end . 
You 're watching News Stream live on CNN . 
We 'll be back right after this . 
Now over the years people have been finding the face of Jesus in many objects , but now we are hearing about some divine vines . 
Jeanne Moos takes a closer look at the holy foliage . 
JEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Do you see just overgrown vines on a telephone pole or does this look the big operator in the sky ? 
MOOS : Now often these Jesus sightings require lots of imagination , whether it be Jesus on a moth , or Cheeto Jesus . 
MOOS : Even the famous Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese could arguably be Madonna . 
But this telephone pole in Middleton , Colorado strikes most people the same way . 
What do you see here ? 
MOOS : Folks pointed out what looks like a crown of thorns , the body 's positioning . 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Oh , and then look at the legs . 
Like , you know it 's like -- yeah . 
He 's like that . 
MOOS : But while you might think a telephone pole Jesus is pretty unique . 
It turns out he 's not alone . 
Vine covered utility poles have been sprouting religious images for years all over the country . 
MOOS : From North Carolina to Louisiana . 
That looks put there by him . 
MOOS : This one in Lake Charles , Louisiana from last fall was said to be most striking when seen as you drove by . 
And while one local was quoted as saying you ca n't spray Jesus with Roundup , workers did cut down the vines . 
Officials were worried believers would climb the pole to touch the greenery then get an electrifying jolt . 
Now if you 're having trouble seeing Jesus on telephone poles , maybe what you need is the Jesus pan . 
It 's supposed to put the image of Jesus right on food . 
Advertising for the Jesus pan says imagine serving heavenly hot cakes at the next church breakfast . 
Of course , the image of Jesus was much clearer when an episode of Glee focused on the topic . 
MOOS : Finn did n't just make the sandwich , he prayed to it . 
MOOS : Ca n't say that about a phone pole that looks like a holy Chia pet . 
MOOS : But what is he saying . 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : He 's saying call your mother . 
STOUT : Now shares of Nintendo , they plunged around 20 percent on Friday . 
And that was its biggest fall in the last two decades . 
And it shows how worried investors are about the company 's direction . 
Now Nintendo had been enjoying plenty of success with the Wii . 
Now unlike the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 , the Wii did not offer the latest high definition graphics , but instead used that revolutionary controller that sensed your movements . 
But Wii sales have slowed , so Nintendo pinned their hopes on a new console , the 3DS . 
Now it is a handheld that can display 3D without the need for special glasses , but it has n't quite caught on with consumers . 
Now Nintendo has sold only 710,000 now forcing it to cut prices by 40 percent in Japan , over 30 percent in the U.S. Nintendo needs a boost and soon . 
So this is the company 's latest console . 
It 's called the Wii U. And it 's not due until the middle of next year . 
Now we will have much more business news just ahead on World Business Today . 
That is it for News Stream .

2011-07-29,"People carry the coffin of Libya 's rebel military commander Abdel Fattah Younes during his burial in Benghazi July 29 , 2011 . 
BENGHAZI , Libya | Fri Jul 29 , 2011 6:58 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels said on Friday the gunmen who shot dead the rebel military chief were fighters of an allied militia , in apparent confirmation of deep rifts among the forces struggling to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi . 
The reports follow 24 hours of confusion over the killing of Abdel Fattah Younes , a defector from Gaddafi 's inner circle , whose death deals a blow both to the rebels and their Western backers . 
There had been widespread speculation as to whether Younes had been killed in an internal rebel feud or by Gaddafi forces which had penetrated the Benghazi-based movement . 
The killing of such a senior figure was a setback for the rebels as they were winning broader international recognition and launching an offensive in the west , and has deepened fears that divisions within the rebel camp will prolong the conflict . 
Rebel minister Ali Tarhouni told reporters in Benghazi that an allied militia leader who had gone to fetch Younes from the front line had been arrested and had confessed that his subordinates had carried out the killing . 
`` It was not him . 
His lieutenants did it , '' Tarhouni said , without giving details about the militia . 
He added that the killers were still at large . 
Rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said on Thursday Younes had been recalled for questioning to Benghazi but was killed before he arrived . 
Relatives said they retrieved a burned and bullet-riddled body . 
The rebels have seized swathes of the country , but five months into the rebellion still appear far from ousting Gaddafi and remain poorly equipped . 
Speculation about the assassination of Younes ranged widely . 
There were reports that he had been suspected of feeding the Gaddafi camp with information . 
One rebel commander said Islamists whom Younes had targeted in his job as interior minister may have been to blame . 
The United States , which like some 30 other nations has formally recognized the opposition , said Younes 's death was a blow but called for solidarity among the rebels . 
`` What 's important is that they work both diligently and transparently to ensure the unity of the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington . 
On Friday , weeping relatives and supporters brought Younes 's coffin into the main square of Benghazi to mourn him , as fighters fired guns in the air . 
Some family members vowed allegiance to the rebels ' political leader . 
`` A message to Mustafa Abdel Jalil : We will walk with you all the way , '' nephew Mohammed Younes told hundreds of mourners in the main square . 
Younes , from eastern Libya where the rebels are strongest , had been Gaddafi 's interior minister but switched sides to become the military chief in the rebel Transitional National Council . 
Rebel defense minister Omar Hariri , visiting the west , said Younes 's death would have an impact on rebel fighters . 
`` But they will recover , and there will be other leaders , '' he said . 
Rebels took swathes of Libya soon after launching their uprising in February against Gaddafi 's 41 years of domination of the oil-producing North African state , but have made few recent advances despite the support of NATO air strikes . 
They said they had seized several towns in the Western Mountains on Thursday but are yet to make a major breakthrough . 
A rebel commander near Ghezaia told Reuters on Friday that around 100 insurgents had taken control of the town , from which Gaddafi forces had dominated plains below the mountains . 
Reuters could not go there to confirm the report as rebels said the area could be mined . 
But through binoculars from a rebel-held ridge near Nalut , reporters could see no sign of Gaddafi 's forces in Ghezaia . 
Fighters on the front line near the town of Misrata said they viewed Younes as a martyr and would avenge his death . 
`` It will be an extra motive for us in the fight against the tyrant , '' said Khaled al-Uwayyib . 
With prospects fading for a negotiated settlement , the five-month-old civil war will grind on into the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in August . 
Nick Witney , analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Paris , said the West had hoped for a `` nice simple conflict '' with right prevailing , but this had ignored the nuanced , tribal nature of Libyan politics . 
`` It was a brave and right thing to do , '' he said . 
`` But I feel we 've lost the moral high ground a bit and wandered into something that will be prolonged and messy , but we 're not in a position to sort out . '' 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It was the first time the alliance has done so for rebels in the west , said the commanders . 
A NATO spokesman said that if any surveillance imagery had been given to the rebels , then it had come from an individual member country , and not from the alliance itself . 
No wonder they did well today . 
They had a map showing where to atack and where the Pro Gaddafi supporters was . 
Is n't UN\/NATO there to save lives not to help kill people ? 
But i guess that the supporters of Gaddafi have no right to support him and have no right to life . 
Is that how democracy is supposed to be ? 
He served Gaddafi for over 3 decades , he did not have a chance of survival . 
Surprised he lasted this long with the opposition . 
Stop calling these ragtags `` rebels '' they are nothing more than a bunch of criminal that will sell all of Libya to the west for cash ... This discussion is now closed .

2011-07-30,"By Joe Sterling and Ivan Watson , CNN Details murky on Libya rebel chief death NEW : Younis ' killing is `` more proof that the transitional council of the traitors is not able to lead , '' says Ibrahim The death of the top rebel commander in Libya stokes speculation of a rebel rift An ex-ambassador says `` revenge by Tripoli '' is the `` most likely scenario '' One expert says the death is a reminder of the rebel coalition 's fragility Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The killing on Thursday of the top rebel military commander shows that those forces are in disarray , a spokesman for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said Friday . 
Gen. Abdul Fattah Younis and two other rebels were killed after the country 's main rebel organization , the Transitional National Council , sought to question him about military matters and allegations that he or those close to him had ongoing ties to Gadhafi , Younis ' supporters said . 
Younis ' killing represents `` more proof that the transitional council of the traitors is not able to lead any sort of government or have any control of eastern cities of Libya , '' said Musa Ibrahim , the Gadhafi spokesman . 
Ibrahim accused two members of al Qaeda of having arrested Younis with the help of the Transitional National Council and subsequently charging Younis with treason for `` betraying the cause . '' 
But the abductors knew that a fair trial would have been lengthy and that Younis ' tribe would have intervened to help him , so they killed him , Ibrahim said . 
`` He was shot and his body was immediately disfigured , '' he added . 
The killing shows that `` al Qaeda is the real power among the rebels , '' he said , repeating Gadhafi 's assertion that rebel forces are allied with al Qaeda . 
`` They have the most soldiers ; they have the training ; they have the weapons ; they have the faith -- a wicked faith ; they have the strategies . '' 
The killing also sends a powerful message to other tribes : `` Try to exclude us from your settlement , your political settlement , and this is your fate , '' Ibrahim said . 
Younis was killed along with a colonel and a lieutenant colonel , the Transitional National Council said in a prepared statement . 
No further details were immediately released . 
Mohammad Ethish , a member of a rebel military council , released a statement that seemed to imply that Gadhafi loyalists had something to do with the death . 
`` This incident will increase the will and courage of the rebels , and it will even get us close together to reach the home of the tyrant , '' Ethish said . 
`` We promise our brothers in the East that we will do the impossible to avenge the death of Abdul Fattah Younis , and we promise that we will increase our blows and empower our will . 
Until we capture the tyrant Moammar Gadhafi . '' 
The deaths have provoked questions and stirred speculation that they might cause a rift among opposition leaders . 
`` We really do n't know what happened yet , '' said Marina Ottaway , senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 's Middle East program . 
`` Politically , it 's a reminder of how tenuous a coalition it is . '' 
Rebels have been battling government troops in a fight to oust Gadhafi , who has ruled the North African nation for nearly 42 years . 
NATO has used air power to enforce a U.N. resolution protecting civilians from the regime , and world powers have announced their support for Libya 's rebel umbrella group . 
This week , the United Kingdom joined the United States and other Western powers in recognizing the TNC as the legitimate governing authority in Libya , a decision that could steer millions of dollars to the opposition . 
Younis had served as interior minister in Gadhafi 's government until February , when he defected to the Benghazi-based rebel movement . 
A onetime general in Gadhafi 's army , Younis told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to bomb Benghazi -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands . 
A young man in a tan uniform who spoke in Benghazi after Friday Muslim prayers said on rebel TV that Younis `` was assassinated by him like the other martyrs of Libya '' and called for `` revenge for everyone who took part in this crime . '' 
It was n't clear whom he was implicating in Younis ' death . 
The man said that `` knowing the truth of what happened to him and avenging his death is a debt every Libyan man and woman owes . 
My message to Mustafa Abdel Jalil is we will be with you on this path , '' the man said , referring to the leader of the rebels ' government . 
Alistair Burt , the British Foreign Office 's minister for the Middle East and North Africa , said , `` Exactly what happened remains unclear . '' 
He added that the `` killing will be thoroughly investigated . '' 
`` We agreed that it is important that those responsible are held to account through proper judicial processes . '' 
Sir Richard Dalton , a former British ambassador to Libya and associate fellow for the Middle East and North Africa Programme of the London-based Chatham House , said `` one scenario is revenge by Tripoli . '' 
However , Dalton said , the ultimate impact of the killing on the opposition movement will depend on the facts that emerge about the killing . 
`` They 've been promising it for a while , '' he said of the Gadhafi government . 
`` Right from the start , they 've threatened people who 've turned away . 
There are stories that AFY -LRB- Younis -RRB- had rebuffed approaches by Tripoli . '' 
There have been tensions between different parts of the opposition forces , Dalton said . 
So a `` second hypothesis '' is that a quarrel got `` out of hand . 
But he warned not to jump to conclusions about the significance of a `` single episode . '' 
`` We have n't got much to go on , '' he said . 
`` I think our governments will find out soon . '' 
Ottaway , the Carnegie Endowment scholar , said the killing raises questions about the rebel council . 
`` It 's clear there are divisions '' within the Transitional National Council , she said . 
`` There are suspicions of some of the people who went from being close allies -LRB- of Gadhafi -RRB- , as Younis was , to joining '' the rebels . 
The motives of those who switched sides have been questioned by people who were n't sure whether they had truly made the transition or were just pretending to have changed . 
There has been speculation , she said , that Younis might have been dealing somehow with Gadhafi . 
`` The main point perhaps is that the unity at the Transitional National Council is tenuous at best . 
This is a strange coalition at best , '' she said . 
`` They are very aware of the fact that they are not an organization that represents the entire country . '' 
As for how the killing might affect the rebels ' military effort , Ottaway said it 's not clear how much control Younis had . 
She pointed out that the killing occurred on the same day rebels embarked on an offensive in western Libya . 
The fighters said their forces captured five towns and surrounded a sixth in the plains below the Nafusa mountain range , which borders Tunisia . 
Mark Quarterman , a senior adviser and director of the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies ' Program on Crisis , Conflict and Cooperation , said the `` potential implications '' of the death are `` very worrisome '' and could help the Gadhafi regime in the short run . 
The death has had the effect of `` roiling rebel politics , '' Quarterman said . 
The killing has fomented anger among members of Younis ' Obeidi tribe , according to news reports . 
Quarterman , an expert on the Libyan crisis , said the killing undermines the bet NATO powers have made that , by enforcing the U.N. resolution protecting Libyans , they would give rebels space to defeat Gadhafi forces . 
Quarterman noted that Younis had been engaged in a dispute with another rebel commander , Khalifa Hifter . 
`` They seem unable to take and hold territory . 
This makes things worse , '' Quarterman said . 
`` You ca n't have a lot of faith and confidence in forces saying , ` I 'm the commander , no I 'm the commander . ' 
`` If this disarray does continue , this only benefits Gadhafi . 
And it makes the coming of a post-Gadhafi Libya that much more distant . '' 
There has been talk among world powers about negotiated settlements and scenarios that could include Gadhafi remaining in Libya after the conflict ends , Quarterman said . 
The international sense that the conflict would end quickly with `` capitulation on the part of the Gadhafi regime is fading , '' Quarterman said . 
`` As a result , the end game is seeming much more murky . ''

2011-07-30,"MISRATA\/TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- In rebel-held Misrata , the vegetable market is half empty ; shoppers fret over shortages and soaring prices . 
A few miles away in Zlitan , controlled by Muammar Gaddafi , Libyans worry about sanctions and NATO strikes . 
As Libya 's civil war churns on into Ramadan with no end in sight , Libyans on both sides of the conflict say shortages , high prices , rising summer temperatures and worry about loved ones fighting on distant fronts could mar the Muslim fasting month . 
`` A few hours ago NATO conducted a precision airstrike that disabled three ground-based Libyan state TV satellite transmission dishes in Tripoli , '' NATO spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie said . 
BENGHAZI\/TRIPOLI , July 29 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- As mourners carried the body the slain Libyan rebel military chief to his funeral , fighters fresh from the front unleashed volleys of gunfire into the air and vowed Abdul Fattah Younes had not died in vain . 
Far away from the grieving rebel stronghold Benghazi , supporters of Muammar Gaddafi , whose 41-year rule the rebels are struggling to end , Tripoli residents on Friday said the man they labeled a traitor merely got what he deserved . 
TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi shows no sign of giving any ground as rebels win wider recognition abroad , so , with no breakthrough likely in the war , a stalemate looks set to extend well into the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . 
If anything , diplomatic efforts to end the five-month conflict may have been further complicated by rifts emerging between the rebels and their Western allies over whether or not Gaddafi could stay in the country even if he stood down .

TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- A U.N envoy trying to find a way to end the war in Libya said after talks with the prime minister in Tripoli on Tuesday that the government and the rebels remained far apart in the drive for an end to the crisis . 
The government told him NATO must end air strikes before any talks could begin and that Muammar Gaddafi 's role as leader was non-negotiable , though rebels and the West insist he step down . 
TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Efforts to find a deal to end the civil war in Libya intensified on Tuesday , with a U.N. special envoy heading for Tripoli and Western powers signaling that Muammar Gaddafi could stay in the country if he gives up power . 
U.N. envoy Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who visited the rebels in Benghazi on Monday , is looking for a `` political process '' that will end a war that has failed to dislodge Gaddafi despite months of rebel attacks backed by NATO bombing raids . 
TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Explosions rocked central Tripoli for the second night in a row and Britain said weeks of NATO bombardment had inflicted extensive damage on Muammar Gaddafi 's heavily-fortified compound . 
Libya 's leader is clinging to power despite a four-month-old NATO air campaign and a lengthening conflict with rebels seeking an end to his 41-year rule and who have seized large swathes of the North African country . 
TRIPOLI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- Libya is ready to hold more talks with the United States and with rebels trying to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi , but the Libyan leader will not bow to demands he quit , a government spokesman said . 
Moussa Ibrahim said Libyan officials had a `` productive dialogue '' with U.S. counterparts last week in a rare meeting that followed American recognition of the rebel government that hopes to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule .

2011-07-30,"Libyans face Ramadan of shortages , fear as war drags on By Mussab Al Khairallah and Missy Ryan MISRATA\/TRIPOLI | Sat Jul 30 , 2011 11:01 am EDT MISRATA\/TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - In rebel-held Misrata , the vegetable market is half empty ; shoppers fret over shortages and soaring prices . 
A few miles away in Zlitan , controlled by Muammar Gaddafi , Libyans worry about sanctions and NATO strikes . 
As Libya 's civil war churns on into Ramadan with no end in sight , Libyans on both sides of the conflict say shortages , high prices , rising summer temperatures and worry about loved ones fighting on distant fronts could mar the Muslim fasting month . 
Misrata 's market is just a collection of makeshift stalls , built after the original market was destroyed in fighting . 
Given that Misrata is marooned in the Gaddafi-held west and only able to bring in supplies by sea , locals are resigned to shortages . 
`` Dates do not have a long shelf life . 
Our best dates are in the south , '' said Mohammed Abu Zreeba of the high-energy fruit popular among Muslims breaking the dawn-to-dusk fast . 
`` This is far from us and can not reach us by sea . 
Cars and transportation can not get here . '' 
Just a few miles west of Misrata , in the Gaddafi-held town of Zlitan , locals said sanctions and air strikes were biting . 
The Libyan government recently bussed foreign journalists to Zlitan to see what they said were government food warehouses it said were struck by planes from NATO , which says it strikes only military targets . 
Sacks of flour and rice and boxes of canned tomatoes and oil that were destined to be sold to Libyans at reduced prices were burned or sat surrounded by rubble . 
`` We use this food for Ramadan and now it is destroyed , '' nearby resident Mohamed Muftah said angrily . 
`` They want to starve us . '' 
Rebels fighting in the Western Mountains region , near Libya 's border with Tunisia , were worried about fighting without food and water in the searing heat . 
`` Ramadan will be very tough for us . 
We 're already struggling now . 
The weather will be very hot and we wo n't have the energy to fight while we are fasting , '' said Abdelbadr Adel , 19 , a rebel fighting in the Western Mountains . 
`` It is now more important than ever that NATO help us beat Gaddafi . 
We know Gaddafi 's men will not be fasting . '' 
The United Nations has warned of fuel and cash shortages on the eve of Ramadan , when families and friends typically gather to break their fast together with hearty meals . 
Long petrol lines snake down highways near the capital Tripoli . 
Ahmed al-Kafi , a retired diplomat who lives in the city of Sabratha west of Tripoli , said the fuel shortage would prevent him from visiting relatives and friends as he would normally do . 
Gaddafi 's finance minister , Abdulhafid Zlitni , told CNN earlier this month that the government was providing subsidies to control costs and fixing prices of basic foodstuffs . 
Zlitni said the country still has significant `` contingency reserves , ' but it was not clear how long the government , unable to access assets frozen abroad , could afford such support . 
Abdussalam bin Sulaiman , a Libyan journalist , said Ramadan this year would be overshadowed by the air strikes that rock Tripoli and other areas virtually every day . 
`` We hope but that by the time Eid al-Fitr comes around , this obsession with death will be finished , '' he said , referring to the feast that marks the end of the fast .

2011-07-31,"By Ivan Watson and Jomana Karadsheh , CNN This photo of Tripoli was taken during a guided government tour on July 22 during a pro-Col . 
One man says quietly , `` We 're barely staying alive '' Muslim cleric says government troops can break fast to fight Officials say they expect a bloody holiday month Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Last-minute shopping before the start of the Muslim month of Ramadan brought back bustle and commercial activity to the center of a city that is increasingly showing strain from Libya 's grinding civil war . 
In downtown Tripoli , cars were backed up in traffic jams . 
Shoppers lined up outside a bakery waiting for bread . 
Not far away , another line of residents stood next to an ATM machine , waiting for their turn to withdraw cash . 
The busy scene on Sunday was a sharp contrast to previous government-sponsored tours of the city , which revealed rows of shuttered shops and streets largely devoid of traffic . 
Asked about how the civil war is likely to impact the imminent month of fasting and feasting , many Tripoli residents insisted they were not facing any hardships whatsoever . 
`` Mia mia ! '' 
said housewife Aisha Rajab , repeating a popular Libyan phrase that roughly translates to `` 100 % . '' 
`` Everything is good , '' she added , as she shopped with her sisters and nieces for food . 
`` Everything is available and at cheap prices ... we are hoping for victory for our leader -LRB- Moammar Gadhafi -RRB- ! '' 
Libyan leader 's cult of personality Rift in Libya rebels rank ? 
Details murky on Libya rebel chief death UK expels Libyan Embassy staff However , when a government guide was out of earshot , a Libyan man had a dramatically different assessment of the situation . 
`` We 're barely staying alive , '' said the man , who spoke discreetly and asked not to be named , due to what he claimed were large numbers of secret police and security forces operating in the immediate vicinity . 
`` Have n't you seen the fuel lines ? '' 
Long lines of parked cars snake through the city next to gas stations , where drivers sometimes wait days to buy gas . 
Huge piles of garbage have started to accumulate on streets , parks and beaches due to the departure of armies of guest workers who often fulfilled basic municipal duties . 
A gleaming , recently constructed Marriott hotel stands empty on one of Tripoli 's sea fronts , a symbol of the burst of foreign investment that was frozen after the conflict erupted last February . 
The NATO-enforced blockade of seaports and airports controlled by Gadhafi 's forces have severely disrupted trade , forcing Tripoli to rely largely on food and fuel trucked in from neighboring Tunisia . 
Earlier in July , the United Nations published a report warning about `` pockets of vulnerability '' in Tripoli and other Gadhafi-controlled cities . 
A U.N. humanitarian team reported seeing shortages of cash , medicine , and fuel . 
The besieged Gadhafi regime has acknowledged the growing hardship . 
In an interview several weeks ago with CNN , the finance and planning minister in Tripoli announced his government had begun pumping in `` large amounts of funds '' to drive down growing war-time prices of basic consumer goods like rice , flour , meat , eggs , sugar and edible oils . 
These measures appear to have helped Libyans preparing for a month of fast-breaking iftar feasts . 
`` Everything we need is available . 
There has been a slight increase in prices , very small increase , '' said an elderly retired engineer named Milad Omar . 
Harder to evaluate is the impact the conflict is having on the collective Libyan psyche . 
Regime officials strictly control the movements and conversations of foreign journalists . 
And after 42 years of strict Gadhafi rule , Libyans often appear visibly uncomfortable speaking openly about their situation . 
But on a recent visit to the market in Tripoli 's central Abu Salim neighborhood , CNN journalists met two families who said they had recently fled fighting in the nearby Nafusa mountains to the southwest of the capital . 
`` We woke up to shelling , '' said Mabouka Hassem . 
Her town of Al Josh came under attack from rebel fighters on Thursday morning , she said . 
`` We never expected it . 
Our neighbors who live in the hills above us attacked us . '' 
Hassem said she and her sister and their children fled crying and screaming , some barefoot . 
They arrived in Tripoli on Friday . 
`` We left with only the clothes on our back , '' said Nuri Mohamed Ali , a man who said he fled with his children from Gawalish , another front-line town , two weeks ago . 
He walked through the market with two of his children , shopping ahead of what is supposed to be a month focused on faith , spirituality and reflection . 
Officials in Tripoli have been preparing for what they say will be a bloody Ramadan . 
At a recent gathering in support of Gadhafi , a Muslim cleric told CNN that loyalist troops would be authorized to break their daytime fasts to fight on the front lines . 
`` Those who are fasting , if they get thirsty they should break their fast . 
-LRB- Because -RRB- those who are fighting are Mujahedeen -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- , '' said Mohammed Madani Chouairef . 
`` Everyone standing up to this sedition is a Mujahed except for those who are with NATO . '' 
`` It is very bad to fight against other Muslims during Ramadan , '' said Moussa Ibrahim , Gadhafi 's main spokesman . 
`` But it -LRB- Ramadan -RRB- makes us stronger , '' he added . 
Late Sunday night , hours before the official start of Ramadan , Tripoli shook with the sound of several explosions . 
NATO warplanes roared overhead .

2011-07-31,"GHAZAIA , Libya , July 31 | Sun Jul 31 , 2011 2:27 pm EDT GHAZAIA , Libya , July 31 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels who seized the government-held town of Ghazaia in Libya 's Western Mountain in a new offensive describe themselves as `` liberators '' , but there were no cheers when they rolled in . 
Its estimated 5,000 residents , supporters of Muammar Gaddafi , had been transported to his stronghold Tripoli by his militiamen , leaving behind a ghost town . 
`` We would have liked to have been welcomed here . 
These people all liked Gaddafi . 
They benefitted from him , '' said a rebel named Majdi , standing beside rows of houses built by Libyans aided by soft loans from the government . 
Libya 's six-month uprising is often described as a simple struggle to end decades of autocratic rule . 
But as the offensive in the Western Mountains illustrates , it is far more complex . 
Factionalism could fuel a civil war , even if Gaddafi falls , keeping the North African oil producer unstable . 
`` I just hope that we can oust Gaddafi and that his followers will let the past be the past and embrace democracy , '' said rebel Omar Ali Muhammad . 
`` Otherwise the country may face troubles even if he is pushed out . '' 
Gaddafi maintained supporters in Ghazaia and other places in the plains below the Western Mountains , despite international pressure on him to step down and defections of senior government officials . 
That is one reason why it took rebels , themselves disunited , months to make serious gains here . 
The veteran Libyan leader 's support network could also enable him to launch a counteroffensive and reverse rebel gains . 
While his opponents were still gaining military experience , Gaddafi was relying on residents of the rough desert region to give him further advantages over a novice rebel force . 
One provided his militiamen with extensive services . 
`` He gave Gaddafi 's soldiers everything . 
Intelligence on our movements , details on the routes we used , he even gave them sheep and goats , '' said rebel commander Salim al Hamdi , who was discussing strategy with comrades at the man 's house , which has been taken over by rebels . 
Government forces had been dug in at Ghazaia since the conflict began , setting up headquarters at a complex of houses the government helped people build . 
Soldiers also lived in villas , enjoying kitchens , television sets and radio . 
Now rebels are surrounding the town of Tiji , which also supports Gaddafi . 
On Sunday afternoon rebels on the frontline fired tank shells and anti-aircraft guns at government forces . 
`` They like Gaddafi in Tiji , '' said a rebel named Osama as missiles were fired back , pounding the earth . 
`` After Gaddafi loses we will remember that the people of Tiji loved him . 
That 's why it 's tough fighting here . 
It is a reality . '' 
Another fighter who overheard quickly rushed over to correct him . 
No everything will be fine . 
Libya will be stable , '' he said nervously .

2011-07-31,"Libyan rebel fighters sit on a ridge near a tank shell after overrunning a government army position in the village of Hawamid in western Libya , July 30 , 2011 . 
BENGHAZI , Libya | Sun Jul 31 , 2011 12:41 am BST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels say the gunmen who shot dead their military chief were militiamen allied in their struggle to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi , raising questions about divisions and lawlessness within rebel ranks . 
The assassination of Abdel Fattah Younes , apparently by his own side , has hurt the opposition just as it was winning broader international recognition and launching an offensive against Gaddafi 's forces in the Western Mountains . 
After 24 hours of confusion , rebel minister Ali Tarhouni said Younes had been killed by fighters who were sent to fetch him from the front and his bullet-riddled and partially burnt body was found at a ranch near the rebel capital of Benghazi . 
Tarhouni said late on Friday a militiaman had been arrested and confessed that his subordinates had carried out the killing . 
Younes had been part of Gaddafi 's inner circle since the 1969 coup that brought the Libyan colonel to power and was interior minister before defecting to the rebels in February . 
Many rebels had been uncomfortable working under a man who had been so close to Gaddafi for 41 years , and rebel sources said on Thursday Younes had been recalled over suspicions he or his family were secretly in contact with the Libyan leader . 
Rebels were divided over who had killed Younes , some suspecting his execution was ordered by rebel leaders for treason , many believing he was killed by Gaddafi supporters who had infiltrated rebel ranks , and still others suggesting a rebel splinter group had acted alone . 
Gaddafi 's government pointed the finger at Fawzi Bu Kitf , head of the Union of Revolutionary Forces , a federation of armed rebel groups operating in the east of the country . 
In an apparent effort to distance himself from the killing , Bu Kitf on Saturday named the key suspect as Mustafa al-Rubh , the field commander who had been dispatched to arrest Younes . 
`` He is a member of the Union as an individual , '' Bu Kitf told reporters . 
`` Whatever was done was done through his own idea . '' 
Whatever the truth , the killing deepens concerns among the rebels ' Western backers , keen to see them prevail in a five-month-old civil war but frustrated by their lack of unity and nervous about the influence of Islamists . 
The United States , which like some 30 other nations has formally recognized the opposition , called for solidarity . 
`` What 's important is that they work both diligently and transparently to ensure the unity of the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington . 
Rebels who rose up against Gaddafi in February have seized swathes of the country but remain poorly equipped and are still far from ousting him , despite support from NATO airstrikes . 
Rebels said on Saturday they had encircled Gaddafi 's last stronghold in the Western Mountains and hoped to seize it soon . 
Rebel tanks fired at Tiji , where some 500 government troops are stationed . 
`` We have Tiji surrounded and we hope to take it by the end of the day , '' rebel commander Nasir al-Hamdi , a former police colonel , told Reuters as gunfire crackled in the distance . 
Rebels also made a new push on the front just west of the rebel-held city of Misrata . 
Hospital sources said 12 rebels were killed and 60 wounded in fighting that rebels said took them to the edge of Zlitan , the largest city between Misrata and the capital Tripoli to the west . 
`` Most of the casualties today were from GRAD missiles and mortar fire . 
We have advanced well and God willing we will be in Zlitan soon , '' said Ibrhaim Buwathi , 24 . 
NATO strikes also continued in western Libya overnight . 
NATO said early on Saturday it had bombed three satellite dishes in Tripoli to stop `` terror broadcasts '' by Gaddafi , but Libyan state TV remained on air and condemned what it said was the targeting of journalists . 
As Libya 's civil war grinds on into Ramadan with no end in sight , Libyans on both sides of the conflict say shortages , high prices , rising summer temperatures and worry about loved ones fighting on distant fronts could mar the Muslim fasting month . 
`` Ramadan will be very tough for us . 
We 're already struggling now . 
The weather will be very hot and we wo n't have the energy to fight while we are fasting , '' said Abdelbadr Adel , 19 , a rebel fighting in the Western Mountains . 
In the east , confusion reigned over who had killed Younes . 
Rebel fighters said members of the February 17 Martyrs ' Brigade , a rebel group that is part of the Union of Revolutionary Forces , had collected Younes from the frontline near Brega on Thursday . 
However , Tarhouni , the rebel minister , said it was another militia , the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade , who had killed Younes . 
Locals said the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade mainly comprised former prisoners of Gaddafi 's notorious Abu Salim prison in the capital Tripoli , who had always distrusted Younes . 
Obaid Ibn Jarrah Brigade was not a member of the Union , which is employed by the Transitional National Council for security . 
Named after one of the companions of Islam 's Prophet Mohammad , the group is likely to have Islamist leanings . 
One rebel commander , who asked not to be named , said Islamists whom Younes had targeted as interior minister may have killed him in retaliation . 
`` Some of those Islamists are now fighting with the rebels and they have always refused to fight under Younes 's command and have always viewed him with suspicion , '' he said . 
`` I do n't think the investigation will lead anywhere . 
They do n't dare to touch the Islamists . '' 
Further complicating an already murky situation , some Libyans said they feared that Younes ' death would trigger a bloody tribal feud . 
But in an apparent effort to calm nerves , a rebel source said Younes could be replaced by Suleiman Mahmoud al-Obeidi , a member of the same tribe . 
The longer the war drags on , the further eastern Libya appears to slip into lawlessness , raising questions about what kind of Libya could emerge if Gaddafi goes . 
Tarhouni told reporters on Friday night a gang had attacked a prison using rocket-propelled grenades , helping about 300 former Gaddafi soldiers and loyalists to escape .

2011-08-01,"From Elise Labott and Jill Dougherty , CNN Libyan rebels carry the coffin of assassinated Army Chief Abdel Fatah Younis on July 29 in Benghazi , Libya . 
NEW : Gadhafi 's son : `` Whether NATO stays or not , the battle will continue until Libya is freed '' The U.S. prepares to hand over the Libyan embassy in Washington to the rebels The Transitional National Council has been rocked by internal divisions Last week the TNC 's military commander was mysteriously assassinated Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Even as it prepares to hand over the Libyan embassy in Washington to the rebel government , the State Department is warning the Transitional National Council to get its act together . 
An administration official told CNN the United States has warned the TNC that this is a `` do-or-die moment '' for the organization to carry out a credible and thorough investigation of the killing of its military commander , Abdel Fatah Younis . 
Last week 's mysterious assassination has raised concerns that it might have been carried out by feuding groups within the rebels themselves . 
`` We do welcome the Transitional National Council 's move to set up an impartial committee that will investigate the incident and we look forward to hearing the results , '' deputy spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Monday . 
`` It 's important that , given the fluidness of the situation on the ground , that the Transitional National Council work to ensure that it takes the right kinds of actions , such as an investigation into the death , and sends a clear and transparent message that they speak on behalf of the Libyan opposition and the Libyan people and that they are diligently carrying out their mandate . '' 
The TNC has been rocked by internal divisions , with rival rebel groups battling each other . 
The divisions create a dilemma for the Obama administration , which recognized the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya 's rightful government on July 15 at an international meeting on Libya in Istanbul . 
The move , done in coordination with the international community , paves the way for the United States to reopen the embassy , accredit diplomats and unfreeze billions of dollars in frozen assets . 
The internal strife within the rebel movement comes as the State Department prepares to hand over the Libyan embassy to the TNC as the recognized government of Libya , according to U.S. officials . 
The officials say the move would allow the TNC to re-open the embassy , accredit diplomats and regain control of the embassy 's frozen bank account , worth about $ 13 million . 
Rift in Libya rebels rank ? 
Details murky on Libya rebel chief death It follows a formal request from the TNC to re-open the embassy under its control and accredit Ali Aujali , the former Libyan ambassador to the United States , as its charge d'affaires . 
In March , the State Department ordered the Libyan embassy in Washington closed and kicked diplomats loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi out of the country . 
Aujali had resigned his post as the regime 's ambassador to the United States in February and has since represented the opposition in Washington . 
`` We are consulting with the National Transitional Council on a broad range of issues , and that includes diplomatic accreditation and representation , '' Toner said . 
Despite the divisions within the TNC , the State Department publicly expressed confidence in the rebels . 
`` We believe that this is the legitimate representatives of the Libyan people during this transition period , '' Toner said . 
`` This is an extremely challenging period for Libya and they are dealing with these challenges as they come . 
But we have confidence that they can weather this . '' 
But privately , U.S. officials acknowledge there is some concern about the apparent disarray within the rebel movement , although officials say it is not surprising . 
`` This is a tribal society , '' one official said . 
`` We knew from the start this could be messy and there was always the concern about not moving too fast . 
We had no illusions about the TNC , but they have done a pretty good job and look better to us than Gadhafi at this point . '' 
NATO has been bombing Libya for more than four months under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from troops loyal to Gadhafi , who is battling a rebellion that has claimed control of the eastern half of the country . 
The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was shuttered and American personnel evacuated by sea and air in late February , after the current revolt against Gadhafi erupted . 
Libyan and U.S. officials held face-to-face talks in Tunisia last month , but Washington says the sole point of the meeting was to repeat its demand that Gadhafi `` must go . '' 
Also Sunday , state TV aired video of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , Gadhafi 's son , speaking to what was described as displaced families . 
He has not been seen speaking in public for weeks . 
`` Whether NATO stays or not , the battle will continue until Libya is freed , '' he said , stressing the right of people to fight . 
`` Let me say to you that the battle will not stop . 
Every one of you : return to your homes and farms and villages and jobs with peace of mind . 
We will not stop ! ''

2011-08-03,"Libyan missile misses Italian warship By the CNN Wire Staff French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle sails on June 13 , 2011 off the Libyan coast . 
The missile fell into the sea about 2 kilometers from the frigate Bersagliere `` We have n't used our real military power , '' a Gadhafi spokesman says He discounts claims that pro-Gadhafi forces are down to 20 % of their capabilities Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan government forces fired a missile at an Italian warship in the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday in a rare attack on the NATO fleet offshore , a government spokesman said . 
The frigate Bersagliere was about 19 kilometers -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- off the Libyan city of Zlitan when the missile fell harmlessly into the sea about 2 km away , the Italian defense ministry and NATO reported . 
`` The ship was not harmed and continued on its mission , '' NATO said in a statement . 
`` NATO ships go in harm 's way to seek those military targets which continue to threaten the people of Libya . '' 
In Tripoli , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters that the missile had been launched by troops that remain loyal to longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
`` We have amazing capabilities that we have not felt that we need to use , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` Our army is still very strong . 
We have n't used our real military power . '' 
He discounted allied claims that pro-Gadhafi forces had been reduced to 20 % of their capabilities , adding , `` For God 's sake , if we are down here to 20 % , what am I doing here ? '' 
Gadhafi 's forces have been battling a nearly six-month-long revolt that has split Libya roughly in half . 
NATO planes and warships joined the fight in March , pounding government troops under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from reprisals by Gadhafi loyalists . 
Though most of the allied campaign has been conducted from the air , NATO warships reported fighting at least two brief sea engagements with pro-Gadhafi forces off the port city of Misrata in May .

The State Department official said that Aujali can become the official head of mission after he works out his official diplomatic status , which was technically interrupted when he broke with the regime . 
Rebels find mines left by Libyan troops Ramadan does n't slow civil war in Libya The move comes amid internal strife in the rebel movement , and the State Department is warning the Transitional National Council to get its act together . 
An administration official told CNN the United States has warned the TNC that this is a `` do-or-die moment '' for the organization to carry out a credible and thorough investigation of the killing of its military commander , Abdel Fatah Younis . 
Concerns have been raised that last week 's mysterious assassination might have been carried out by feuding rebel groups . 
NATO has been bombing Libya for more than four months under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from troops loyal to Gadhafi . 
The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was shuttered and American personnel evacuated by sea and air in late February after the revolt erupted . 
Libyan and U.S. officials held face-to-face talks in Tunisia last month , but Washington says the sole point of the meeting was to repeat its demand that Gadhafi `` must go . ''

2011-08-04,"They slow the advance of rebel fighters In Tiji , civilians used as shields are keeping rebels from attacking , they say In Zlitan , reporters are taken to a funeral after a NATO strike Qawalish , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The front lines of Libya 's grinding war weave through the western mountains and around Zlitan , the last city east of Tripoli still under the grip of strongman Moammar Gadhafi . 
In many places that Gadhafi 's forces have fled , they 've left behind deadly fields of mines -- tens , perhaps hundreds of thousands of them , say the rebels . 
Not only do they pose a danger for civilians but they also have slowed the advance of the rebels in their march toward Tripoli . 
Here in Qawalish , a town 60 miles southwest of Tripoli where fierce fighting has taken place in recent weeks , the war looks like this : Men in no protective gear sift through a public park to fight an enemy that can kill instantly and indiscriminately . 
Here , the enemy is Gadhafi 's landmines . 
Milad al Saidy and his fellow `` sappers , '' as those who work with mines are known , are armed only with simple metal probes and a couple of metal detectors . 
A burned-out shell of a car sits as evidence of what the mines can do . 
Libya 's frontline on an ancient fort Ramadan does n't slow civil war in Libya Reporter 's journey into Western Libya So far , they say , about 2,500 mines have been discovered , all left by fleeing pro-Gadhafi forces . 
Al Saidy has been doing this work for 16 years but many others are green -- fresh recruits who volunteered for a potentially deadly job . 
Some learn on the job . 
Amazingly , al Saidy said , no one has been killed or hurt . 
`` It 's very , very dangerous but people are insisting they want to work with us to secure the lives of the innocent , the children , so families can come without the fear of landmines , '' he said . 
The sapper teams find a Chinese-made anti-tank mine , designed to blow up armored vehicles . 
The rebels explain that the anti-tank mines require a lot of pressure to detonate . 
So , Gadhafi 's men place Brazilian-made anti-personnel mines , which blow when a person steps on them , atop the bigger mines . 
The result is an easier but potentially far more deadly blast . 
The work , al Saidy said , is crucial . 
He and his men toil under the sun , even though it is Ramadan . 
They observe the rules of the holy month , neither eating nor drinking and pausing only to pray . 
`` The circumstances command us to work , '' he said . 
Farther west , rebel fighters loom over the town of Tiji from an observation post . 
This place , the locals say , was used by the Berbers 2,000 years ago to look out for invading Roman armies . 
Now it 's a lookout for a whole new war . 
The rebels call Tiji a gateway city . 
If they are able to wrest control from Gadhafi 's men , there would be little between them and Tripoli . 
But talk of victory and actually achieving it are two different things . 
The rebels said they engaged Gadhafi 's troops this week but then saw women and children running into houses . 
`` In this situation we 're facing a big problem because Gadhafi is using people as a human shield , '' said Tarek Zambou , head of the local military council . 
CNN could not independently verify that claim , but it 's clear that after making significant gains last week in half a dozen towns beneath the Nafusa Mountains , rebel advances have stalled in this key town . 
The rebels said they have sent word to residents : Leave now . 
It wo n't be long before they are firing again . 
Five months into the Libyan war , the rebels have won international support and NATO jets have continuously bombed Gadhafi 's forces . 
But so far , they have not been able to break the dictator 's hold . 
On the eastern front , they have been pushing in Zlitan . 
Thursday , however , it appeared that Gadhafi 's forces were still in control of the central city . 
In recent weeks , NATO has intensified its bombing of Zlitan , which is less than 50 miles west of rebel-held Misrata . 
Tuesday , jets struck two buildings in Zlitan , the alliance said . 
One of Gadhafi 's main battle tanks was destroyed in that attack . 
A follow-up run Thursday morning attacked another command-and-control center , used to support multiple rocket launchers , NATO said . 
A mother and her two boys were buried Thursday . 
The Libyan government , which took reporters on a tour of the city , said they were killed in the airstrikes that hit a two-story villa in a residential neighborhood . 
A NATO spokesman acknowledged the airstrike but said : `` We do not know of any casualties , we have only heard the government allegations of casualties visa the media . '' 
Abu Bakr , the brother of the slain woman , wept through the funeral . 
He pulled back the blankets covering the two small coffins bearing the bloody bodies of his nephews , Mohamed , 5 , and Motez , 3 . 
`` Whether you like it or not , we 're staying here , '' he yelled . 
`` This is our country . '' 
He damned NATO and `` the rats , '' the Libyan regime 's word for the rebels . 
Back in Qawalish , al Saidy , the sapper , leaves the minefields to return to his vehicle . 
He knows there is no end date yet for his risky work . 
`` The more we advance , the more landmines we are facing , '' he said . 
But at least on this day , there 's good news . 
CNN 's Michael Holmes reported from Qawalish and Tiji and Ivan Watson reported from Zlitan .

2011-08-04,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Thu Aug 4 , 2011 3:51 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - `` The rebels '' is a handy phrase -- but in reality there are about 40 different rebel groups and freelance militias fighting to end the long reign of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi , and it shows . 
Some fight Gaddafi 's troops on the front line while others handle security in rebel-held cities . 
And , in a country flooded with weapons , some gunmen are simply helping themselves to whatever they want , members of the armed opposition say . 
The still unexplained killing of top rebel commander General Abdul Fattah Younes last week raised doubts about the loyalty to the rebel cause of some fighters . 
Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam has done his best to exploit differences within the opposition , telling the New York Times he had made contact with Islamists among the rebels , and that a government-Islamist alliance would be announced within days . 
He said he had been in contact with an Islamist rebel leader , Ali Sallabi -- who was quoted by the New York Times as acknowledging the contacts but as saying he remained allied with the liberal rebels trying to oust Gaddafi . 
`` Now the brigades and armed groups are too many . 
Every neighborhood has one , '' said rebel fighter Yasser . 
`` Some people use the weapons for crime and theft . '' 
`` Everyone knows how to use a gun , '' he said . 
`` The Libyans are an armed people . 
Even my mother knows guns . '' 
Yasser 's brigade is officially recognized by the higher rebel authorities . 
It was raised in Benghazi by a handful of young men who took up guns to protect the neighborhood against Gaddafi forces and criminals , and now numbers over 100 fighters . 
As the civil war enters its sixth month , armed groups roam the streets in the rebel stronghold , raising fears of creeping lawlessness . 
They drive around in pickups , firing their assault rifles into the air . 
It is not always clear to which group they belong or whether it is approved by the National Transitional Council , recognized by some Western powers as Libya 's legitimate government . 
`` In my neighborhood there are groups who guard the area , they are not officially organised , but they have guns , '' said a rebel official . 
`` Anybody can go to the front and fight . 
It is easy to get a gun . 
If I take my AK-47 and want to fight on the front line , no one can stop me . '' 
Benghazi resident Essa , a steel worker before the war , proudly shows a video of 7 rocket-propelled grenade launchers made in his workshop from army weapons parts . 
The RPGs were used against Gaddafi 's troops on the western front in Misrata . 
Others put their military loot to questionable use . 
Dull explosions echo round Benghazi harbor as fishermen detonate explosives in the sea for a quick catch . 
U.S. officials say they are worried about reports that al Qaeda may already be smuggling arms and explosives out of Libya . 
A United Nations official draws a parallel with the mayhem in Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion and the fall of Saddam . 
`` We kept telling them in Iraq that they have to secure the -LRB- weapons -RRB- stores , but no one listened , '' he said . 
`` Next we would see these weapons being smuggled across the border to Iran . '' 
The Mahdi Army of anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr started as a neighborhood protection force , but grew quickly in strength and was later blamed for much of the 2006-07 sectarian slaughter that drove Iraq to the brink of civil war . 
The killing of Younes has raised similar concerns here . 
Some rebel sources say it was the work of Islamist militiamen in the rebel ranks , and exposed the opposition to the risk of a split that could spark a tribal feud . 
Armed groups such as Obaida Ibn Jarrah and Okbah Ibn Nafih brigades have been named as possible perpetrators . 
Both are named after companions of the Prophet Mohammad . 
Some say Gaddafi loyalists were obviously behind the killing of Younes , who defected after holding top government posts for 40 years -- including that of interior minister , which would have put him at odds with Islamist opponents of Gaddafi . 
Younes 's tribe has sworn to get justice itself if the rebel leaders fail to investigate his death and catch his killers . 
His death was followed by a prison break by some 300 Gaddafi loyalists and a battle between rebels and the militia who helped the prisoners to escape in the center of Benghazi . 
The militiamen belong to a group called Nedaa Libya , or Libya 's Call , which is not an official force under rebel authority . 
Fighters in Benghazi who know them never thought they might be Gaddafi loyalists until the prison break . 
`` We heard about them before but did n't know they were fifth columnists , '' said Faraj al-Sharif , a rebel fighter from the Martyrs of February 17th brigade . 
He estimates their number at 1,000 fighters , many of them still at large . 
`` Every time we ask them to surrender , they stop for a while then they start firing at us and shout Allah , Muammar , Libya and that 's all , '' he said . 
Benghazi residents now talk of Gaddafi `` sleeper cells '' in guerrilla ranks and mistrust is spreading among the locals , who treat everyone with suspicion . 
Rebel leader Mustafa Abdul-Jalil , trying to soothe public anger and avert a feud , urged militias to lay down their arms or come under the orders of the Defense or Interior ministries . 
It remains unclear how he can follow up such exhortations .

2011-08-05,"By Ivan Watson and Jomana Karadsheh , CNN NATO accused of killing family in strike An early morning NATO airstrike hits the Libyan town of Zlitan Hours later , relatives weep at the burial of a mother and her two young sons `` This is the protection of civilians , '' says a relative with disgust NATO says it has `` no reason to believe there were any civilian casualties '' from the airstrike Zlitan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A grown man sobbed as friends led him out of the mosque . 
Mustafa Naji al-Mrabet 's left hand and feet were bandaged , there were bloodstains on his robes , and the valve for an intravenous needle still stuck out of his arm . 
He was both a husband and a father , deep in mourning . 
Nearby , his brother-in-law , 26-year-old Abubakr Ali cried like a child . 
Ali pulled back the blankets covering two small coffins . 
Inside lay the bloody bodies of his nephews , Mohamed and Motez al-Mrabet , ages 5 and 3 . 
Their mother Ibtisam lay in a coffin beside them . 
All three were killed early Thursday morning as they slept , neighbors and relatives said , when their house on the outskirts of this coastal city was hit by a NATO airstrike . 
Family members said a third child , 8-year old Naji , was in intensive care after suffering serious injuries . 
Officials from Moammar Gadhafi 's embattled government brought journalists to the ruins of al-Mrabet family 's 2-story villa in a residential neighborhood on Thursday . 
`` In all my 36 years I 've never seen a day like this , '' said a neighbor named Salah Buharto . 
He said the 6:30 a.m. blast was so powerful , he initially thought his own house had been hit . 
Libya 's Zlitan in rebel , NATO sights When asked about the suspected air strike , a NATO spokesman told CNN : `` NATO made a strike in Zlitan at 6:30 a.m. -LRB- Thursday -RRB- local time . 
The target was a command and control facility held by government forces . 
`` We have had no reason to believe that there were any civilian casualties , '' said another NATO spokesman to CNN , also speaking on condition of anonymity . 
`` But we take these reports very seriously and we are looking into the matter . 
We have a process that we go through . '' 
For weeks , Zlitan has been the target of an intense NATO bombing campaign . 
The number of buildings and compounds devastated by air strikes have visibly increased since foreign journalists were taken on a government-controlled tour of the small city last month . 
The Gadhafi regime accuses NATO of hitting food warehouses , health clinics and schools . 
But a tour of one bomb site on Thursday revealed evidence suggesting the target was not entirely civilian . 
At the compound of a bombed-out law school where classroom walls were scorched and broken glass littered the floor , CNN found several military uniforms lying on the ground next to wooden ammunition crates . 
When asked about the military paraphernalia , a government escort said the ammo boxes and uniforms `` belonged to school security guards . '' 
Meanwhile , every few seconds , rocket and cannon fire rumbled in the distance , as rebels and regime loyalists fought a deadly artillery duel across the front lines a few miles to the east of the city . 
Zlitan is located less than 50 miles west of the rebel-held port city of Misrata , which survived a long , bloody siege by Gadhafi forces . 
Over the last week , rebel commanders claimed to have captured parts of Zlitan after advancing west from Misrata . 
But on Thursday , the city center appeared to remain firmly in loyalist hands . 
The combined NATO and rebel offensive have clearly taken their toll on Zlitan . 
On Thursday , the city 's streets were mostly deserted and most of the shops were closed . 
Residents said they suffered from long power outages lasting 10 hours or longer . 
Civilian cars and an ambulance smeared with dirt -- a tactic used by both rebels and regime fighters to camouflage vehicles -- raced through the town center . 
The rebel Transitional National Council and its allies in Washington , London , and Paris have long demanded that Gadhafi step down . 
But more than five months after anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted across Libya , the flamboyant colonel is still clinging to power . 
His government is threatening a war of attrition against his enemies . 
`` This war , this honorable confrontation , could go on for years , '' warned Gadhafi 's main spokesman , Musa Ibrahim , in a press conference on Wednesday . 
`` We do not want it to ... but from the beginning we were preparing ourselves to fight on the diplomatic front for years , on the military front for years , on the economic front for years . '' 
As always in conflict , civilians pay the highest price . 
At Thursday 's funeral , Abubakr Ali watched volunteers carefully bury the bodies of his sister and two nephews next to the neighborhood mosque . 
`` This was a civilian home . 
No army , no military , no Gadhafi forces . 
It 's a family sleeping safely in their place , '' he said . 
`` This is the protection of civilians , '' Ali added with disgust . 
He was referring to the United Nations Security Council resolution which authorizes the use of force in Libya in order to protect civilian lives . 
As tears streamed down his face , Ali took a Kalashnikov rifle and fired a round of bullets into the air . 
`` Screw NATO and the -LRB- rebel -RRB- rats and screw those who gave the coordinates for the attack , '' he yelled . 
`` God damn you now and in the afterlife . 
Moammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , I 'm with you until the last drop of blood . ''

2011-08-05,"From an ancient fort Libyan rebels watch over the front line town of Taji Rebel commander says if Taji and one other town falls , there is little between them and Tripoli The ridge has been used for centuries to watch enemies for on the Libyan plains Today the rebels ' flag flutters from the fort built on the ridgeline Nafusa Mountains , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The lonely ridge that tops the Nafusa Mountains has been used for centuries as a lookout point , a place where enemies are watched . 
Two thousand years ago , Berber men would sit in a stone lookout over the majestic brown plains , watching for strangers or enemies approaching their villages . 
Today , their descendants use the same ridgeline to watch over their own enemies -- the forces of Moammar Gadhafi entrenched in the dusty city of Tiji below . 
Tarek Zambou was an intelligence officer in those forces , until the revolt began and he defected , returning home to the town of Kabaw , a few kilometers from where he now stands . 
He commands the area 's Military Council . 
Today he stands on the windswept point next to a solitary tank standing sentry and points to Taji , nine kilometers away but clearly visible across the flat desert plain . 
`` It is a very important place for us to take , '' he said . 
`` And we will take it , no problem . '' 
Rebels find mines left by Libyan troops Ramadan does n't slow civil war in Libya He says if Taji and then the smaller town of Bader a few kilometers to the east are taken there will be little between his men and the doorstep of Tripoli . 
The rebels made significant advances last week , sweeping off the mountain high ground to the plains , and capturing half a dozen towns and cities . 
That advance stopped at Tiji , the city now sealed off by rebels on three sides . 
The fourth , to the northeast , is the way to Tripoli . 
Zambou says his men prodded forward and engaged Gadhafi forces on the city 's outskirts earlier this week , withdrawing when they saw civilians inside . 
They had believed most , if not all , had fled . 
`` In this situation we 're facing a big problem , '' he said . 
`` Gadhafi is using people as a human shield , and we do n't want to hurt civilians . '' 
But he says patience is wearing thin . 
Multiple warnings have been sent to civilians inside Tiji , telling them to leave , and leave soon . 
`` We -LRB- will -RRB- go in . 
We -LRB- will -RRB- try as we can to avoid the civilian people but we should go -LRB- in -RRB- . 
Because we give them the chance , '' he said . 
During our visit to this historic observation post , we heard anti-aircraft fire coming from the city . 
`` No problem , '' Zambou calls out to our crew , trying to be reassuring . 
`` They see us and they shoot , but the ammunition they shoot wo n't reach here . 
I like to hear it -- it means they 're wasting bullets . '' 
We follow Zambou 's car down the winding mountain road , closer to Tiji , our crew still marveling at the brutal yet spectacular terrain . 
Three rebel fighters sit beneath a flapping tarpaulin , peering down the deserted road to the besieged city . 
There 's another rebel position two more kilometers down the road , Zambou tells us . 
A Grad rocket killed three of his fighters there recently . 
We tell him we want to go to that final post , to interview the men there , but Zambou refuses . 
`` No , too dangerous - the road is very exposed on the way there , '' he said . 
`` Gadhafi troops will see you and probably fire with anti-aircraft guns , maybe rockets . 
`` I 'm not worried about you , '' he added . 
`` But the rockets could hit my men . 
Do n't go . '' 
We do n't , and so we return to Kabaw .

2011-08-05,"LONDON | Fri Aug 5 , 2011 12:48 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mired in a slow-moving ground war , Libya 's warring parties are turning to propaganda to try to splinter each other 's support base and gain leverage in talks on a political settlement . 
Muammar Gaddafi is playing on fears among Libyans that Western-backed rebels will tip the country deeper into chaos . 
The opposition 's message is that only an end to Gaddafi 's 41-year-old rule can bring peace , stability and justice . 
The war of words is not new : Both sides took to the airwaves and the Internet within hours of the February start of a revolt against Gaddafi 's government . 
But now international contacts are under way on a political solution , both sides are looking more urgently at psychological warfare to boost negotiating clout in the absence of a decisive military move in Libya 's deserts , mountains and towns . 
An eye-catching example of the information struggle emerged on Wednesday when one of Gaddafi 's sons aired the possibility of an alliance with Islamist `` terrorists , '' a startling U-turn after the government 's previous insistence that its main enemy in the conflict was al Qaeda . 
`` Libya will look like Saudi Arabia , like Iran . 
Saif al-Islam told the New York Times , adding he would now form an alliance with Islamists among the rebels . 
Saif al-Islam has campaigned prominently for reconciliation with Islamist militants over the past five years , and helped arrange the release of hundreds of them from prison . 
But the killing by Gaddafi loyalists of civilians in the 2011 uprising destroyed Saif al-Islam 's credibility with Islamists , analysts say . 
His latest remarks were greeted with derision by a wide range of Libyan opposition commentators . 
`` It 's childish scare tactics , '' U.S.-based Libyan activist Hafed al-Ghwell told Reuters . 
`` The logic is , ` Let 's frighten the hell out of the West by suggesting we 'll ally with Islamists . ' '' 
`` He knows very well that if Islamists ever move on Tripoli , their first target will be Gaddafi and his family . '' 
Ashour Shamis , a UK-based opposition activist and editor , said Islam 's remarks showed the Gaddafi camp was `` absolutely desperate . 
It 's pathetic . '' 
`` They are clutching at straws , '' he said . 
Noman Benotman , a former opposition guerrilla commander who once worked closely with Saif al-Islam on his reconciliation program , said the government had started to work with some members of a highly conservative , apolitical group of Salafi Islamists in Tripoli to try to counter rebel influence . 
State television has also spoken vaguely of a possible Islamist tie-up . 
Benotman said , however , that Saif al-Islam 's claim of a link to Islamists working within the rebel camp were false and `` psychological warfare . '' 
But if the purported Gaddafi-Islamist tie-up sounds outlandish , the rebels ' credibility is if anything more compromised . 
Despite weeks of sporadic gains on the ground and advances on the diplomatic arena , the rebels are on the defensive in the battle for Libyan hearts and minds as never before following the unexplained death on July 28 of their military leader Abdel Fattah Younes . 
His killing has drawn attention to rifts in the rebel camp , an assortment of armed groups that , especially in the east , has struggled to project an image of unity -LRB- ID : nLDE7731AF -RRB- Younes 's family has criticised the handling of the murky case by the rebel National Transitional Council and said it might take justice into its own hands unless rebel leaders come clean over exactly who killed him . 
A propaganda gift to Gaddafi , the killing has raised concerns over instability and sustained trouble even if the opposition ousts the veteran leader . 
GADDAFI POINTS TO EGYPT , TUNISIA UNREST Worries are running so deep that when a rebel spokesman on Friday reported the death of another of Gaddafi 's sons , Khamis , Libya-watchers immediately suspected it was a propaganda ploy to distract attention from Saif al-Islam 's New York Times interview , which received wide attention in the Arab world . 
`` It 's probably just propaganda , '' one Libya analyst said . 
`` It looks a bit desperate . '' 
The report was denied with hours by a Gaddafi spokesman . 
Apparently buoyed by Younes 's death , Saif al-Islam on Aug 2 seemed to remove a government offer of ceasefire talks if NATO stopped bombing , saying regardless of whether NATO disengaged from Libya , the war would continue until all Libya was freed . 
Pointing to post-revolution unrest in Egypt and Tunisia , Gaddafi said in a July 23 audio address that the uprisings there had resulted in looting and destruction . 
The message may well have been intended for a local audience , analysts say . 
Gaddafi in June posed playing chess with a senior Russian chess player , looking relaxed and focus . 
Al-Ghwell , the U.S.-based Libya activist , said he worried that the ousting of Gaddafi was taking such a long time , although he was confident the rebels would eventually win . 
`` The fact is that the longer this lasts the more likely we 'll have more incidents like the killing of Younes and the more likely we 'll have a messy situation in general . ''

2011-08-05,"U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South . 
Full Article Family 's death illustrates divided Libya SOUQ AL-JUMAA , Libya | Fri Aug 5 , 2011 8:12 am IST SOUQ AL-JUMAA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A few kilometers from the front-lines , some of the youngest victims of Libya 's civil war lay on Thursday in simple coffins , testimony to the toll of the conflict in which neither side boasts a clear advantage . 
Musatafa al-Marabit , his feet bandaged and his clothes spotted with blood , was led sobbing from the three coffins containing the bodies of his wife and two young sons . 
They were reportedly killed by an airstrike early on Thursday in their home west of Zlitan , the strategically located city some 160 kilometres -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli that has become Libya 's third front . 
In a conflict in which murkiness and mutual suspicions abound , foreign journalists were bussed to Zlitan , where nearby rebels are battling Gaddafi 's forces on a fluctuating front - line , to film the remains of Marabit 's house and to a nearby burial site to examine the blood-stained bodies of his boys . 
Marabit 's wife Ibtisam , who officials said was killed alongside her children while her husband attended morning prayers , lay in another coffin which was unopened in keeping with Islamic tradition . 
For supporters of Gaddafi , who has defied expectations since Western powers began their air campaign in March by clinging defiantly to power , the incident was proof of the brutality of foreign aggressors who dared to strike civilians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . 
`` They are attacking Islam ; there is no other explanation , '' neighbor Atiya Mohamed shouted as he stood among the rubble that was Marabit 's home . 
Yet NATO and the rebels hoping to seize Zlitan and eventually capture the fortified capital will likely portray it as more evidence of Gaddafi stationing civilians at military sites as he seeks to avoid further damage to his fighting prowess . 
The Gaddafi government routinely reports deaths inflicted by NATO airstrikes , whose victims it calls ` martyrs , ' but Thursday 's events marked the first time in weeks officials had offered details of the identities of those it said were killed by NATO bombs . 
It was also the first time in weeks it had offered journalists an opportunity to report on human victims of airstrikes at close range . 
After the attack , NATO acknowledged it had hit a military command site in the area around 6:30 a.m. , approximately the time officials and neighbors said Marabit 's house was struck . 
`` We always take seriously allegations of civilian casualties and are looking into it , but we have no evidence at this stage that this was caused by an air strike , '' a NATO official in Naples said . 
While there was no evidence of any military activity among the shattered cinderblock and cushions strewn around Marabit 's destroyed home , rebels fighting for control of Zlitan raised questions about the building 's true use . 
If confirmed , the attack near Zlitan would not be the first time since Western-led airstrikes began in Libya in late March that NATO activity has resulted in civilian deaths . 
In June , NATO admitted it destroyed a house in Tripoli in which Libyan officials said nine civilians were killed . 
Shortly afterwards , the Libyan government reported almost 20 people were killed in a strike on the home of a member of Libya 's 12-strong Revolutionary Command Council , led by Gaddafi . 
More such incidents could undermine support for a campaign already on shaky ground in some NATO nations , where financial pressures have added to doubts about a campaign that has yet to bring peace in Libya . 
Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said the incident would stoke anti-Western rage . 
`` What NATO is doing is very dangerous . 
It is planting the seeds of hatred in the hearts of millions of Libyans , '' he said . 
Residents of Zlitan and Souq al-Jumaa , on the town 's western outskirts , brushed aside rebel claims this week Gaddafi 's opponents were on the cusp of capturing the town . 
Zlitan was quiet as foreign journalists toured the center of the town on Thursday afternoon , as fasting Muslims rested or stayed indoors due to the heat . 
But the silence was interrupted regularly by the thuds of shelling or rocket attacks just to the east . 
Government minders took journalists to see several other sites apparently hit by NATO strikes , including a large school and the local law college , where among rubble and law books lay empty ammunition boxes and green military clothing in the dirt . 
Mohamed Salim , minding a deserted toy store , said some Zlitan residents had fled and power cuts had become more frequent as fighting had increased in the past few weeks . 
But he said he was n't afraid of the advance of rebels . 
`` I only fear god , '' he said .

BENGHAZI , Libya | Sat Aug 6 , 2011 2:44 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels Saturday said they had launched a push to capture the coastal oil town of Brega , but were advancing slowly because Muammar Gaddafi 's forces had sown minefields across its approaches . 
`` There 's a big movement on all fronts around Brega . 
We are attacking from three sides , '' said spokesman Mohammad Zawawi . 
Fighting on the eastern front of the civil war , which has moved backwards and forwards for the past months , has been bogged down for weeks on the fringes of Brega , about 750 kilometers -LRB- 465 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . 
Zawawi said rebel forces were in sight of a residential area of Brega and believed they could take the town , which is south of the rebel capital Benghazi on the eastern side of the Gulf of Sirte . 
`` It could be very soon , but we do n't want to lose anybody so we 're moving slowly but surely , '' he said . 
In Misrata , a Qatari plane made a quick stop to offload ammunition destined for rebel fighters , sources with knowledge of the flight said . 
Airport officials acknowledged a Qatari plane had landed but declined to reveal details of its contents . 
`` The plane offloaded six pickup trucks which were packed with ammunition , and minutes later it flew off again , '' said one source , speaking on condition of anonymity . 
Rebels have complained about a lack of weapons and ammunition to effectively push forward to the capital . 
France has also supplied ammunition and weapons in air-drops . 
Qatar has been one of staunchest supporters of Libyans seeking to topple Muammar Gaddafi from power . 
Friday was another day of claim and counter-claim in the six-month-old war now being waged on three fronts -- in the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli , near Misrata to the east of the capital , and around Brega between Misrata and Benghazi . 
Gaddafi 's government Friday denied a rebel report a NATO air strike on Zlitan , a town west of Misrata , had killed the Libyan leader 's son Khamis who commands of one of the government 's most loyal and best-equipped units . 
Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said word of Khamis Gaddafi 's death was a ploy to cover up the killing of three civilians in Zlitan , a battlefront city where Gaddafi forces are trying to halt the rebel advance on Tripoli . 
`` It 's false news . 
This is a dirty trick to cover up their crime in Zlitan , '' he told Reuters . 
A rebel spokesman said the NATO air strike had killed 32 Gaddafi loyalists in Zlitan , where Khamis Gaddafi 's elite 32nd Brigade is believed to have been leading the defense of the approaches to Tripoli , 160 kilometers away . 
NATO said it had targeted a command-and-control target in the Zlitan area but `` can not confirm anything right now because we do n't have people on the ground . '' 
Rebels who cleared Gaddafi 's forces from Libya 's third-largest city Misrata after weeks of intense fighting have been trying to push westwards and take Zlitan , which would open the coastal road toward his Tripoli stronghold . 
There have been two reports of Khamis 's death in the past six months : Arab media reported in March he had died in a kamikaze crash by a disaffected Libyan air force pilot . 
Libyan state television countered with pictures of a man resembling Khamis , which it said disproved the report of his death . 
The government said earlier this year a NATO strike in Tripoli had killed Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Arab , who unlike Khamis did not have a high public profile or a major leadership role . 
Gaddafi has kept control of the capital despite severe fuel shortages and rebel advances backed since March by Western air strikes , assault helicopter attacks and naval bombardments . 
The rebels face numerous problems , from stalling battlefield momentum to internal splits , exposed starkly last week when military chief Abdel Fattah Younes was assassinated behind his own lines in circumstances yet to be explained . 
Near the capital , rebels also control the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli . 
A rebel official there , Colonel Juma Ibrahim , told Reuters his forces had set an ultimatum to the surrounded town of Tiji to surrender or face attack Saturday . 
Rebels were using loud-hailers to appeal to a tribal chief close to Gaddafi to evacuate civilians from Tiji and broker the withdrawal of pro-Gaddafi forces . 
`` If he does not comply , we will attack , '' said Ibrahim .

NEW : At least eight rebels are killed in the fighting , medical sources say An hourslong battle breaks out in the western Libyan town of Bir Al-Ghanam Rebels are moving toward the capital , Tripoli Opposition members have been seeking the ouster of Moammar Gadhafi for months Near Bir Al-Ghanam , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan rebel forces gained ground against ruler Moammar Gadhafi 's forces Saturday after a massive offensive in the western town of Bir Al-Ghanam . 
Rebel commanders said 1,500 opposition members joined in the battle , which lasted five hours . 
Rockets and gunfire were exchanged from both sides , and rebels took on Gadhafi fighters from three fronts . 
At least eight rebels were killed and dozens more wounded , according to medical sources . 
Casualties inflicted on Gadhafi forces were not immediately known . 
Rebel fighters said Gadhafi 's forces had retreated from Bir Al-Ghanam and claimed victory over the town . 
The offensive began at dawn as hundreds of rebels swept in from the west off the Nafusa mountains and into the plains below . 
The fighters in Saturday 's attack are part of what some have dubbed a Mad Max army -- a fleet of pickup trucks modified to take heavy weapons speeding across the desert . 
Most of the men were civilians before the fighting broke out . 
Bir Al-Ghanam is about 85 kilometers -LRB- 53 miles -RRB- from the capital city of Tripoli . 
Capturing the town is significant because not much else stands in the way between Bir Al-Ghanam and the Libyan coastline -- where Tripoli is situated . 
`` It was very , very fierce , '' one rebel fighter told CNN after the offensive was over . 
`` But there is no time to rest . 
The next step , Tripoli . '' 
For months , rebel fighters -- who have controlled the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer toward Tripoli , in the west . 
They are seeking the ouster of Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for 42 years .

Bir al-Ghanam is about 85 kilometers -LRB- 53 miles -RRB- southwest of the Libyan capital Tripoli . 
Its capture is significant because little else stands between Bir Al-Ghanam and the Libyan coastline where Tripoli is situated . 
After rebels gained control of the town Saturday , one rebel fighter told CNN the `` next step '' was Tripoli . 
Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi Al-Mahmoudi told reporters in Tripoli on Sunday that rebel forces had the town for only a few hours . 
Bir al-Ghanam `` is now back in the hands of the honorable brave tribes , with its surface back in normal life and under the control of the legitimate government of Libya , '' Al-Mahmoudi said . 
But Nasr Abu al Qassem , who was in Zintan , about 70 km -LRB- 43 miles -RRB- southwest of Bir al-Ghanam , said rebels remained at the front line in Bir Al-Ghanam and were being reinforced . 
The situation in the town was stable , he said .

Rebels say they have maintained control of the city . 
NEW : NATO jets strike Tripoli hard NEW : A rebel spokesman says government claims regarding a key town are false The government had said Gadhafi 's forces had retaken the town Rebels said they are holding firm Zintan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan rebels said Monday they remain in control of a key western town they seized from Moammar Gadhafi forces Saturday , although clashes continued just east of it . 
The Libyan government said earlier its forces had retaken Bir al-Ghanam but Jumma Ibrahim , a rebel spokesman in the western mountain region , said the claims were false . 
Rebel commander Nasser abu al Qassem told CNN Monday that the rebels are holding firm on the town 's eastern outskirts , squaring off against loyalists just a few miles away at a key road junction the rebels hope to take in the days ahead . 
He reported regular exchanges of fire between the two sides . 
The rebels entered Bir al-Ghanam in June but only held it for a matter of hours . 
Capturing the town puts the rebels closer to Tripoli than they 've been before . 
The town is about 85 kilometers -LRB- 53 miles -RRB- southwest of the Libyan capital . 
Meanwhile , bombs rained down on Tripoli overnight , the sky lit up by explosives . 
Multiple airstrikes and secondary explosions could be heard continuously for the better part of an hour . 
Entire neighborhoods of the city were already without electricity -- due to shortages of fuel -- prior to the pre-dawn strikes . 
Parts of Tripoli have been suffering for days from such blackouts . 
Gadhafi 's forces fired several rockets Sunday in Bir al-Ghanam , causing minor damage inside the town but no rebel injuries , al Qassem said . 
He reported no further rocket attacks so far Monday . 
Al Qassem said NATO forces had informed the rebels that the Gadhafi forces included up to 40 trucks outfitted with heavy weapons , and rebel forces had reinforced their positions Sunday and overnight into Monday . 
He was confident the rebel lines would hold and said there had been no concerted effort so far by the government troops to try to re-take Bir al-Ghanam . 
The battle to take Bir al-Ghanam lasted for nearly five hours Saturday and was fought on three fronts . 
CNN witnessed heavy rocket , mortar and anti aircraft gun fire from the rebel side at one front near a Gadhafi military encampment three kilometres west of the town . 
Gadhafi forces returned fire with rockets and mortars . 
Commanders said taking the junction where Gadhafi forces remain east of the town would provide a direct route to the coastal city of Azzawayia . 
They told CNN they would n't reveal a timetable to move further forward , but said there would be `` surprises from the fighters of Zintan very soon . 
For months , rebel fighters -- who control the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer to the capital .

Rebels say they have maintained control of the city . 
NEW : Council reopens London Embassy ; rebels report advances near B'ir al Ghanam 14 members of the Transitional National Council 's executive board are dismissed A TNC spokesman says the death of the rebels ' military commander plays a role He says some who served on the board could be included in a new Cabinet -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan Transitional National Council Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil has dismissed the rebels ' 14-member executive board , a spokesman for the council said Tuesday . 
The death of the rebel government 's military commander , Gen. Abdel Fattah Younis , on July 28 played a role in board members ' ouster Monday , said Shamsiddin Abdulmolah , the council 's media director . 
`` They were dismissed because of some are directly responsible for how Gen. Younis was arrested , '' Abdulmolah said . 
`` There were shortcomings and mishandling of the events that led to his assassination . '' 
Younis and two other rebels were killed after the TNC sought to question him about allegations that he or those close to him had ongoing ties to Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi , Younis ' supporters have said . 
At least four people are directly responsible administratively for the events leading to the Younis assassination , Abdulmolah said . 
But the criminal investigation is still ongoing , and no arrests have been officially been made . 
Despite their dismissal , Abdulmolah said `` some of the people who served on the board can definitely be included in the new Cabinet . '' 
The rebel government 's chairman commissioned Mahmoud Jibril , the former head of the executive board , to submit new names to be considered for a new board soon , Abdulmolah said , but no exact deadline was mentioned . 
NATO has used air power to enforce a U.N. resolution protecting civilians from the Gadhafi regime , and world powers have announced their support for Libya 's rebel umbrella group . 
But concerns have been raised that the mysterious assassination might have been carried out by feuding rebel groups . 
According to Gadhafi spokesman Musa Ibrahim , Younis ' killing represented `` more proof that the transitional council of the traitors is not able to lead any sort of government or have any control of eastern cities of Libya . '' 
In July , rebel military council member Mohammad Ethish released a statement that seemed to imply that Gadhafi loyalists had something to do with the death . 
`` This incident will increase the will and courage of the rebels , and it will even get us close together to reach the home of the tyrant , '' Ethish said . 
`` We promise our brothers in the East that we will do the impossible to avenge the death of Abdul Fattah Younis , and we promise that we will increase our blows and empower our will . 
Until we capture the tyrant Moammar Gadhafi . '' 
A one-time general in Gadhafi 's army , Younis told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to bomb Benghazi -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands . 
Meanwhile , the Libyan Embassy in London re-opened Tuesday under National Transitional Council management , a shift that `` marks very clearly the fundamental change that is taking place in Libya , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said . 
Rebel forces also reported Tuesday that they had advanced more than 9 miles -LRB- 15 kilometers -RRB- north from B'ir al Ghanam toward the key coastal city of Az Zawiyah , which is about 27 miles -LRB- 43 kilometers -RRB- west of Tripoli . 
Rebels took B'ir al Ghanam in fierce fighting Saturday .

2011-08-09,"\* Follows Britain 's recognition of rebels \* Gaddafi planning legal challenge-The Times \* Opposition flag to be hoisted on Tuesday -LRB- Adds quote , report of Gaddafi legal challenge -RRB- LONDON , Aug 9 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Diplomats named by Libya 's rebel administration , the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , took over the London embassy previously staffed by appointees of Muammar Gaddafi 's government on Tuesday , the British Foreign office said . 
Britain recognized the NTC as Libya 's sole legitimate government in late July and said it would invite a new Libyan diplomatic mission made up of opponents of Gaddafi . 
`` The National Transitional Council is the sole legitimate governmental authority in Libya . 
It is therefore right that their representatives are now staffing the Libyan Embassy , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement . 
The Times newspaper reported that Gaddafi 's government was planning to use anti-squatter laws to try to evict the embassy 's new occupants . 
It said Gaddafi 's lawyers were also seeking to challenge Britain 's recognition of the opposition and to prevent Britain from using frozen Libyan state assets . 
A Foreign Office spokesman said he was not aware of any such legal proceedings against the British government . 
The NTC had said families of rebel civil war victims would hoist the red , black and green flag representing the Libyan rebel movement over the embassy in the Belgravia district . 
The green Libyan flag of the Gaddafi government flew above the building until this weekend . 
It has since been removed . 
`` The reopening of the Embassy symbolises how far we have come . 
The Embassy represents the legitimate government of Libya and in line with this , will serve all the Libyan community irrespective of their political allegiances , '' the new charge d'affaires , Mahmud Nacua , said in a statement .

2011-08-10,"GENEVA | Wed Aug 10 , 2011 3:43 am EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Hospitals , health care workers and ambulances are increasingly targeted in conflicts from Libya to Somalia , depriving millions of sick and wounded of treatment , the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Wednesday . 
The independent aid agency , which delivers vital supplies and collects the wounded and dead from battlefields , called for a halt to deadly assaults on medical facilities and personnel . 
`` Hospitals in Sri Lanka and Somalia have been shelled , ambulances in Libya shot at , paramedics in Colombia killed and wounded people in Afghanistan forced to languish for hours in vehicles held up at checkpoints , '' Yves Daccord , ICRC director-general , said in a statement . 
The ICRC has documented security incidents in 16 countries that disrupted delivery of health care , many of them deliberate attacks violating international humanitarian law , according to its report `` Health Care in Danger : Making the Case . '' 
`` The most shocking finding is that people die in large numbers not because they are direct victims of a roadside bomb or a shooting , '' said Dr. Robin Coupland , who led the research . 
`` They die because the ambulance does not get there in time , because health personnel are prevented from doing their work , because hospitals are themselves targets of attacks or simply because the environment is too dangerous for effective health care to be delivered , '' said the British war surgeon . 
The violence , often accompanied by looting , means doctors and nurses leave their jobs , hospitals run out of drugs or fuel to run generators and vaccination campaigns grind to a halt . 
This leaves patients even more vulnerable to diseases which can break out in conflict areas , such as polio and cholera . 
In Libya , a healthcare system that relied on foreign workers was crippled when the civil war prompted an exodus , leaving hospitals in Misrata and Benghazi critically understaffed . 
Under the Geneva Conventions , the wounded and sick , whether civilians or combatants , must receive prompt medical treatment . 
Yet many armies and rebels flout humanitarian law , according to the ICRC , which is launching a four-year awareness campaign . 
`` In conflicts all over the world , combatants overlook their responsibility to care for civilians caught in the crossfire . 
Invariably , it is relatives and neighbors who bring civilian casualties to hospital , '' it said . 
Hospitals have been used to store weapons or launch attacks , contravening the principle that they should be neutral and provide care to all patients , the report said . 
Afghanistan , Iraq , Sri Lanka and Somalia have suffered some of the worst attacks against medical centers and staff , it said . 
Somalia , now reeling from famine in the south , lost only the second batch of medical graduates in 20 years when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a university ceremony in Mogadishu in December 2009 , killing 22 . 
In a particularly outrageous attack in Afghanistan , Taliban insurgents in the southern city of Kandahar used an ambulance packed with explosives last April to kill 12 people at a police training base , the ICRC said . 
The Arab Spring has brought fresh abuses , according to the ICRC , whose officials run mobile clinics , perform war surgery and negotiate safe passage for ambulances through checkpoints . 
`` In recent unrest in Bahrain , Syria and Yemen , protesters have been too afraid to use medical facilities for fear their wounds will identify them and provoke harsh reprisals , '' it said . 
In Bahrain , the tiny Sunni-ruled Gulf state which crushed pro-democracy protests in February , the military took over Salmaniya hospital in Manama `` after it was perceived to support the cause of anti-government protesters , '' the report said . 
Some 47 doctors and nurses who treated injured protesters mostly from the majority Shi'ite community were detained in `` sweeping arrests of health workers , '' it said . 
Some face trial in a military court . 
The ICRC said it had reports from Libya suggesting that Ajdabiyah hospital was `` used as cover for snipers , '' a violation of the hospital 's protected status . 
It gave no details . 
`` In Libya , the ICRC is also receiving allegations of the misuse of the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems to support military operations and the use of ambulances to transport arms and armed combatants , '' it added .

2011-08-10,"\* Police confiscate five trucks loaded with gasoline \* Cargo ` was to be smuggled to Gaddafi-held Libya ' \* Fuel supplies key to whether Gaddafi can hold on TUNIS , Aug 10 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Tunisia has intercepted five truckloads of fuel set to be smuggled into neighbouring Libya , an official said on Wednesday , in a move to curb an illegal trade which is helping to keep Muammar Gaddafi in power . 
International sanctions and the effects of Libya 's civil war have disrupted normal supplies of motor fuel to parts of the country under Gaddafi 's control , but huge volumes of gasoline are instead being smuggled across the Libyan-Tunisian border . 
A spokesman for Tunisia 's Interior Ministry said the trucks were seized at the weekend in the town of Msaken , in the Sousse region about 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- south of the Tunisian capital . 
`` The police seized five trucks of gasoline -LRB- destined -RRB- for the pro-Gaddafi side , '' said the spokesman . 
`` They were heading for Libya but the police stopped the trucks . '' 
Amateur footage posted on video-sharing site YouTube by Libyan opposition activists purported to show the trucks which were seized . 
In the video , the door of a shipping container on the back of one of the trucks was swung open . 
Inside , concealed behind some cardboard packaging , was a large plastic tank which one of the men present said contained fuel . 
The seizure was confirmed by a source in western Libya , near the border with Tunisia , who is working with anti-Gaddafi rebels . 
`` Container trucks with gasoline were trying to go from Tunisia to Libya and were blocked from entry . 
They were heading for the -LRB- Libyan -RRB- government , '' said the source , who did not want to be identified . 
Western governments trying to bring an end to Gaddafi 's 41-year rule believe that fuel supplies are crucial to his ability to hold onto power . 
A NATO naval blockade and sanctions that prevent fuel traders from doing business with a list of Libyan companies and individuals have made it extremely difficult for Gaddafi 's administration to bring in fuel by legal means . 
However , smuggling networks help make up the shortfall . 
Libyans buy black-market gasoline in Tunisia , much of which has been smuggled out of neighbouring energy producer Algeria , and then carry it across the border into Libya . 
Until now there has been little evidence of Tunisian authorities taking firm action against the illegal trade with Libya . 
Smugglers provide a livelihood for some communities in Tunisia and so they constitute a powerful interest group .

2011-08-10,"VIENNA\/MILAN | Wed Aug 10 , 2011 4:54 am EDT VIENNA\/MILAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Civil war in Libya shut off oil supplies to Austrian energy group OMV -LRB- OMVV . 
VI -RRB- and Italian refiner Saras -LRB- SRS . 
MI -RRB- in the second quarter , taking a toll on profit and clouding the outlook in the region . 
OMV said the unrest in Libya would continue to halt its production there for the rest of the year while Saras , which swung to a net loss , said it will reduce refining runs in the second half to help offset the shortfall . 
Saras , Italy 's No. 3 refiner , is normally a big buyer of Libyan crude , with some 35 percent to 40 percent of supplies coming from the North African country . 
`` Until the Libyan situation stabilizes I do n't see Saras doing great things , it 's a catalyzer for the stock , '' a Milan-based analyst said . 
At 4:19 a.m. EDT Saras shares were down 1.49 percent at 1.127 euros while OMV shares were up 4.95 percent at 23.83 euros . 
The STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . 
SXEP was down 0.57 percent . 
OMV 's Libyan production was normal until February 20 and then fell sharply as the revolt against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule forced it to turn to oil from other countries . 
It obtained around a tenth of its oil from Libya last year but production is now zero . 
The group has a long-term stake in the crisis-hit country with 12 exploration and production licenses and Libyan petroleum contracts running up to 2032 . 
In its half-year report , Saras said it had established ties with the new political structures being created in Libya , adding this had allowed it to close a commercial deal . 
In July sources said a tanker carrying crude oil had sailed from Benghazi to Sardinia , as Libya 's rebels sold the last of their stockpile to raise urgently needed funds . 
OMV said high exploration expenses , lower refining margins and foreign exchange rates hurt results as high oil prices failed to offset lower output . 
Net profit excluding one-offs and unrealized gains from valuing inventories fell 25 percent in the second quarter to 236 million euros -LRB- $ 332.4 million -RRB- , in line with a Reuters poll of analyst forecasts . 
Saras , which swung to a net loss of 44.3 million euros from a profit of 2.4 million euros a year ago , said its refining margin in the second quarter fell to $ 0.5 per barrel versus $ 1.2 per barrel a year earlier . 
A shortfall in Libyan production and the weak dollar also took their toll on Total -LRB- TOTF .

2011-08-11,"The United States and its NATO allies have been pushing for the ouster of Moammar Gadhafi for more than six months now . 
The Libyan strongman continues to hold on , but it may just be a matter of time before he is forced from power . 
We asked him to summarize the challenges the United States will likely face and what it should be prepared to do . 
Here is what he had to say : The first challenge will be security . 
Failure to maintain public order is what got us into big trouble in Iraq , where Saddam Hussein s stay behind operation stirred civic unrest and destroyed government buildings . 
The murder in Libya last month of the overall rebel commander is a reminder that internecine warfare among the more than forty-five rebel militias is a real possibility . 
People who lost family and tribal members to the Gadhafi regime may seek to settle scores . 
Former regime elements may seek to defend themselves and to privatize state assets . 
Criminals will see opportunities to traffic in arms , drugs and even people . 
The humanitarian challenges will be no less daunting . 
Fighting has displaced at least half a million Libyans from their homes . 
Perhaps half of those are still in Libya , and many who are not will seek to return quickly once Gadhafi falls . 
Food , water , shelter and health services need to be secured for the most vulnerable . 
In addition , keeping water and electricity flowing to the residents of Tripoli and other major urban centers will be vital to maintaining public order , especially if Qaddafi falls this summer . 
U.S. interests in Libya are limited , but a relatively successful transition from the Gadhafi regime to a united , stable , more open and democratic Libya would be seen in the region and more widely as a credit to the NATO-led intervention . 
It would also enable Libya to resume oil and gas exports , demonstrate the international community s capacity to manage such transitions and encourage positive outcomes to other Arab Spring protests , including those in Yemen and Syria . 
Failure to stabilize Libya could lead to chaos , breakup of the Libyan state that sets an unwelcome precedent elsewhere , or restoration of dictatorship . 
These outcomes would all damage American and allied credibility and likely also cause major problems for our European allies , including shortfalls in energy supplies , loss of major investments and a continuing refugee flow . 
Refugees could also cause problems in Tunisia , Egypt , and the rest of the Mediterranean . 
It is therefore the Europeans , along with the Arab League , who should take the lead in post-Gadhafi stabilization of Libya , under a clear United Nations Security Council mandate that recognizes a legitimate post-Gadhafi Libyan authority and sets out strategic goals for the transition . 
The goals should include a united and sovereign Libya within its well-established borders that can sustain , govern , and defend itself through inclusive democratic institutions , using Libya s resources transparently and accountably for the benefit of all its people . 
Quick deployment of a peacekeeping force of several thousand paramilitary police , mainly to keep order in Tripoli and other population centers , would help ensure these goals are met . 
The European Union and its member states can deploy several hundred paramilitaries . 
Turkey and Arab countries might supply the remainder . 
An international peacekeeping operation would not administer Libya but would support an inclusive interim authority in maintaining stability , providing humanitarian assistance , and beginning the reconstruction process . 
What if this does not work ? 
NATO will need to be prepared to step in . 
Only as a last resort to deal with widespread disorder , a threatened breakup of the Libyan state , or a humanitarian catastrophe should the international community consider armed intervention without the invitation of a legitimate Libyan authority . 
This could mean U.S. boots on the ground , but only briefly as part of a broader multilateral effort . 
Leadership in post-Gadhafi Libya should be passed as quickly as possible to the Libyans , who have already set up local councils and a Transitional National Council , which help to organize and provide services in the liberated portions of the country . 
These indigenous institutions merit nurturing and support , including unfreezing of Gadhafi-era assets so that the councils in liberated areas can begin to meet the needs of their populations . 
The post-Gadhafi era has already begun there . 
Libya is a resource-rich country with a relatively well-educated citizenry that has demonstrated courage under fire . 
The country lacks institutions and political experience , but not talent and commitment . 
The international community should prepare to support Libyan efforts to take charge of the country s destiny once Gadhafi leaves the scene . 
This whole war is propaganda right from the start when they declared that armed civilians are being killed in the oppen desert ... strange because in the UK unarmed gangs are criminal what if the youngsters in the UK carried AK74 's RPG 's drove tanks from day 1 -LRB- fact -RRB- and had a UK general defect to his hometown and tribe with 8000 troops including special forces and 100 + tanks jets and fighter helicopters and they all call in dozen powerful armies like some kind of Trojan horse ... this would boil the blood of many civilians that had no say in this war and the government forced to fight this senseless bloodshed full of slander and media spin .

August 12 , 2011 at 12:33 pm | Reply The exercise here is indicative for the western strategic thinking ; `` to think through the challenges that a post-Gadhafi Libya would pose for the United States and its allies . '' 
The task is not `` to think through the challenges that a post-Gadhafi Libya would be for the Libyan People '' . 
It is obvious that NATO 's mission `` Operation Unified Protector '' is to protect western top banking and industry interests . 
NATO simply wants Gadhafi replaced by a `` puppet '' . 
It has NOTHING to do with protecting Libyan civilians ! 
August 13 , 2011 at 3:21 am | Reply In my opinion , the turn of events in Libya is a failure by the United States and NATO to dismantle the legitimate government of Libya . 
DEMOCRACY ist not fought with bombs and weapons . 
DEMOCRACY in my opinion is a peaceful word and should be fought through the ballot box . 
I am for peaceful demonstrations and the freedom of speech . 
I stand strongly against the brutality and Scientific Atrocities that the United States and NATO are committing against the People of Libya . 
I stand for International FREEDOM and JUSTICE . 
The events taking place in Syria are more serious than those in Libya . 
Why is it that NATO and the United States and its allies are till now not taking any effective action against Assad and his regime to stop the Carnage in that country ? 
Justice and equality must prevail . 
Is it because Syria has no oil that the U.S.A. and it 's Allies are marking time with events in Syria ?

2011-08-11,"By the CNN Wire Staff People walk past destroyed buildings on Monday , in Majer , south of Zliten . 
NEW : Rebels made headway Thursday northward toward coastal cities near the capital NEW : Rebel spokesman predicts fighters will reach the road leading to Tripoli within days NEW : Libyan Embassy in Washington reopens under TNC control Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rebels pushed Thursday northward on three fronts toward the coastal cities of al-Zawiya , Aziziya and Sorman , with their ultimate goal being Tripoli , rebel field commander Adel Al-Zintani told CNN . 
Six rebels died and dozens more were wounded in fighting Wednesday and Thursday , he said . 
He predicted that the fighters would reach the coastal road that leads to the capital city within days . 
Zawiya is strategically important because the coastal road through the city is the main supply line from the Tunisian border to areas held by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
Fighting was continuing around Misrata , where rebel spokesman Mohamed Ibrahim said the main hospital reported four rebels killed and 54 wounded . 
Meanwhile , in New York , a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. secretary-general `` is deeply concerned by reports of the unacceptably large number of civilian casualties as a result of the conflict in Libya . '' 
Ban is urging `` all Libyan parties '' to engage with his special envoy , Abdel-Elah Al-Khatib , `` and respond concretely and positively to the ideas presented to them , in order to end the bloodshed in the country , '' the spokesperson said . 
His remarks came three days after allegations that a NATO strike in the village of Majer near Zlitan wound up killing 85 civilians -- 33 children , 32 women and 20 men . 
The Tripoli government called it `` a massaacre '' of civilians ; NATO has said its warplanes struck two farms used as a staging point for Gadhafi 's forces `` This is a legitimate target . 
And by striking it , NATO has reduced pro-Gadhafi forces capabilities to threaten and attack civilians , '' said Col. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for the NATO operation . 
`` We do not have evidence of civilian casualties at this stage , although casualties among military personnel , including mercenaries , are very likely due to the nature of the target . '' 
But , on Tuesday , officials from the government in Tripoli escorted international journalists to a mass funeral in Majer , and to the site where the government and residents said the NATO airstrike killed civilians . 
Journalists saw the bodies of children and women among the dead and wounded at the site of the attack . 
It was impossible for CNN to confirm the extent of the casualties . 
A spokesman for the Tripoli government , Musa Ibrahim , called it `` a crime beyond imagination . '' 
For weeks , NATO warplanes have been bombing Zlitan on a daily basis . 
Meanwhile , rebels have been pressing toward Zlitan 's eastern gates from the nearby opposition-held port of Misrata . 
Speaking to journalists in Majer on Tuesday , Ibrahim accused NATO of bombing Majer to clear the way for rebels to advance on the Gadhafi-controlled city of Zlitan , a few kilometers north . 
Maj. Gen. Nick Pope , spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense , said Thursday that British aircraft have been in action in recent days `` as part of NATO 's mission to protect civilians at risk of attack from Col. Gadhafi 's former regime . '' 
The latest operations included British aircraft carrying out precision airstrikes on several sites in and around Zlitan , Pope said in a statement . 
The report of civilian deaths stirred anger in Washington . 
`` If such reports are true , it further highlights the increased risks to civilians that has occurred as a result of military intervention in Libya and is further evidence that continued bombing by NATO ... is an inappropriate tool to protect civilians or force Moammar Gadhafi from power , '' wrote Rep. Dennis Kucinich in a letter to Ban . 
`` How can they continue to cause the deaths of innocent civilians under the color of international law and not be held accountable ? '' 
the Ohio Democrat continued . 
The changing nature of who controls what in Libya was underscored Thursday by events in Washington , where the Libyan Embassy officially reopened under the control of the Transitional National Council . 
`` This is a message that Gadhafi can no more rule Libya , '' said Ali Aujali , who was accredited Thursday as head of the Libyan mission . 
Aujuli said he talked Thursday with State Department officials about the Obama administration 's efforts to help the TNC gain access to some $ 30 billion in frozen Libyan assets . 
The State Department had ordered the embassy closed in March and expelled diplomats loyal to Gadhafi . 
Aujali had resigned his post as the Gadhafi regime 's ambassador to the United States in February and has since represented the opposition in Washington . 
The United States on July 15 recognized the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya 's rightful government .

2011-08-11,"TUNIS | Thu Aug 11 , 2011 10:51 am EDT TUNIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Tunisia said Thursday its troops were patrolling fuel stations to curb the flow of smuggled gasoline into neighboring Libya , a trade which is helping Muammar Gaddafi hold on to power . 
International sanctions and the effects of Libya 's civil war have disrupted normal supplies of fuel to parts of the country under Gaddafi 's control , but huge volumes of gasoline are instead being smuggled across the Libyan-Tunisian border . 
`` The armed forces are now conducting checks at fuel stations in the south of Tunisia , -LRB- in places -RRB- such as Tataouine and Ben Gardane and Remada , so that neither Tunisians nor Libyans can fill up with large quantities , '' defense ministry official Mokhtar Ben Nasr told a news conference . 
`` These checks are aimed at preventing the smuggling of diesel and gasoline to Libya , '' he said . 
Tunisian police said Wednesday they had seized five container trucks full of contraband fuel which was destined for areas of Libya under Gaddafi 's control . 
Western governments trying to bring an end to Gaddafi 's 41-year rule believe that fuel supplies are crucial to his ability to hold onto power . 
A NATO naval blockade and sanctions that prevent fuel traders from doing business with Libyan companies and individuals on a blacklist have made it extremely difficult for Gaddafi 's administration to bring in fuel by legal means . 
However , smuggling networks help make up the shortfall . 
Libyans buy black-market gasoline in Tunisia , much of which has been smuggled out of neighboring energy producer Algeria , and then carry it across the border into Libya . 
Until now there has been little evidence of Tunisian authorities taking firm action against the illegal trade with Libya . 
Smugglers provide a livelihood for some communities in Tunisia and so they constitute a powerful interest group . 
Any blanket crackdown on fuel smuggling is also likely to hurt the Libyan rebels fighting Gaddafi 's forces . 
Rebels in the Western Mountains region near Tunisia -- who are trying to advance on Tripoli -- depend on fuel smuggled in through a desert border crossing which they control .

2011-08-11,"UNITED NATIONS | Thu Aug 11 , 2011 6:29 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon voiced alarm on Thursday over recent reports of civilians killed in Libya 's civil war and called on all sides to do as much as possible to avoid killing innocent people . 
`` The Secretary-General is deeply concerned by reports of the unacceptably large number of civilian casualties as a result of the conflict in Libya , '' Ban 's press office said in a statement . 
`` The Secretary-General calls on all parties to exercise extreme caution in their actions , in order to minimize any further loss of civilian life , '' the statement said . 
Earlier , the U.N. said Ban had spoken with Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmudi on Wednesday , expressing his concerns about civilian casualties and the `` absolute lack of progress in the efforts to find a politically negotiated solution to the crisis in Libya . '' 
In his latest statement , Ban said `` there can be no military solution to the Libyan crisis . '' 
He called on both sides to respond to ideas for a settlement put to them by his envoy for Libya , Abdel Elah al-Khatib . 
Earlier this week , Russia , India , Brazil and other U.N. Security Council delegations voiced concerns about NATO strikes on Libyan state television last month and other attacks that have allegedly killed civilians . 
Irina Bokova , head of the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO , sharply rebuked NATO on Monday for the attack on Libyan television , which she said killed several people and wounded nearly a dozen . 
`` I deplore the NATO strike on Al-Jamahiriya and its installations , '' Bokova said in a statement . 
`` Media outlets should not be targeted in military actions . '' 
NATO said last month it had bombed three ground-based satellite transmission dishes in Tripoli to silence `` terror broadcasts '' on state television by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi during the uprising against his rule . 
NATO defended the strikes and said it had no evidence anyone had been killed as a result of them .

2011-08-11,"\* Determined to get within striking range of Tripoli \* Signs of NATO strikes SHALGHOUDA , Libya , Aug 11 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebel forces in western Libya drove their offensive north toward the town of Zawiyah near the Mediterranean coast on Thursday , trying to get within striking distance of the capital , Tripoli . 
They pushed north to a settlement called Bir Shuaib , taking them within 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- of their target of Zawiyah , a town less than 50 km from Tripoli , the stronghold of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
`` We 've gone past Nasr village and right now we 're about 25 km from Zawiyah , '' said Faris , a rebel fighter . 
Rebels prevented reporters from getting up to the new front line to see for themselves . 
Evidence of help from NATO air strikes was seen at the village of Shalghouda , on the route of the rebel advance . 
There were signs of recent fighting and a large building had collapsed , apparently after being hit by a NATO bomb or missile . 
A green tent , green army cap and green army uniform lay on the ground among pulverised concrete -- the color of government forces fighting under the flag of Gaddafi 's Libya . 
Rebels said they had taken the village of Nasr , where there was a concentration of pro-Gaddafi forces . 
On the edge of Bir al-Ghanam , south of the new front line , fighters drove by in pick-up trucks and yelled `` Allahu Akbar -LRB- God is greatest -RRB- , victory in Nasr '' . 
At a nearby checkpoint young rebels played football and said they were happy because they expected victory soon . 
There was an array of pick-up trucks with sand oiled on for camouflage . 
Modified helicopter rocket launchers were mounted on the back of the pickup trucks . 
From Misrata , a port city east of the capital controlled by anti-Gaddafi forces , there were unconfirmed reports of a rebel offensive to break through a partial encirclement by Gaddafi forces , striking south in the direction of Tawurgha . 
At least two rebels were killed and over a dozen were wounded there , according to one unofficial report from a source in rebel-held Misrata . 
The rebels in the west have advanced rapidly since capturing Bir al-Ghanam on Saturday , breaking weeks of stalemate on this front in Libya 's civil war . 
Gaddafi 's forces launched Grad rockets at rebel positions in the small desert settlement on Wednesday and rebels fired back with rockets and machine guns . 
Gaddafi describes the rebels as rats and says they are criminals inspired by al Qaeda . 
Thick white smoke was rising at the edge of Bir al-Ghanam during the fighting . 
One rebel was killed and 10 were wounded , doctors said . 
There was no word on government casualties . 
Zawiyah is the hometown of many rebels fighting their way north towards the main highway running parallel to the Mediterranean shore into the heart of Tripoli . 
Rebel reinforcements in jeeps with anti-aircraft guns were brought up to Bir al-Ghanam on Wednesday and both sides exchanged insults over the army radio network .

2011-08-12,"AJDABIYAH , Libya | Fri Aug 12 , 2011 6:11 pm EDT AJDABIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels on the eastern front of Libya 's civil war lost 11 men in the past 24 hours fighting to capture the strategic oil terminal and refinery at Brega on the Mediterranean coast , hospital sources said . 
Sources at a hospital in Ajdabiyah to the northeast said about 50 were wounded on Thursday and Friday and one civilian in the all-but-deserted town was killed when a rocket fired by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces hit a house . 
The rebels have taken the residential zone of New Brega . 
But that is 15 km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from the terminal and port area . 
They hope that capturing the port 750 km east of the capital Tripoli will be a tipping point in their nearly six-month campaign to oust Gaddafi . 
They want to begin exporting oil from Brega as quickly as possible . 
But the battle for it has been going on for months . 
`` There 's close fighting in the oil terminal area this morning but maybe we can finish it off today , '' rebel soldier Mohammad Muftah said . 
Troops loyal to Gaddafi were holding onto the oil facilities , firing rockets at rebel positions . 
Gaddafi is clinging to power despite a near five-month-old NATO air campaign , tightening economic sanctions , and a lengthening war with rebels trying to end his 41-year rule . 
The rebels have seized large swathes of the North African state , but are deeply divided and lack experience , and Thursday 's gains in the east broke weeks of stalemate . 
In the west , rebel forces driving north toward the town of Zawiyah , within striking distance of Gaddafi 's stronghold in the capital , have not moved up from Thursday 's positions . 
Rebels said they had reached the village of Bir Shuaib , some 25 km from Zawiyah , which has unsuccessfully risen up against Gaddafi twice this year . 
Reuters interviewed a captured intelligence officer who said Gaddafi had reinforced Zawiyah , which also has a coastal oil refinery , with about 1,000 conscripts . 
But there were no heavy weapons there and no African mercenaries as rebels insist . 
Brigadier-General Al-Hadi al-Ujaili predicted the rebels would face a hard fight to capture the town . 
He said Gaddafi still enjoys strong support in Tripoli and among Libya 's main tribes , which he said was crucial . 
The western battle is one of three widely separated rebel fronts against Gaddafi forces . 
In the east around the ports of Misrata and Brega , fighting had been bogged down in recent weeks while the western rebels have advanced . 
Zawiyah lies less than 50 km west of Tripoli , on the main road to Tunisia , which has been a lifeline for Libya but has begun to crack down on rampant smuggling of gasoline . 
Rebels in the Western Mountains can muster a few thousand men if their separate units join forces . 
In Misrata , a port on the Mediterranean under rebel control for months and which lies about 580 km west of Brega , six rebel fighters were killed in fighting on Friday . 
Three rebels were killed west of the city where they are fighting to capture Zlitan , a town 160 km east of Tripoli . 
Three other rebels were killed in battles with Gaddafi forces in the town of Tawargha , east of Misrata . 
On the diplomatic front , a Tunisian government official said on Friday there had been contacts last week between U.S. envoys and Gaddafi representatives on Tunisian soil . 
The official , who declined to be named , gave no further details . 
U.S. officials met Gaddafi representatives last month to deliver a message that the embattled Libyan leader must go . 
In an effort to pile economic and military pressure on Gaddafi , more countries are set to announce next week that they will free frozen assets for the rebels , a British official said . 
`` While it 's hard to predict when this will end , it 's easy to see the pressure is building on Gaddafi and it is only a matter of time before he 's forced to leave power , '' the official said . 
Britain is playing a leading role in NATO air strikes against Gaddafi 's forces , which have weakened his armory but have not enabled the rebels to deliver a knockout blow . 
Tightening the economic noose around Gaddafi , Tunisia said on Thursday its troops were patrolling fuel stations to curb the flow of smuggled gasoline into neighboring Libya . 
International sanctions and the effects of Libya 's civil war have disrupted normal supplies of fuel to parts of the country under Gaddafi 's control , but huge volumes of gasoline are instead being smuggled across the Libyan-Tunisian border .

Full Article Gaddafi forces still hold Brega oil terminal , refinery BENGHAZI , Libya | Fri Aug 12 , 2011 6:37 pm IST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Troops loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi are still in control of the oil terminal and refinery of the strategic eastern port of Brega despite rebel advances , a spokesman for rebel forces said on Friday . 
The two sides have been battling for months over Brega , 750 km east of Tripoli . 
The rebels see securing the oil facilities as a tipping point in the war and hope to resume oil exports from there as quickly as possible . 
Rebels said they had captured a residential area of Brega on Thursday . 
But spokesman Mohammed Zawawi told reporters it was still not safe to go into the city . 
The oil terminal is about 15 kms -LRB- about 10 miles -RRB- from the residential district . 
`` Now we 're trying to clear that area . 
There are some Gaddafi troops still there , '' said Mohammed Zawawi .

2011-08-13,"By the CNN Wire Staff A Libyan mourner fires shots in the air at a cemetery on August 12 during the funeral of five rebels killed in the battle for the control of the oil-rich town of Brega . 
NEW : Government spokesman : Al-Zawiya is `` absolutely under our control '' Rebels say they are in control of the coastal city of al-Zawiya Rebels say they captured the town of Garyan to the south A government spokesman calls the rebel efforts `` weak '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rebels said Saturday that they were gaining traction in a series of offensives in several parts of Libya controlled by ruler Moammar Gadhafi -- claims that the Libyan government swiftly disputed . 
Heavy gunfire was heard in al-Zawiya , located about 33 miles west of Tripoli , where rebels had arrived . 
Rebels entered the city center and managed to cut off the road to Tripoli , they said . 
Talha Jwaili , a rebel fighter , told CNN that rebels control al-Zawiya . 
Ten rebels died in the fighting , four from Zintan and six from al-Zawiya , he said . 
More than 20 people were reported injured . 
A spokesman in the media office of the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region said that rebels control about 85 % of the city and that clashes there are ongoing . 
CNN could not independently confirm Saturday who was in control of al-Zawiya , nor other details of the rebels ' accounts . 
A government spokesman downplayed the fighting , telling reporters in Tripoli that the town is `` absolutely under our control . '' 
Al-Zawiya is strategically important because the coastal road through the city is the main supply line from the Tunisian border to areas held by Gadhafi . 
His weapon of choice ? 
His brush Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said fewer than 100 rebels moved in on al-Zawiya from the southern side of the city , but were stopped . 
Another group of fewer than 50 rebels was waiting inside the city , but `` took action too early , '' he said , adding that the group is still on the run . 
`` They are mad . 
... This is not an advance . 
This is what you call a skirmish , what you call a suicide mission , '' Ibrahim said , noting that al-Zawiya is the country 's third-largest city . 
While forces loyal to the Libyan leader tried to defend the capital from the west , rebels announced that they had cut off an important military supply route to the south . 
Sixty miles to Tripoli 's south , rebels said they captured the town of Garyan and pushed the Gadhafi forces to the south , cutting them off from the road to Tripoli . 
The soldiers left behind heavy artillery and ammunition , rebel field commander Adel al-Zintani told CNN . 
`` We captured many anti-aircraft artillery vehicles , two full fuel tankers and 106 anti-tank piercing artillery and shells , '' he said . 
Seven people were injured in the clashes , he said . 
`` The rebels have 95 % control of Garyan and have surrounded a Gadhafi brigade inside a military camp inside Garyan , '' said the spokesman in the media office of the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region . 
Finally , in the opposition-held port of Misrata , missile attacks by Gadhafi forces ended after rebels captured the nearby town of Tawargha , National Transitional Council spokesman Guma El-Gamaty told CNN . 
That city was being used by Gadhafi forces to launch missiles indiscriminately into Misrata , he said . 
Rebels also took a crucial bridge that links Tawargha to Sirte , Gadhafi 's hometown and loyal stronghold , he said . 
However , Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said government fighters had pushed the rebels away from Tawargha and back to Misrata . 
Ibrahim also downplayed the rebel claims in other towns . 
`` Small groups of armed gangs , 50 here , 50 there , some attacked south of al-Zawiya , some attacked north of Garyan , and Tawargha , but they have very weak influence on the ground , '' government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters . 
`` The people 's armed forces are dealing with them , they do not represent a real threat . 
Tripoli is safe . '' 
He later noted that Gadhafi 's forces are `` very strong '' and have the support of `` thousands upon thousands '' of armed volunteers . 
`` You have to remember we are very powerful , '' Ibrahim said . 
`` The tens of thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers are armed right now . 
It does n't matter whether NATO advances or not , whether rebels advance or not , because we will always be able to fight , in a year 's time , in two years , in three years . '' 
Five months into the Libyan war , the rebels have won international support in their effort to oust Gadhafi . 
They have been aided by NATO airstrikes that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that ordered civilians be protected . 
This week , the government accused NATO of killing 85 civilians , including 33 children , in airstrikes Monday near the embattled city of Zlitan . 
NATO has said there is no evidence that the strikes killed civilians , though journalists , including CNN reporters , taken by Gadhafi 's government to the site of the strikes , reported seeing bodies of women and children . 
It was impossible for CNN to confirm the extent of the casualties and if they were all civilian . 
Kaim on Friday criticized the United Nations for what he claimed was an organizational silence over claims that NATO has violated the mandate of the Security Council by killing civilians and conducting a naval blockade . 
Ibrahim renewed the government 's accusations Saturday , saying NATO is aiding the rebels , whom he described as `` armed gangs . '' 
The comments follow a statement a day earlier by a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon , who said the U.N. secretary-general `` is deeply concerned by reports of the unacceptably large number of civilian casualties as a result of the conflict in Libya . '' 
Ban urged `` all Libyan parties '' to engage with his special envoy , Abdel-Elah Al-Khatib , `` and respond concretely and positively to the ideas presented to them , in order to end the bloodshed in the country , '' the spokesperson said . 
Ibrahim repeated Saturday his own calls for an end to the conflict , telling NATO : `` Stop this aggression and let 's talk peace . ''

2011-08-13,"Political art is springing up in rebel-held areas of Libya Artists are expressing their opposition to Moammar Gadhafi The paintings show Gadhafi as a ruthless dictator `` Some people fight . 
I use a brush , '' says one artist Zintan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In all his years in power , Moammar Gadhafi has never been portrayed as anything but regal in paintings and statues scattered throughout Libya . 
Six months into Libya 's war , some artists in rebel strongholds are arming themselves with fresh paint . 
A brush can be as mighty as the Kalashnikov in the fight against the strongman . 
`` Everybody supports the revolution in some way , '' says Mohammed Zamoul , formerly a bulldozer driver . 
`` Some people fight , I use the brush . '' 
In Tripoli , a massive mural of Gadhafi remains intact . 
Zamoul 's work is far less flattering . 
Gallery : Rebel art in Libya His caricatures of Gadhafi sucking on his country 's oil reserves , pinned down by a rebel flag and being launched out of Libya on a bomb -- are everywhere around his hometown of Rujban in the country 's western mountains . 
`` Building owners welcome it , '' he says . 
`` Not one single person said no. . 
I get a lot of support . '' 
Several miles away in the rebel-controlled city of Zintan , Masoud Baji is also using art as weapon . 
He was a calligrapher before the uprising began in Libya last February . 
Now , he revels in his new career . 
Each of his paintings , he says , expresses Gadhafi 's persecution of the Libyan people . 
One portrays Gadhafi as a vampire sucking the wealth of the people . 
`` He has not left anything for them , he kept us illiterate , without education , '' Baji says . 
`` He kept everything for himself . '' 
Some of the paintings are humorous . 
Some make strong political commentary . 
All are new in a nation where freedom of expression was an unknown under Gadhafi . 
`` Now we can express ourselves freely , thank god , '' Baji says . 
`` The chains have been lifted . 
Everyone can express themselves . 
Even a simple painting about the tyrant , now we can paint . 
Before the revolution we could not do that , he would arrest and in some cases kill us . '' 
Zamoul and his assistant , calligrapher Abdul Aziz , bear sizzling daytime temperatures to create their latest fresco -- `` The Lady of the Sea '' beckoning rebel fighters to come and join her in Tripoli . 
`` What I have inside I can now express and put it on the walls , '' Zamoul says . 
In this particular expression , he has , perhaps , captured the heart of the Libyan rebels , fighting bitterly to make it Tripoli .

2011-08-14,"By the CNN Wire Staff A Libyan mourner fires shots in the air at a cemetery on August 12 during the funeral of five rebels killed in battle . 
A CNN photojournalist is caught in the gunfire outside al-Zawiya Conflicting reports emerge over control of the town The group is eventually forced to return to Tunisia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- About an hour and a half into his trip from the Tunisian border to Tripoli on Saturday , CNN photojournalist Craig Johnston sensed something was about to change . 
`` The two government drivers -- they would n't say much to us , '' said Johnston , who was in a bus ferrying fellow journalists from Sky News and Reuters from Djerba to the Libyan capital . 
`` It was a little bit tense . '' 
Johnston said he began to notice armed men massing along the road , and large amounts of civilian traffic traveling in the opposite direction . 
`` I could sense the tension was getting worse , '' he said . 
Libyan rebels advance on Zawiya Ten minutes later , the bus drove directly into a firefight outside the coastal city of al-Zawiya . 
Rebels said Saturday that they had entered the key coastal city 33 miles west of Tripoli , with some claiming they are now in control of up to 85 % of it . 
The government strongly denied those claims . 
The drivers of the bus tried to flee the fighting as soldiers ran down the road , yelling , `` Go , go , go ! '' 
But they were hemmed in by civilian traffic . 
Eventually , after a series of turns amid the gunfire , the bus drivers maneuvered away from the danger . 
The situation lasted about 20 minutes . 
Once safely away from the fighting , they stopped to regroup , with one of the drivers going to pray at a mosque . 
As they left the scene , black smoke rose from points along the road . 
It was unclear whether it was the result of NATO airstrikes or continued fighting in the area . 
The group was back in Djerba on Saturday night after being told to leave Libya . 
"
2011-08-16,"NEW : U.S. says Libya fired Scud missile Sunday Spokesman says official 's decision to leave was `` personal '' `` It 's quite hard to say who is in complete control , '' says reporter about al-Zawiya Report : Libya 's interior minister arrives in Cairo on a private plane Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A senior government official arrived Monday in Cairo amid rumors that he had defected , Egypt 's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported . 
Nasr al-Mabrouk Abdallah arrived with nine of his family members on a private plane from Djerba , Tunisia , the newspaper reported , citing an unidentified airport official . 
Djerba is about 150 miles -LRB- 240 kilometers -RRB- west of Tripoli . 
Meanwhile , a U.S. defense official confirmed Monday that Libyan forces loyal to Gadhafi fired a short-range Scud missile on Sunday at a rebel stronghold , but by all accounts the missile failed to reach its target . 
The official said the missile was launched from a government-held area 50 miles east of Sirte and landed 50 miles east of Brega in the desert . 
His weapon of choice ? 
His brush The newspaper and an official at Cairo International Airport identified Abdallah as Libya 's minister of the interior . 
However , a Libyan government official -- whose information has proved reliable in the past but who is not allowed to talk to the news media for attribution -- identified Abdallah as an administrative director at the Interior Ministry and a former Libyan minister . 
The official said he could confirm that Abdallah had traveled to Egypt with his family on nonofficial business , but could not specify the nature of the trip . 
A Libyan government website reported in June that Abdallah had been sworn in as deputy minister of public security . 
Libya 's interior ministry is called the Ministry of Public Security . 
Asked about the apparent defection , Tripoli government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said he would not comment on any personal decisions by Abdallah . 
`` In the last while , we noticed that he had intense social pressures on him . 
It 's probably not appropriate that we talk about it in detail because it 's personal . '' 
Ibrahim added , `` Truthfully , he has fallen under a lot of social and emotional pressure as we 've noticed . 
He could n't handle it and preferred that he left . 
That 's a personal decision . '' 
Abdallah 's departure comes as rebels have been reporting major advances toward their goal of cutting off Libya 's coastal road , the Tripoli regime 's lifeline , and reaching the capital . 
In the coastal city of al-Zawiya , clashes were ongoing . 
`` At the moment , it 's quite hard to say who is in complete control of the city , '' said Deborah Haynes , a reporter for the Times of London who left the city Monday . 
`` The rebels say they have 80 % of it under their control , but it is a very fluid situation . '' 
Pro-Gadhafi snipers were holed up in buildings in the main square , where rebels were firing at them with rocket-propelled grenades , she said . 
Rebel fighters controlled all but the eastern part of the city , said Hassan Jwaili , who is a rebel fighter and a source who has proven reliable in the past . 
Gadhafi forces shelled al-Zawiya with Grad rockets from nearby Janzur , killing two rebels , bringing the number of dead in al-Zawiya to 11 , with dozens more wounded , Jwaili said . 
NATO airstrikes , though , have hit Gadhafi forces in Janzur , aiding the rebels , he said . 
West of al-Zawiya , rebel forces entered the towns of Surman and Sabrata late Sunday , Jwaili said . 
Twenty-two rebel fighters died and 38 were wounded in the towns , he said . 
West of Sabrata , rebels surrounded Gadhafi forces inside a military camp , he said . 
Clashes were continuing for control of Tiji , on the plains of the western mountains , Jwaili said . 
And in Assaba , east of Qawalish , also in the western mountains , rebel fighters had surrounded the city and negotiations were under way for Gadhafi forces to turn themselves in , Jwaili said . 
But a Tripoli government spokesman denied the assertions that rebels were advancing . 
Gadhafi himself , in an address broadcast Monday on Libyan state television , urged Libyans to fight opposition forces and `` cleanse this sweet and honorable land . '' 
Cheers from the crowd accompanied the speech , cries of `` Allah , Libya , Gadhafi and nothing else '' at times drowning out Gadhafi . 
`` We dance and sing despite the strikes ! 
The strikes will be over and NATO will be defeated , '' Gadhafi said . 
`` Move always forward to the challenge ; pick up your weapons ; go to the fight in order to liberate Libya inch by inch from the traitors and from NATO . 
Be prepared to fight if they hit the ground . '' 
Claims of control over the city of al-Zawiya -- if true -- would be a strategic blow against government forces , since the road through the city serves as a critical supply line to Tripoli from the west and has an oil terminal . 
In his news conference Monday evening , Ibrahim denied the assertions and said Gadhafi forces were in `` complete control '' of al-Zawiya after having halted rebel attacks there . 
`` There are a few armed gangs inside the city who took advantage of the opportunity to enter but they are limited , '' he said . 
`` All of south Zawiya is protected . 
The armed gangs tried to attack people in their homes , occupy a school and raid shops . 
The government closed off a main road for the protection of the people . '' 
The rebels say that they were the ones who closed the coastal road . 
Ibrahim said heavy NATO airstrikes were continuing to strike some coastal cities , including al-Zawiya , with the eastern city of al-Brega bearing the brunt of the attacks . 
`` To be honest , they 're unable to shake our civilians or our youth , '' he said . 
He said the rebels suffered heavy casualties . 
`` Hundreds of them injured and tens killed . 
Because of this , now people in the eastern regions and even the armed gangs refer to al-Brega as a cemetery . 
Al-Brega is synonymous with death . '' 
In Tiji , 40 rebels were killed by pro-Gadhafi forces , who took three tanks and a number of weapons from them , he said . 
Ibrahim said officials were negotiating with international companies that have expressed interest in returning to Libya , he said . 
The goal is for them to resume operations `` very soon . '' 
Ibrahim added that the Tripoli government forces were planning to `` free '' the key port city of Misrata from rebel forces . 
`` We ca n't tell everything but we 're in a position to free Misrata , '' he said . 
`` It 's not an easy feat . '' 
Rebel commander al-Zintani rejected Ibrahim 's assertions that Gadhafi 's forces controlled al-Zawiya and Surman , which is also along the western supply road , as well as the government 's claims to Garyan , another city on a key supply route leading to Tripoli from the south . 
`` The next few days will prove him wrong , '' the rebel field commander predicted . 
NATO said Sunday it had struck a Gadhafi military facility in Garyan . 
Rebel spokesman Jumma Ibrahim has said that rebels control the coastal road connecting al-Zawiya with a post on the Tunisia border , but that Gadhafi forces still controlled the post . 
Reports from Tunisia 's state-owned Tataouine radio corroborated the account . 
CNN has not been able to independently confirm battle claims , including who controls al-Zawiya . 
Daily claims of rebel successes indicate rapid progress when compared with positions rebels claimed on previous days . 
The government in Tripoli has consistently downplayed claims of rebel victories and played up the strength of Gadhafi 's forces . 
`` You have to remember we are very powerful , '' Musa Ibrahim said Saturday . 
`` The tens of thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers are armed right now . 
It does n't matter whether NATO advances or not , whether rebels advance or not , because we will always be able to fight , in a year 's time , in two years , in three years . '' 
Five months into the Libyan war , the rebels have won international support in their effort to oust Gadhafi . 
They have been aided by NATO airstrikes that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that ordered civilians be protected .

2011-08-16,"By the CNN Wire Staff Video : Libyan rebels free prisoners The battle for Zawiya is called `` urban warfare '' Rebel forces in Tripoli are awaiting the `` zero hour , '' a spokesman says Some Gadhafi forces are going to Tripoli from other fronts Secretary of State Clinton expresses optimism Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Over the past few days , anti-Gadhafi forces have made `` significant advances '' -- in the northwest and in the regions of Misrata and al-Brega -- a spokesman for NATO 's military operation told reporters Tuesday . 
`` Anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli , '' said Col. Roland Lavoie , who described the advances as `` the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months . '' 
Since the end of July , as the threat from pro-Gadhafi forces has diminished , thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western Nafusa mountains , he said . 
Since Friday , the northwest coastal city of Misrata has been free of pro-Gadhafi forces , he said . 
And the threat from nearby Zlitan has diminished as pro-Gadhafi forces are being pushed farther west , he added . 
His weapon of choice ? 
His brush Over the last week , NATO warplanes have damaged or destroyed some 150 military targets as part of Operation Unified Protector , Lavoie said . 
`` Our assessment , without going into details , is that the Gadhafi regime does not have anymore an effective operational capability , '' he said . 
Lavoie said that rebels had occupied Surman and Sabratha west of Tripoli , but added that the regions were `` still contested . '' 
However , Libyan state television reported that pro-Gadhafi forces and tribal fighters were `` cleansing the city of Sabratha from the gangs of traitors '' and had secured the coastal road , a key supply pipeline into Tripoli . 
Though the center of Zawiya was under rebel control , `` there 's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs , '' Lavoie said . 
Still , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed optimism . 
`` I think the sense is that Gadhafi 's days are numbered , '' she told reporters in Washington . 
But a spokesman for the Gadhafi government offered a different view . 
`` We are doing very well , '' Ibrahim Musa told reporters . 
`` It 's true that it 's a bit slow -- people are still saying that we 're not acting immediately and that we 're having problems in Surman and Sabratha and whatnot because of armed gangs . 
That 's true but , God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully . 
We will achieve peace and victory . '' 
He added , `` We are fighting NATO -- not the tens or hundreds of armed gang members . 
Our war is with the crusaders . '' 
If rebels gain control of Zawiya , that would be a major stride in putting a stranglehold on the Gadhafi-controlled seat of power . 
`` We will be very careful entering Tripoli , which we hope to do by the end of this month , '' said Col. Ahmed Banni , military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council . 
Banni said there is intelligence that some Gadhafi forces are moving to Tripoli from other fronts -- Terhouna in the southeast and Sirte farther east . 
He said those forces have taken off their uniforms to blend in with the population , a `` dangerous '' sign those troops are preparing for a `` bloody war . '' 
He said rebels in Tripoli recently were supplied with arms . 
But , he said , `` We asked them to stay put until the zero hour . '' 
Col. Jumma Ibrahim , a spokesman for the rebels ' western command , said Gadhafi forces controlled most of the eastern part of the city and were shelling rebels with Grad missiles and artillery . 
`` There are still skirmishes with the brigades in the city center , with snipers taking positions , '' Col. Ibrahim said . 
`` The fight is now urban warfare there at the moment . 
There have been a lot injured among our ranks but it is hard to give a number . '' 
The rebels claim control of towns west of Zawiya to near Ras Jedeir . 
These include Surman and Subratha . 
`` It is a huge deal and a decisive defeat for his forces in that region . 
All these areas are liberated , '' Banni said . 
Col. Ibrahim said Garyan , south of Tripoli 's city center , had been taken by rebels but Gadhafi loyalists were shelling them from a nearby town . 
There has been `` fierce fighting '' in Terhouna . 
He said rebel forces were surrounding Zlitan in the south , east and northeast and fighting Gadhafi forces . 
He said there 's been fighting in the industrial area of al-Brega , where rebels control the residential areas except for one controlled by the Gadhafi government . 
Gadhafi forces also control the industrial area , Banni said . 
`` He is trying his hardest to prevent us from access to $ 35 million worth of daily oil money under normal circumstances in al-Brega , '' Banni said . 
`` If we control the port and the refinery in the industrial area , we 'd have that money . ''

2011-08-16,"Residents often said everything was great : `` mia mia '' Was it a coping method or a survival tactic under Gadhafi ? 
Watson says he watched slow destruction of a country Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Mia mia . '' 
It is an extremely popular phrase , widely used in Libya , that translates roughly to `` 100 percent . '' 
Nine times out of 10 , that is what Libyans said when I asked how they were coping with nightly bombardments by NATO warplanes , electricity blackouts that lasted days and rebel forces who were pressing forward on three fronts . 
`` Mia mia , '' they said with a smile . 
In other words , everything 's great ! 
Was this the cheerful coping method of a society living amid olive groves and palm trees next to the Mediterranean Sea ? 
Or was `` mia mia '' a survival tactic for people who had grown up within the authoritarian system of Moammar Gadhafi 's perpetual revolution ? 
The whispers of dissent my colleagues and I often heard in Tripoli suggested the latter . 
One night , after we had filmed the largest poster ever of a head of state in Tripoli 's Green Square , a middle-aged man rode past on a bicycle , yelling , `` Do n't believe what you see ! 
It 's all lies ! '' 
Then he disappeared into traffic , swallowed up amid posters of Gadhafi and regime loyalists , who shrouded themselves in the green of the Libyan flag . 
His weapon of choice ? 
His brush Even in peacetime , Gadhafi 's Libya had the Orwellian trappings of a police state governed by a culture of fear . 
I first traveled to Tripoli in 2007 , when I was greeted at passport control by a portrait of Gadhafi in sunglasses and the revolutionary slogan `` Partners not Wage-Slaves . '' 
At the time , Libya was coming in from the cold after years of international isolation . 
U.S. diplomats opening a new American Embassy were temporarily housed in a sky-high suite of the pricey Corinthia Hotel . 
Meanwhile , European businessmen were downstairs in the hotel lobby , plotting ways to profit off bountiful Libyan petro-dollars . 
The foreigners were free to make deals with the government . 
But Libyans were still clearly afraid to say much beyond the mantra of `` mia mia . '' 
Gadhafi 's cult of personality reigned supreme . 
During that visit , I watched a highly placed engineer and an academic at a government `` think tank '' separately feign illness rather than speak on the record about their country . 
Even though I had jumped through bureaucratic hoops , acquiring all the necessary permits from the Foreign Press Department to conduct interviews , these adult , educated men were terrified about sticking their necks out and perhaps saying something that might accidentally challenge Gadhafi 's utopian vision of Libya . 
After all , in the 1980s , Gadhafi banned restaurants , lawyers and the entire retail sector . 
Now he had performed an ideological U-turn and was apparently embracing capitalism . 
In 2007 , I had to travel everywhere with a government minder . 
I was permitted to spend only a single night reporting in the eastern city of Benghazi before being hustled back to Tripoli . 
The regime 's discomfort was prescient . 
Four years later , the barely contained political tensions in Benghazi exploded , and Libya 's second city became the capital for anti-Gadhafi rebels . 
Some Libyans clearly had had enough of `` mia mia . '' 
It was surprising , then , to see the Gadhafi regime still hosting journalists from the U.S. , France and England five months into an aerial bombing campaign that had been led by these three governments . 
The government was trying to shape international opinion . 
But it was doing so with the clumsiness one would expect from a regime that enjoyed absolute control over its own media for more than 40 years . 
Throughout the conflict , almost all foreign journalists have been housed in the luxury Rixos Hotel , which lost its Turkish management after Ankara turned its back on Gadhafi several months into the war . 
The only time we were allowed to film outside of the hotel was on government bus tours , surrounded by government escorts . 
Oftentimes , we would n't learn about the destination until the last minute . 
It was like trying to see Libya through a keyhole . 
When the regime did n't like our subsequent reporting , it did not hesitate to insult and intimidate . 
`` I think you are an agent of NATO . 
You work for Hillary Clinton , '' the head of the foreign media department told me when he summoned me to his office for one of several hourlong lectures . 
`` You are a criminal ! '' 
yelled his young assistant Issa . 
They were furious at my reported estimate that `` more than 10,000 '' regime supporters attended a recent pro-Gadhafi rally . 
They would have preferred the headline printed in the regime 's English-language Al-Jamahiriya News : `` More than Five Million Libyans organized in the Marches . '' 
Considering Libya 's entire population is estimated at just over 6 million , Al-Jamahiriya 's alleged rally would have been a remarkable event to witness , especially when broad swaths of the country were still under the control of the rebels . 
Sometimes , the bus tours backfired . 
On a visit to the front-line city of Zlitan , government officials brought us to a law school that had clearly been bombed by NATO warplanes . 
It was , they said , yet another example of the Western military alliance bombing a civilian target . 
But the campus of the bombed-out school was littered with military uniforms and empty wooden ammunition boxes . 
`` Those belonged to the school 's security guards , '' said a minder . 
We asked outside military experts to examine the serial numbers on the ammo boxes . 
They all agreed that Cyrillic letters clearly showed that one box had contained Russian-made 14.5 millimeter armor-piercing incendiary B-32 rounds . 
These are high-caliber munitions for the kind of machine gun that is typically mounted on armored personnel carriers and anti-aircraft guns . 
`` The guard would need to be about 3 meters tall to carry the gun for those , '' security analyst Zoran Kusovac wrote in an e-mail to CNN . 
`` But if Hulk Hogan was the guard ... '' The trouble is , the regime 's habit of exaggeration and outright lies was often matched by the outrageous claims of the rebels . 
The opposition fighters often claimed to control cities that later proved to be in loyalist hands . 
After last month 's killing of rebel military commander Abdul Fattah Younis , the Benghazi-based Transitional National Council issued wildly contradictory statements . 
Eventually , it emerged that a rival rebel faction killed Younis and set his corpse on fire before dumping it in a valley . 
NATO did n't help matters in the truth department . 
Throughout the conflict , Western governments stuck to their argument that NATO 's mission was to `` save civilian lives . '' 
But the aerial bombardment of loyalist positions just before rebels launched offensives against Gadhafi-held towns hardly resembled life-saving operations . 
Add that to the crippling economic blockade of Tripoli , and suddenly NATO 's mission appeared to be focused more on regime change than on protecting innocent civilians . 
The Libyan government could make a strong case that NATO had exceeded the mandate provided by a United Nations Security Council Resolution . 
But the Gadhafi regime was so obsessed with not appearing weak that it refused to let journalists see the hardships endured by Libyan citizens . 
I saw the extent of the crippling power shortages only when I sneaked out of the Rixos one night . 
In downtown Tripoli , I was stunned to see an entire neighborhood plunged into darkness , with families breaking their Ramadan fast by candlelight . 
Residents told me they had n't had any electricity in days . 
We also started hearing rumors of protests due to the lack of power . 
I asked Libya 's prime minister about these reports at a news conference the next day . 
`` The only rallies that came out on the streets in the last few days were those supporting the leadership of the country , '' Baghdadi Al-Mahmoudi said . 
`` Libyans are able to hold firm against these sanctions and this aggression . '' 
Another `` mia mia '' moment from one of the highest-ranked officials in the land . 
And who could challenge him ? 
As early as March , the regime shut down Internet access and cell phone text messaging throughout the entire country . 
One of the only exceptions was the Rixos Hotel , where government minders came to check their e-mail -LRB- and charge their cell phones , as the power shortages got worse -RRB- . 
The Rixos was where Libyan state TV talk show host Yousef Shakeer lived with his family . 
He broadcast from a studio in the basement , serving up nightly denunciations of NATO , the rebels and the foreign journalists in the hotel ... while predicting Gadhafi 's imminent victory over his enemies . 
Every night , gunfire rang out around the Rixos . 
Asked what it was , government officials always said , `` They are supporters of Gadhafi celebrating victory . '' 
Celebrating five months of near-constant victory must have been exhausting . 
When NATO 's nightly bombing runs struck closer to the Rixos , the strange collection of regime supporters who somehow could afford $ 400-a-night hotel rooms sometimes lashed out at foreign reporters . 
`` F -- off ! '' 
a Libyan man screamed at CNN producer Jomana Karadsheh , as she ran to film 2 a.m. explosions from the roof . 
Later , he apologized when he learned that Jomana was Jordanian . 
Seen through this bizarre lens and surrounded by antagonistic ideologues , reporters ended up questioning themselves on everything they saw . 
Was that person I interviewed actually a government agent ? 
Were the dead people in those coffins really civilians killed by last night 's airstrikes ? 
How many people really supported Gadhafi ? 
Imagine my surprise when on one of my last days in Libya , I sneaked away from government minders in the neighborhood of Souk al Jumma , which has been the scene of anti-Gadhafi street protests . 
There , I met a man named Tahir who told me he was being patient , waiting for the rebels to come from the Nafusa Mountains and Misrata to liberate Tripoli . 
`` Lies , all lies , '' he said when I asked him about the wild crowds of Gadhafi supporters broadcast nightly on Libyan state TV . 
`` Thank you , Britain ; thank you , America , '' a group of teenagers playing foosball yelled to Jomana and cameraman Joe Duran in another part of Souk al Juma . 
The best argument I ever heard for defending the dictator came from an interpreter named Mohamed . 
He was worried about his family 's safety , having heard rumors of rebels attacking dark-skinned Libyans . 
Never having worked with the rebels , I could not confirm or deny Mohamed 's claim . 
But it raised the specter of racial and tribal conflict in the event of Gadhafi 's overthrow . 
`` Report the truth , please , '' a Libyan man standing in line told me as a Tunisian customs officer processed my passport last week . 
I was about to leave Libya and at the end of my rope after a month of virtual house arrest . 
`` What is the truth ? '' 
`` Mia mia ?! '' No , the man said . 
He was fleeing to Tunisia with his family because there was no electricity in Tripoli and because Gadhafi 's forces had opened fire with machine guns on a recent street protest against the power outages . 
Another claim I could not independently confirm . 
For now , only one thing is certain . 
During my month in Libya , I watched a country slowly being destroyed , city by city , town by town . 
It does n't matter whether the damage is being caused by warplanes , rebel machine guns , loyalist rockets or the sudden departure of the foreign guest workers and educated Libyans who kept the economy working . 
The fact is , Libya is starting to look and feel more and more like another Arab country whose long-ruling dictator was overthrown with the help of foreign armies .

Full Article Gaddafi forces fire Scud missile : U.S. official BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue Aug 16 , 2011 5:46 pm IST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fired a Scud missile for the first time in the country 's civil war , a U.S. defense official said , after rebel advances left the Libyan leader isolated in his capital . 
Rebels fighting to end Gaddafi 's 41-year rule seized two strategic towns near Tripoli over the past two days , cutting the city off from its supply lines and leaving the Libyan leader with a dwindling set of options if he is to stay in power . 
However , pro-Gaddafi forces were encountering a fight-back in one of those towns , Zawiyah , west of Tripoli . 
A Reuters reporter nearby said he heard a salvo of four Russian-made Grad rockets landing in the town on Tuesday . 
The Scud missile was fired on Sunday morning from a location about 50 miles -LRB- 80 km -RRB- east of Sirte , Gaddafi 's home town , and landed east of the coastal oil town of Brega where rebels are fighting for control , the U.S. official said . 
The missile came down in the desert , injuring no one , said the official , who was speaking on condition of anonymity . 
There was no immediate comment from the government in Tripoli . 
Firing the missile , which poses little military threat because it is so inaccurate , is evidence of the Gaddafi administration 's desperation , said Shashank Joshi , Associate Fellow at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute . 
`` It 's an obvious sign that the regime 's back is to the wall , '' he said . 
In the six months of fighting up to now , Gaddafi 's forces have been using short-range Grad rockets but have not before deployed Scud missiles , which have an estimated range of about 185 miles -LRB- 300 km -RRB- . 
In the rebel headquarters in the eastern city of Benghazi , officials said the Scud firing was a sign Gaddafi would do anything to protect his power . 
`` Gaddafi troops are using his last gun . 
He 's crazy , '' said Mohammad Zawawi , media director for rebel forces . 
`` We 're scared he 'll use chemicals . 
That 's why we 're trying to end this war and we hope to end it with the least number of casualties . '' 
`` We ca n't prevent the scuds but we hope NATO can . 
NATO has the technology to detect them . '' 
Analysts say the rebels ' strategy now is to isolate the capital and hope the government will collapse , but they say it is possible too that Gaddafi will opt to stage a last-ditch fight for the capital . 
In a barely audible telephone call to state television in the early hours of Monday morning , Gaddafi called on his followers to liberate Libya from rebels and their NATO supporters . 
`` Get ready for the fight ... The blood of martyrs is fuel for the battlefield , '' he said . 
He was speaking as rebels made their most dramatic advances in months of fighting , shifting the momentum in a conflict that had been largely static and was testing the patience of NATO powers anxious for a swift outcome . 
Rebel forces in the Western Mountains south of Tripoli surged forward at the weekend to enter Zawiyah . 
The town is about 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and , crucially , straddles the main highway linking the capital to Tunisia . 
A day later , rebels said they had captured the town of Garyan , which controls the highway leading south from Tripoli and linking it to Sabha , a Gaddafi stronghold deep in the desert . 
`` Gaddafi has been isolated . 
He has been cut off from the outside world , '' a rebel spokesman from the Western Mountains , called Abdulrahman , told Reuters by telephone . 
Early on Tuesday , rebels on the outskirts of Zawiyah said forces loyal to Gaddafi were still on the eastern edge of the town , from where they have been attacking with mortars , Grad rockets and sniper fire . 
Medical workers at one of the town 's hospitals said 20 people , a mixture of rebel fighters and civilians , were killed on Monday , and the death toll for Tuesday had reached one . 
Officials in Tripoli deny Zawiyah is under rebel control , but government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim acknowledged on state television that rebel fighters were in Garyan . 
`` There are still armed gangs inside the city . 
We are able to drive them out , '' he said . 
A U.N. envoy arrived in neighbouring Tunisia , where sources say rebels and representatives of the government have been holed up on the island resort of Djerba for negotiations . 
Tunisia 's official news agency on Tuesday quoted the envoy , Abdel Elah al-Khatib , as saying he knew nothing of any negotiations in Djerba . 
Speaking in Tunis , he said he held informal talks with representatives of Gaddafi 's government and the rebel council . 
The envoy did not say who they were or what they discussed . 
Gaddafi 's spokesman denied Tripoli was in talks about the leader 's departure , saying reports of such negotiations were the product of a `` media war '' being waged against Libya . 
Talks could signal the endgame of a civil war that has drawn in the NATO alliance and emerged as one of the bloodiest confrontations in the wave of unrest sweeping the Arab world . 
Rebels may still lack the manpower for an all-out assault on Tripoli , but are hoping their encirclement of the capital will bring down Gaddafi 's government or inspire an uprising . 
In the past , however , they have frequently failed to hold gains , and a fightback by Gaddafi troops could yet force them back . 
Pro-Gaddafi residents of the capital remain defiant . 
Makhjoub Muftah , a school teacher who has signed up as a gun-toting pro-Gaddafi volunteer , like many others seemed to think a rebel advance into Tripoli was a remote possibility . 
`` I wish they would march into Tripoli . 
I wish , '' he said , daring the rebels . 
`` They will all die . ''

2011-08-16,"LONDON | Tue Aug 16 , 2011 11:28 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Tripoli might be cut off and Libya 's war moving to its endgame , but even if Muammar Gaddafi avoids a bloody finish his departure could usher in a new period of instability and uncertainty . 
Libya 's rebels said on Tuesday they had completed moves to cut off roads to the capital after rapid advances in the west . 
The defection of a senior Gaddafi security official further reinforced the image of crumbling central authority . 
But analysts , oil companies and Western governments worry that the opposition , too , remains riven by internal division that could prompt new fighting , jeopardizing both post-war recovery and the resumption of oil exports . 
While sources say members of the opposition and government have held secret meetings in Tunisia that also involve a U.N. envoy , many doubt Gaddafi and his sons would cede power even with a guarantee of immunity from international prosecution . 
Even his death might not end his family 's influence . 
`` Gaddafi will have plenty of tricks up his sleeves until his very last breath , '' said Hayat Alvi , lecturer in Middle Eastern politics at the U.S. Naval War College . 
`` He will have instructed his sons and circle of loyalists -- especially those remaining in the security services -- to plant as many obstacles in the rebels ' and transitional government 's paths as possible , even in his absence . '' 
The rebels and NATO may hope an uprising or coup in Tripoli would let them enter the city without the kind of street battle that would challenge the skills of both rebels and Western air forces . 
But not everyone believes such an outcome is likely . 
`` Unrest in Tripoli remains limited to small scale bouts of localized unrest and shortages during Ramadan caused by the opposition 's militias could fuel resentment against them rather than the regime , '' said Henry Smith , Libya analyst for risk consultancy Control Risks . 
Having initially hoped a flurry of NATO air strikes would be enough to oust Gaddafi , the mood in many Western capitals darkened the point of outright pessimism as the war dragged on . 
Recent rebel military success might make it easier for NATO states to extend their military campaign when they next meet on August 31 , but longer term worries are already building . 
The killing last month of Abdel Fattah Younes , military chief for the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , by rival rebels further strengthened views of Gaddafi 's opponents in the east as divided among themselves . 
Rebels in the west -- who have made most of the recent military gains -- have also openly voiced dissatisfaction with the lack of progress made by the Benghazi-based eastern bloc . 
Oil firms in particular worry that even a relatively easy end to the war could simply set the stage for more chaos . 
At worst , they fear a collapse into a new and more complex civil war . 
At the very least , bureaucratic and political infighting could make a return to prewar business impossible . 
`` The place will not necessarily become more peaceful if Gaddafi goes , '' said one Western risk consultant advising several major firms on Libya investments . 
`` You will have ex-Gaddafi people , the NTC and expats from the trading families returning , '' he said . 
`` And they will be at each other 's throats . '' 
A July report from oil specialists Wood Mackenzie estimated that even after a possible overthrow of Gaddafi it could take around 36 months for Libya to resume full oil production of 1.6 million barrels per day , roughly 2 percent of global output . 
Even with the swift lifting of international sanctions , many oil firms look likely to hang back from sending in teams to restart old projects or from investigating new ones . 
`` Even if Gaddafi does go it will be far from a smooth transition , '' said one oil executive and security specialist . 
`` Remove a dictator and destroy his security apparatus and you are left with a scenario remarkably like Iraq , and look how long that has taken . '' 
Saddam Hussein was overthrown more than eight years ago , but the country remains very troubled . 
Western governments too also seem reluctant to plunge deeper into greater involvement in a post-Gaddafi Libya . 
Sources with knowledge of post-war planning say some has taken place , but it is largely limited to a relatively few civilian officials . 
With Western powers exhausted by Iraq and Afghanistan and now dealing with economic crisis and perhaps even a rising risk of civil unrest at home , few believe they have the appetite for large peacekeeping missions that could last years . 
While Libya does not have the same Sunni-Shi ` ite sectarian division that rendered post-Saddam Iraq such a tinderbox , it does have complex tribal divisions that could fuel conflict . 
Some suspect that even after a Gaddafi departure it could remain effectively somewhat divided into east and west along ancient provincial boundaries . 
But physical conflict and further damage to oil facilities is not the only worry for oil firms who spent years courting Gaddafi to gain access to the country . 
In the potentially febrile atmosphere of postwar Libya , they fear massive renegotiation of contracts and the digging up of old secrets . 
`` The biggest threat to oil firms is that the new regime will inevitably try to investigate who paid what to secure contracts with Gaddafi , '' said the anonymous political risk consultant . 
`` The firms will either have to pay again or face the risk of information being disclosed publicly and potentially ending up in courts in Europe and the U.S. '' -LRB- Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov ; editing by Alastair Macdonald -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Love or hate Gaddafi , there is no doubting he has majority backing from tribes . 
Regardless of how people feel , the real cost of this war is yet to come . 
Because without security , no foreign contractor -LRB- oil or otherwise -RRB- can return a profit from Libya ventures . 
So what 's the plan ? 
There really is n't one , is there ? 
Gaddafi has never been anything than a mad tyrant . 
He oppressed the berber tribes ; banned them to speak their own language , having their old culture . 
He sponsored terrorism inside and outside of Libya . 
Killings , rapes , corruption , unemployment , suffering . 
He killed hundreds of innocent people blowing 3 airplanes . 
He tortured his own people , he stolen money from Libya . 
There is nothing good about Gaddafi . 
Only someone with absolutely no knowledge whatsoever of Libya would say he has been a good person . 
Any Quaddafi actions pale in comparison to the plunder NATO nations inflicted on Africa , and the rest of the world in form of slave trade , colonization and today through neo-colonization . 
It is true that traitors existed in the past and still exist . 
They ally with invaders to sell off the sovereignty , citizens and wealth in exchange for modern ammunition and some candy . 
So to expect anything from NATO after the destruction of a country is day dreaming . 
A weak Libya is easier to plunder , this will be enabled more by the rag-tag rebels in power plus in fighting or squabbles that are sure to follow Quaddafi 's exit due to NATO\/UN bombs use to impose a puppet regime installed over Libyans with NATO bombs over the heads UN\/NATO\/Libyan opposition could have done better . 
AU and Libyan Govt so far have been the sensible parties . 
Turkey , Qatar and Arab league have betrayed Libyans by supporting the war instead of promoting peace to gain cheap favor from the west , especially European Union .

2011-08-16,"Aug 16 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - \* No secret talks with Gaddafi , says rebel council \* Report of Djerba meeting denied BENGHAZI , Libya , Aug 16 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's rebel National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- is not holding any talks with Muammar Gaddafi 's government or with the U.N. special envoy for Libya to resolve the civil war , the council 's head said on Tuesday . 
`` The NTC would like to assure that there are no negotiations either direct or indirect with the Gaddafi regime or with the special envoy of the United Nations , '' NTC leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said at a briefing where he spoke through an interpreter . 
Asked about reports of secret negotiations at the weekend on the Tunisian resort island of Djerba , Mustafa Abdel Jalil denied any back-channel communications with Gaddafi . 
`` I would like to affirm that the NTC has no knowledge and no backing of these talks ... Any political consultations or contacts should be done through or with the council , '' he said . 
The NTC has consistently denied any bid to broker a compromise deal with the Libyan leader , insisting that after 41 years in power he must simply quit and leave or be ousted by force . 
A Gaddafi government spokesman also denied negotiating with the rebel leadership . 
The U.N. special envoy trying to find a way to end the conflict in Libya , Abdel Elah al-Khatib , was scheduled to meet senior Tunisian representatives on Monday . 
A foreign ministry spokesman in Tunis on Sunday said he would also `` certainly ... meet the Libyan parties '' . 
Khatib has met on several occasions with representatives of Gaddafi and the rebels . 
His visit to the region was his first since rebel advances cut Tripoli off from its supply route to Tunisia , shifting momentum in the rebels ' favor . 
Reports of secret talks in Djerba coincided with the apparent defection of a senior figure in Gaddafi 's security apparatus , who flew from Djerba to Cairo with his family on Monday . 
At about the same time , rebel forces in the Western Mountains reported significant breakthroughs in the six-month-old conflict , taking the strategic city of Zawiyah on the coast and securing the key crossroads town of Garyan in the desert south of Tripoli . 
The advances buoyed the rebel movement and prompted analysts to speculate that the noose is tightening around Gaddafi 's stronghold in the Libyan capital and that his days in power may be numbered .

2011-08-17,"A couple arrive at Shousha camp , which was constructed by the Tunisian army to house African refugees coming from Libya , at the Ras Jdir border crossing in Tunisia , June 2 , 2011 . 
RAS JIDR , Tunisia | Wed Aug 17 , 2011 2:57 am EDT RAS JIDR , Tunisia -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Five months after Sudanese worker Mohammed Hassan fled civil war in Libya he is still stranded in a tent city just across the border in Tunisia . 
`` In my own country there is a conflict and violence . 
I can not go there so where do I go now ? '' 
said Mohammed , who comes from Sudan 's troubled Darfur region . 
He left years ago for Libya to escape violence at home . 
The United Nations says almost 900,000 people , including 200,000 foreign workers , have fled Libya into Tunisia to escape fighting after rebels launched an uprising against the 41-year-rule of Muammar Gaddafi in February . 
African workers in particular were frequently targeted by Gaddafi 's opponents , who sometimes accused them of working for the government as mercenaries . 
Most of the Libyans have gone back home or have found new places to stay , and most of the foreigners have been sent home to their countries of origin . 
But around 4,000 of the foreigners , like Mohammed , can not go home because of war or danger in their own countries , and have remained for months in this camp near the border , stateless and unsure of their future . 
In March , Mohammed made his way to Ras Jidr , the main gateway between Libya and Tunisia . 
He has been staying in a tent city just behind the border post . 
`` I came with my family to Libya because life in Darfur was bad . 
It 's still bad there . 
There is no stability , '' he said , sitting on a mat with fellow Sudanese refugees . 
More than two million people have left their homes in Darfur after the government started a campaign against non-Arab rebels there . 
Fighting has ebbed from peak levels but there is no end to the conflict in the region , which borders eastern Libya . 
With the help of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR , Mohammed has filed a request for asylum . 
So far few Western countries have signalled a willingness to accept stranded Africans from the border camps , U.N. officials say . 
`` We are conducting interviews on an individual case basis and trying to speed up the process but it takes time , '' said Rocco Nuri , a spokesman for UNHCR in Tunisia . 
Many others in the camp share the same fate , sitting in front of their white tents or under trees by the main road to the border . 
`` I came to Benghazi to study but I do n't know what to do now , '' said another young Sudanese man from South Kordofan , a region which has seen fighting recently between the army and fighters allied to newly-independent South Sudan . 
The early days of the conflict in Libya saw chaos at the border and a massive effort to prevent humanitarian disaster . 
The camps in Tunisia were overcrowded at the start , with fights breaking out between refugees waiting for hours for food or water . 
Tensions ran high between refugees from areas at conflict with each other , such as Sudanese from Darfur and the capital Khartoum . 
Some governments such as Egypt sent planes to fetch their stranded citizens . 
Half a million Libyans returned home , according to the UNHCR . 
The rest have largely scattered . 
The 4,000 Africans who remain , segregated by nationalities , live in tents exposed to the sun in the open plain . 
`` The location is unfortunate because it is close to the border and very hot , '' said Nuri . 
Most have applied for asylum in Western countries . 
Some have no money to go home or no plan of where to go . 
`` I came to Libya in 1990 to work first as a factory worker and have done several other jobs since then , '' said Omar from Ivory Coast . 
`` I do n't know what to do now , '' he said , before heading to his tent . 
While he enjoyed living and making good money in Libya , he said going back to Libya is not an option . 
`` It got impossible to stay in Libya , not just because of the security but the attacks against black people , '' he said . 
Abdulrahman , also from Darfur , said he had been accused by both Gaddafi supporters and rebels of fighting for the other side . 
`` We 're in the middle of accusations from both sides . ''

2011-08-17,"ISTANBUL | Wed Aug 17 , 2011 11:44 am EDT ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey 's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan likened the situation in neighboring Syria to Libya on Wednesday , keeping up the pressure on Damascus to end a violent crackdown on protests demanding the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad . 
Turkish leaders , who once backed Assad , are sounding increasingly frustrated with the Syrian leader in the same way they became frustrated with Muammar Gaddafi after trying to mediate in the Libyan civil war . 
`` We have done our best on Libya , but have n't been able to generate any results . 
So it 's an international issue now . 
Gaddafi could not meet our expectations , and the outcome was obvious , '' Erdogan told reporters . 
`` Now the same situation is going on in Syria . 
I 've sent my foreign minister , and personally got in touch many times , the last of them three days ago on the phone . 
In spite of all this , civilians are still getting killed , '' he said . 
Erdogan repeatedly contacted Gaddafi after the Libyan uprising began in February , calling for a ceasefire and for Gaddafi to allow a transition of power . 
In June , Erdogan offered him an unspecified guarantee if he left Libya but received no answer . 
Since then Turkey has stepped up support for the Libyan rebels , increasing shipments of diesel to them . 
Syrian troops raided houses in a Sunni district of the besieged port of Latakia on Wednesday , residents said , arresting hundreds of people and taking them to a stadium after a four-day tank assault to crush protests against Assad . 
Rights organizations say at least 1,700 civilians have been killed by security forces since the protests erupted in March , while Syrian authorities say terrorist groups have killed 500 soldiers and police . 
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu also called again on Wednesday for Syria to end military operations but he has ruled out foreign intervention in Turkey 's southern neighbor . 
`` The bloodshed has to stop , first and foremost . 
The military operations have to stop , '' Davutoglu told a news conference with his Jordanian counterpart Nasser Judeh . 
`` If the operations continue in Syria and the operations become a regional problem Turkey can naturally not remain indifferent . '' 
Asked about a news report that Turkey might create a buffer zone along its border with Syria , Davutoglu said : `` We 're talking about a border that is 900 km long . 
We can not talk about such a development right now , '' he said . 
Turkish officials denied on Tuesday the report that Ankara was planning a buffer zone to prevent an influx of refugees . 
With Assad defying international pressure and Syrian refugees crossing over the border into Turkey , media have previously said that Turkish political and military leaders were considering setting up a buffer zone inside Syria . 
Relations between Syria and Turkey , its imperial ruler until World War One , have often been tense . 
The two countries almost went to war in the 1990s when Turkish forces were battling Kurdish rebels operating from bases inside Syria .

2011-08-18,"NATO says rebel forces are taking control of the territory around Tripoli Experts caution that both rebels and pro-Gadhafi forces have claimed big advances before Gadhafi is under huge international pressure to step down as leader The North African country has been riven by conflict for the past five months -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The conflict in Libya has at times seemed as much a war of words as a war on the ground , with both the Gadhafi government and the rebel forces claiming to hold the upper hand . 
But could reports of significant rebel advances in recent days signal a decisive shift in momentum to their side , after months of apparent stalemate ? 
Col. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for NATO 's military operation , told reporters Tuesday that `` anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli , '' the Gadhafi-held capital which has long eluded the rebels ' grasp . 
Describing the advances as `` the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months , '' he painted a picture of Gadhafi 's forces on the back foot , losing `` considerable grounds '' on several fronts , as the rebels advance into the west . 
NATO deputy spokeswoman Carmen Romero also spoke of the use by government forces of an unguided short-range ballistic missile in a civilian area as a sign that `` Gadhafi and his regime are desperate . '' 
And an impassioned audio address by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi earlier this week in which he called on his people to `` be ready to fight to liberate our pure and good land '' could suggest he is under mounting pressure . 
The rebels themselves say they are now poised to seize the key town of al-Zawiya , which lies on a strategic supply route about 30 miles -LRB- 50 kilometers -RRB- to the west of Tripoli , and then to advance on the capital within days . 
Supporters outside the North African country are similarly optimistic . 
Dr. Mahmoud Traina , a 31-year-old Libyan-American cardiologist in southern California , called the rebel push into Zawiya in recent days `` a turning point , '' since Gadhafi had fought hard to maintain control of the coastal city . 
`` It shows the weakening of his regime , '' Traina , who was born in the Untied States but has family in Tripoli and Misrata , told CNN in a telephone interview . 
`` It cuts off his supply routes for his last remaining supply of fuel , and cuts supply lines for all products from Tunisia . '' 
He added : `` I think this is the end-game move before he 's out of power . 
At this point , it 's only a matter of time . '' 
But whether such hopes are well-founded is up for debate . 
Representatives of the Gadhafi government still maintain that it is doing well -- and analysts differ over what might happen next . 
Professor Malcolm Chalmers , a UK defense policy expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London , believes the military momentum is now with the rebels , after a period in which they made no advances . 
`` This has always been a war of attrition by NATO , based on the view that over time the capabilities of the regime would continue to diminish and at some stage -- especially since Gadhafi 's forces were having to fight on several fronts at once -- would start to crumble , '' he said . 
`` And indeed , that seems to be what 's happening . '' 
The progressive degrading of Gadhafi 's military capabilities by NATO strikes has levelled the playing field for the rebels , he said , who are also now benefiting from more access to funds . 
`` It 's become more and more difficult for -LRB- Gadhafi 's forces -RRB- to retake ground that they lose because their offensive weaponry is being destroyed , and their command and control ability is being destroyed , '' he said . 
If rebel gains mean the regime forces also lose their re-supply routes from Tunisia , as seems likely , `` that is going to accelerate the decline in military capability , '' Chalmers said , adding that he does not see them lasting `` more than one or two months , maybe less . '' 
However , Simon Henderson , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , told CNN it was still too early to say whether the end-game was in sight . 
`` There has been so much to-ing and fro-ing in terms of advance and retreat by both sides , it 's hard to make the judgment at the moment that the opposition has made significant and permanent gains , '' he said . 
`` It 's still too early to say that the end of this is going to be a complete defeat of Gadhafi 's forces , '' he said , pointing to the fact that despite months of fighting the rebels have not managed to take Tripoli . 
`` It still seems as though Gadhafi is a long way from being pushed out , '' he said . 
Senior U.S. officials also caution that the rebels made real advances in the first months of the campaign , only to lose them and for the situation to remain stagnant for a while . 
The officials , who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity , say the current advances are `` significant , '' but that it remains to be seen how long Gadhafi can hang on and what supplies he still has . 
They say the end for Gadhafi 's regime could be tomorrow , or could still be a long way off . 
Nobody really wants to predict when it might come , they say -- but it wo n't be until people in Tripoli sense the end is near and rise up . 
Observers note that NATO action has been key to almost every significant gain the rebels have made so far in the five-month-old war -- and some question whether NATO is going beyond its mission of protecting the civilian population if it continues to target Gadhafi 's forces when they are on the defensive . 
Lavoie disputed that Tuesday , saying that the only side NATO took was `` the side of the people of Libya '' and that any targets hit were those that represented `` a threat to the local population . '' 
Although NATO says the rebels effectively control the territory around Tripoli , it is still by no means certain they can take the capital , a Gadhafi stronghold . 
After 42 years in power , the Libyan leader still commands the loyalty of many people and the city regularly witnesses large pro-Gadhafi rallies . 
While the rebels have now held towns along the way to Zawiya for the past few days , they have not so far been able completely to take control of Zawiya itself . 
And residents fleeing Tripoli told CNN they believed that if the rebels can not coordinate an attack from several fronts they will struggle to succeed , as almost all roads in and out of the capital are shut or heavily monitored by government forces . 
Nonetheless , Col. Ahmed Banni , military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council , said Tuesday that rebels hope to enter the capital by the end of the month . 
Rebel commander Col. Radwan Heid struck a similar note of optimism . 
`` These are the last days , God willing , '' he told CNN , referring to Gadhafi 's grip on the capital and the country as a whole . 
Morale among rebel troops in and around the western Nafusa mountains -- where NATO says local people feel safe enough from attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces to start to return -- also seems high , observers say . 
But a spokesman for Gadhafi , Ibrahim Musa , offered a different view this week . 
He said the government was `` doing very well '' despite problems with `` armed gangs '' in the coastal towns of Surman and Sabratha , which NATO said rebel forces had reached . 
`` God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully . 
We will achieve peace and victory , '' Musa said . 
At a news conference Thursday , Libyan Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoodi said that the military is `` powerful enough to finish this battle '' to its advantage , but warned that the cost would be too high , calling again for dialogue to resolve the crisis peacefully rather than militarily . 
Al-Mahmoodi said the government 's call for a peaceful resolution comes from `` a position of power , not weakness ... we are able to continue the fight , but from the very beginning we chose peace . '' 
The government was currently in talks with all parties , he added . 
If the rebels ' military advances outstrip such diplomatic efforts , what might lie ahead for Libya ? 
Chalmers said that may hinge on whether people within the Gadhafi regime decide the game is up . 
`` One very plausible scenario for the next stage is that there will be people within the regime other than the Gadhafi family who seek to negotiate a cease-fire and a political settlement which involves the Gadhafi family leaving in some shape or form , but does n't involve a rebel military advance into Tripoli , '' he said . 
However , political divisions within the rebel ranks make it hard to be confident that they can form a credible national government even if they do achieve a military victory over Gadhafi 's government , Chalmers added . 
The big worry over the next month , he said , is that the regime simply collapses , leaving the country to fall into a mess of tribal rivalries and reprisals against government supporters , with Islamist groups also getting involved . 
`` It now looks as if the days of the Gadhafi regime itself are numbered , but who knows who will replace it ? '' 
Henderson agrees that the rebel forces `` still fail to impress . '' 
Their credibility was not improved by the murky killing last month of Gen. Abdul Fattah Younis in Benghazi , the city where the rebels ' Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- is based , he said . 
`` They are far from being a united front and after the death of Younis they are short of professional leadership , '' Henderson said . 
Saad Djebbar , an international lawyer who negotiated the release in Scotland two years ago of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi , the man convicted of blowing up a Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie , believes it is vital to establish what he called a `` coalition of cultures '' which represents all regions , tribes and factions to ensure a stable Libya post-Gadhafi . 
He called on the international community to facilitate that coalition because `` Libyans do n't have the expertise to do it '' -- and told CNN Gadhafi is `` losing power by the minute . '' 
Omar Turbi , the Libyan-born president of a computer company who moved to the United States aged 18 and now lives in Laguna Beach , California , agrees that Gadhafi 's grip on power is weakening . 
The proximity of rebel forces to Gadhafi 's power base in Tripoli `` is a clear indication that he does n't have any fighting or any kind of power to fight , '' he said . 
Turbi , who says he works closely with the TNC in an unofficial capacity , said it planned efforts to prevent looting and reprisals once the Gadhafi regime falls . 
He speculated that the Gadhafi government would last no more than 30 days . 
`` We have a pretty strong feeling that something is up , '' he said . 
Maybe in a few days , things will start to crumble . '' 
Looking ahead , he said he hoped that any new government would incorporate all elements of Libyan society except for those with blood on their hands . 
`` Everyone in Libya should be welcomed back to take part in building the country or keeping the country together . '' 
Mansour El-Kikhia , 59 , a Libyan scholar and dissident , also predicted Gadhafi 's downfall within days . 
`` He 's going , he 's going down , '' he said . 
`` It 's just a matter of time , that 's all . 
I bet you , maybe 15 more days . '' 
Born in Benghazi , he left in 1977 to study in the United States and is now an associate professor and chairman of the Department of Political Science and Geography at the University of Texas , San Antonio . 
Recently , he visited relatives in Libya he had not seen in three decades . 
El-Kikhia predicted that Gadhafi will make any departure a messy one by firing missiles into oil fields in the rebel-held eastern reaches of the country and setting them afire . 
And he warned that with the main supply route for Gadhafi 's forces now closed , the humanitarian situation could rapidly worsen . 
Already , people in Tripoli are having problems , as shops are having difficulty getting goods and foodstuffs . 
`` It 's turning into being a disaster , '' he said . 
`` This really means that the rebels have to move fast . ''

2011-08-18,"Fighting in Libya started with anti-government demonstrations in February and escalated into a nationwide civil war . 
For months , rebel fighters -- who have controlled the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer toward Tripoli , in the west . 
They are seeking the ouster of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for 42 years . 
International leaders have accused Gadhafi 's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians . 
Libyan officials have repeatedly accused NATO of killing civilians in airstrikes . 
Here are some key points CNN has reported in the conflict . 
Three days after the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , calls go out on Facebook for peaceful demonstrations in Libya against leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
The Libyan leader , who has ruled over the country for more than four decades , voiced support for Mubarak during the Egyptian crisis . 
About 200 demonstrators protesting the arrest of a human activist take to the streets in the coastal city of Benghazi , witnesses say . 
Several of them are arrested amid confrontations with police . 
A highly placed source close to the Libyan government tells CNN , `` There is nothing serious here . 
These are just young people fighting each other . '' 
Libyan state television shows images of men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans , waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader 's limousine as it creeps through Tripoli . 
In Benghazi , human rights groups and protesters claim they 're under attack by pro-government security forces . 
Among the tens of thousands of protesters who take to the streets , at least 20 people are killed and 200 are wounded , according to medical sources . 
Protests continue to turn violent , however the death and injury toll is unclear . 
In Benghazi , witnesses report bloody clashes with soldiers firing tear gas and bullets . 
Witnesses say protests have erupted in cities across the country . 
Human Rights Watch reports that 84 people have been killed in Libyan demonstrations since February 15 . 
Violence surges in Benghazi where a witness says protesters have taken control of the city and much of Tripoli . 
Gadhafi 's son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi appears on state television to warn demonstrators that the country could fall into civil war if their protests do not subside . 
The Libyan newspaper Quryna reports that the country 's justice minister has resigned to protest what he calls a `` bloody situation and use of excessive force '' by security forces against protesters .

2011-08-18,"In hospital in Yefren , a 9-year-old girl may lose her arm White House OKs two more drones for Libya Most of Zawiya is in `` rebel hands , '' commander says Snipers , shelling are in the east of the city Zawiya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rebel fighters in Libya , trying to take over a key western city , faced stiff resistance from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces on Wednesday , a rebel commander said . 
The fighters hope to seize Zawiya , about 30 miles west of the capital , in an effort to advance on the capital of Tripoli in their fight to topple the Gadhafi regime that has controlled the North African country for decades . 
`` Most of Zawiya is now in rebel hands , but there are snipers and shelling coming from the east of the city , '' rebel commander Col. Radwan Fheid said . 
`` The snipers are near Zawiya hospital . 
They ca n't stay because of the shelling . 
These are the last days , God willing . '' 
Rebels are setting up checkpoints and field hospitals to treat the wounded , many of whom have been shot or struck by shrapnel . 
At a hospital in nearby Yefren , doctors said they had treated more than 200 patients over the past four days -- some of them rebel soldiers from any of several front lines , some of them civilians . 
Among the latter was a 9-year-old girl who was in her house when it was hit by a missile , sending shrapnel into her , a doctor said . 
`` Unfortunately , there is more than 90 % chance that she may lose her right arm here , '' he said . 
Medical staff said they were donating their own blood to keep their patients alive . 
One man , both legs wrapped in bandages , cried out in pain . 
Doctors said there were not enough staff members to properly take care of the patient load . 
Zawiya is west of Tripoli on a strategic supply route . 
Rebel control of Zawiya would represent a major advance toward putting a stranglehold on the Gadhafi-controlled seat of power . 
Col. Ahmed Banni , military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council , said Tuesday that rebels hope to enter the capital by the end of the month . 
The Obama administration has agreed to a NATO request for two additional Predator drones to conduct operations over Libya , a U.S. defense official said Wednesday , a day after the drones began flying . 
The United States has earmarked up to six drones for the Libya operation in recent months , although until generally only two drones have flown at any one time ; some have been armed with missiles . 
In Washington , the Libyan Embassy was officially re-opened Wednesday by its ambassador amid a crowd of proud Libyan Americans waving flags and singing Libyan songs . 
`` This embassy will serve as a symbol of the new Libya here in the U.S. , '' Ambassador Ali Aujali said outside the Watergate building in Washington where the embassy is located . 
`` We will work tirelessly not only to serve the needs of the Libyans studying , living and traveling in this country , but also to thank the United States government on behalf of the Libyan people everywhere for its continuing support for transition to a free and democratic nation . '' 
The mission now represents the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- , the rebel movement based in Benghazi , that the United States recognized as the rightful government of Libya on July 15 . 
The embassy was closed in March after the State Department expelled all diplomats loyal to Gadhafi . 
Aujali , who previously represented the Gadhafi regime in Washington , resigned his post in February , and has since represented the TNC in Washington . 
He was formally accredited as head of the Libyan mission last week . 
On Tuesday , Col. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for NATO 's military operation , said that `` anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli . '' 
He described the advances as `` the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months . '' 
Since the end of July , as the threat from pro-Gadhafi forces has diminished , thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western Nafusa mountains , he said . 
Since Friday , the northwest coastal city of Misrata has been free of pro-Gadhafi forces , he said . 
And the threat from nearby Zlitan has diminished as pro-Gadhafi forces are being pushed farther west , he added . 
Lavoie said rebels had occupied Surman and Sabratha west of Tripoli but added that the regions were `` still contested . '' 
However , Libyan state television reported that pro-Gadhafi forces and tribal fighters were `` cleansing the city of Sabratha from the gangs of traitors '' and had secured the coastal road , a key supply pipeline into Tripoli . 
Though the center of Zawiya was under rebel control , `` there 's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs , '' Lavoie said . 
A spokesman for the Gadhafi government offered a different view on Tuesday . 
`` We are doing very well , '' Ibrahim Musa said . 
`` It 's true that it 's a bit slow ; people are still saying that we 're not acting immediately and that we 're having problems in Surman and Sabratha and whatnot because of armed gangs . 
That 's true , but , God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully . 
We will achieve peace and victory . '' 
He added , `` We are fighting NATO , not the tens or hundreds of armed gang members . 
Our war is with the crusaders . ''

Full Article Libya rebels battle for refineries in east and west ZAWIYAH , Libya | Thu Aug 18 , 2011 3:52 am IST ZAWIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels to the west and east of Libya 's increasingly isolated capital fought forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi on Wednesday for control of oil facilities vital to winning the six-month-old civil war . 
In Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , they assaulted a coastal oil refinery to try to drive the last Gaddafi forces out and tighten their noose around the capital . 
A rebel spokesman said a pipeline to Tripoli was cut . 
There was no word on the outcome of their assault after nightfall . 
In Brega , on the eastern front , rebel forces said they had suffered 18 killed and 33 wounded on Tuesday and Wednesday in their battle to dislodge Gaddafi forces from the oil port and refinery , where they have been fighting for many days . 
Fifteen of the rebels were killed on Tuesday and three on Wednesday , said spokesman Mohammad Zawawi . 
Libyan state television showed video of Gaddafi supporters at the Brega terminal on Wednesday chanting the leader 's name . 
After 41 years of supreme power , 69-year-old Gaddafi seems isolated . 
Rebel forces are closing in from the west , south and east , cutting off his Tripoli stronghold on the Mediterranean shore . 
Gaddafi 's whereabouts are not known . 
Aided by NATO 's fighter-bombers , assault helicopters and naval blockade , the rebels have transformed the battle in the last few days after many weeks of stalemate . 
Zawiyah controls the western highway linking Tripoli to Tunisia . 
Gaddafi forces were holding the refinery there and harassing rebels in the city with shelling and sniper fire . 
`` There are some snipers inside the refinery facility . 
We control the gates of the refinery . 
We will be launching an operation to try to take control of it shortly , '' a rebel fighter , Abdulkarim Kashaba , said earlier on Wednesday . 
A rebel spokesman from the opposition-held city of Misrata to the east of Tripoli said rebels had found the buried bodies of civilians they said had been slaughtered by Gaddafi forces . 
`` We discovered a mass grave containing 150 bodies in Tawargha . 
These are the corpses of civilians kidnapped from Misrata by Gaddafi 's loyalists , '' he said . 
Rebels found a video `` showing kidnappers cutting the throats of people '' , he said . 
The spokesman said rebel forces were now outside a place called Hisha about 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- west of Misrata on the road to Tripoli . 
`` They are now on the coastal road , '' he said . 
Zawiyah 's refinery is one of the few sources of fuel for Gaddafi 's troops and the people of Tripoli . 
A rebel commander said the pipeline linking it to Tripoli was severed on Tuesday . 
Gaddafi 's green flags were still flying from a refinery building and an electrical pylon in Zawiyah . 
The rest of the city now flies the red , black and green flag of the rebels . 
Streets were largely deserted apart from clusters of fighters . 
Medical workers said three people were killed and 35 wounded on Tuesday , mostly civilians . 
If the pipeline to Tripoli is indeed cut , `` that would imply dire consequences for the population in Tripoli in terms of fuel supplies needed for the city to keep operating '' , said Fernando Calado of the International Organisation for Migration . 
Calado said there had been a sharp increase in the past week in the number of foreign nationals asking to be evacuated . 
He estimated that more than 300,000 foreigners remain in Tripoli , including many from the Philippines and Sri Lanka , as well as Libya 's neighbors Chad , Egypt and Tunisia . 
`` We have received 2,000 requests at this point . 
The potential caseload is huge . 
We 're exploring the possibility of land , sea and air evacuations , '' he told Reuters . 
Libya 's rebel National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- denies holding secret talks with Gaddafi to end the war . 
But suspicions persist that some form of end-game negotiation may be going on . 
The NTC , however , insists Gaddafi step down and leave Libya , saying talks ignoring this basic demand would be `` unthinkable '' .

2011-08-19,"What began as a supposedly neutral intervention has become one-sided , analyst says NATO has continued to insist that its aim is to protect civilians from Gadhafi forces There appears to be growing coordination between NATO and rebel commanders France , Qatar interpret arms embargo more liberally than some parties -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six months and more than 17,000 air sorties after it began , NATO 's Operation Unified Protector in the skies over Libya grinds on . 
What was envisaged in March as a rapid engagement to prevent Moammar Gadhafi 's forces from razing Benghazi to the ground has evolved into a long slog . 
And increasingly NATO operations have dovetailed with those of the rebels -- with the aim of making pro-Gadhafi forces incapable of offensive action . 
The initial mandate set out by the United Nations Security Council resolution 1973 was to protect civilians under threat or attack , to enforce an arms embargo on the country and implement a no-fly zone . 
`` What was initially supposed to be a neutral intervention to protect civilians that were threatened specifically in Benghazi has morphed into being largely a one-sided affair to support the Libyan rebel force to overthrow Gadhafi , '' says Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations . 
Throughout the conflict NATO has continued to insist that all its actions are aimed at protecting civilians from pro-Gadhafi forces , and that it has not `` taken sides . '' 
On Thursday , the Royal Air Force spoke of `` precision strikes on former regime facilities at Sabratah -LRB- west of Tripoli -RRB- , including a commando base which had been used by Colonel Gadhafi 's men to launch numerous reprisals against the local people . '' 
But such missions are invariably close to areas where the rebels are trying to break through . 
In recent weeks , sustained NATO strikes around Brega , Misrata and in the western Nafusa mountains have helped tip the military balance in the rebels ' favor , to the point that Gadhafi 's opponents have become reluctant to enter the fray until air power has softened up the enemy . 
Derek Flood , a journalist and analyst with the Jamestown Foundation , has just spent several weeks in western Libya . 
`` I found the rebels had become almost overly dependent on NATO to the point they would n't act without NATO actually softening up the targets first . '' 
Rebels gaining ground in Tripoli Libyan rebels claim critical victory Video : Libyan rebels free prisoners Most recently , rebel efforts to take the vitally important town of Zawiyah , just 30 miles west of Tripoli , were preceded by several days of NATO sorties . 
NATO lists about a dozen `` key hits '' around Zawiyah in the past five days . 
The Royal Air Force also targeted a boat commandeered by several Libyan soldiers to get out of Zawiyah , but a statement said that `` since it was clear from their actions that these troops continued to pose a threat to the local population , the RAF patrol engaged the ship , '' which was destroyed . 
There appears to be growing coordination between NATO and rebel military commanders . 
Video footage emerged at the beginning of this month of a column of rebel tanks and pickup trucks , outside the city of Brega in eastern Libya , daubed with orange paint to distinguish them from government forces and ensure they were n't erroneously bombed . 
In previous days , NATO planes had hit several pro-regime targets around Brega . 
On a fluid battlefield , where military assets are poorly marked and often hidden in civilian areas , NATO needs forward air controllers to help with targeting . 
`` Western air forces do n't bomb without that direct ability to visualize the battlefield , especially when the regime has placed so many of its assets within civilian protected areas , '' Zenko says . 
NATO spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie was pressed on the issue at a news briefing last month . 
`` NATO does not have direct coordination with opposition forces or rebel forces in Brega , '' he said . 
But he added : `` We follow the situation through allied information sources that are in the area . '' 
NATO wo n't comment on such arrangements . 
The arms embargo has been liberally interpreted by some , with Qatar and France supplying the rebels with weapons and military advice . 
Qatar is reported to have supplied the rebels with antitank missiles , flying them into Benghazi . 
And Derek Flood said he believes Qatar was also getting weapons to the rebels via the Tunisian border . 
In the western mountains `` there was support on the ground from Qatari officials as well as Emirati officials , '' he said . 
Tunisian officials deny weapons are crossing their border . 
Neither Qatar nor the United Arab Emirates have commented on such involvement . 
France acknowledged in June that it had air-dropped assault rifles and ammunition to Berber militia groups in the western mountains but said they were to help civilians protect themselves . 
At sea , NATO has operated a blockade -- in accordance with U.N. resolutions -- to prevent any resupply of Gadhafi forces . 
But in one instance in May a Canadian frigate stopped a rebel tugboat carrying howitzer rounds , ammunition and `` lots of explosives '' from Benghazi to Misrata . 
NATO commanders allowed the vessel to proceed on the grounds that it was moving from one Libyan port to another . 
More recently , there was the murky case of the oil tanker Cartagena , a vessel owned by the Libyan government but stranded at sea with 30,000 tons of gasoline since May . 
Rebels boarded the ship in international waters and diverted it to Benghazi with NATO permission . 
The unknown : Did the rebels have help in seizing the ship ? 
It 's not the sort of operation they are used to . 
NATO 's mission has shifted in another way . 
After hitting more than 3,000 military targets -- from ammunition dumps to tanks to radar and command-and-control facilities -- there are not many more left . 
So it has turned to the regime 's infrastructure . 
The satellite dishes of Libyan state TV were bombed on the grounds that the broadcaster was being used to `` incite violence . '' 
The radar at Tripoli airport also was taken out , and the sprawling Gadhafi compound in Tripoli has been targeted several times . 
NATO officials say operations will continue for as long as it takes , though how long it takes to do what is an open question . 
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said repeatedly that the conflict can only end with a political solution , but the outlines of such a solution are far from clear . 
Zenko says the goal from early on has been regime change , and the latest tactic is to try to cut off all economic and outside supplies to make it cease functioning . 
While the Libyan regime has lost access to much of the country and is losing critical routes to the east , west and south , Derek Flood says it appears to retain control of border crossings in the Sahara desert -- from Algeria , Chad and Niger . 
The military balance has tipped in the rebels ' favor . 
Flood says the capture by rebels of the important road junction at Gharyan 80 kilometers south of Tripoli can only further isolate the regime , cutting off fuel supplies from Algeria . 
Even so , it still controls large tracts of a vast country . 
NATO 's current mandate in Libya expires at the end of September . 
Its members may yet be asked to extend it once again .

2011-08-20,"By the CNN Wire Staff Fighting fierce 40 miles from Tripoli NEW : A Libyan official says neither Gadhafi , his wife or children are leaving NEW : U.S. and NATO officials say they have no indication Gadhafi is leaving Former Libyan prime minister joins opposition forces , rebels say Gadhafi could be planning a final offensive against civilians , one official says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan officials are rejecting rebel claims that Moammar Gadhafi is seeking refuge for his family , saying Friday that neither the leader nor his wife and children plan to leave the country . 
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told CNN that Gadhafi and his family are staying in the country , countering rebel reports that the governments of Egypt , Morocco , Tunisia and Algeria have been asked to accept the family . 
U.S. and NATO officials also say they have no indication Gadhafi is making preparations to leave . 
Abdel Monem al-Houni , a representative of the rebel Transitional Council in Cairo , told CNN he was informed about the request by the Arab governments who received it . 
Rebels capture Zawiya oil refinery Kaim said the four governments could speak on their own behalf about the rebel claims . 
The reports come as U.S. officials say the embattled leader may be making preparations for a last stand in Tripoli as a months-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances . 
`` We believe he could be planning for a last stand , '' one U.S. official said . 
A second U.S. official confirmed a similar concern and said the Gadhafi plan could involve a final military offensive against civilians , launched from his last major strongholds around the Libyan capital . 
The officials , who have knowledge of the situation on the ground , did not want to be named because of the sensitive intelligence matters . 
In an address broadcast on Libyan state television Monday , Gadhafi urged supporters to take up arms and battle rebel forces . 
`` Move always forward to the challenge ; pick up your weapons ; go to the fight in order to liberate Libya inch by inch from the traitors and from NATO . 
Be prepared to fight if they hit the ground , '' Gadhafi said . 
Both U.S. officials emphasized that if a final push by Gadhafi happens , the United States does n't have a clear idea what form it could take . 
However , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday that U.S. officials in Benghazi have been working with the Libyan opposition `` on exactly what it 's going to look like post-Gadhafi . '' 
`` Impossible to say when he 'll go , but it 's clear that he will go , '' Toner told CNN 's Brooke Baldwin . 
Meanwhile Friday , opposition forces said a former Libyan prime minister has left Tripoli and joined with rebels in the country 's western mountains . 
Abdel Salam Jalloud `` is in Zintan and he is a free man among the rebels , '' said Jumma Ibrahim , a spokesman for the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region , a rebel group . 
Kaim declined to confirm or deny the report . 
Jalloud was among members of Gadhafi 's inner-circle responsible for the 1969 coup that put Gadhafi into power . 
Jalloud fell out of favor with the regime in the mid-1990s . 
The speculation over a Gadhafi `` last stand '' comes as his troops are battling rebel forces on a number of fronts , including in the west , where fighting has raged for days over the strategic city of Zawiya , about 30 miles west of Tripoli and a major supply route to the capital . 
Fierce artillery fire could be heard around Zawiya on Friday . 
Rebels took a major oil refinery there , said Hobab Jomaa , a rebel fighter . 
They were in control of the western part of the city , but battles continued in the eastern part , he said . 
When asked when rebels might begin their move toward Tripoli , one fighter in Zawiya told CNN 's Sara Sidner , `` Two days , maybe by the end of the week . '' 
`` They are becoming more emboldened , '' Sidner said of the rebels . 
`` They feel like they can really have a chance at Tripoli . '' 
The International Organization for Migration said Friday that it is working to evacuate an unknown number of foreign nationals from Tripoli and other western cities `` who are increasingly vulnerable and now want to leave . '' 
Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim downplayed the movements Friday , saying rebel supply lines have been cut off from the coast and from the south , rendering them unable to advance . 
`` We have paid a heavy price , and we have nothing in front of us except the prize , and the prize is victory over those traitors who collaborated with the crusader enemy and transformed Libya into a bloodbath , '' Ibrahim said . 
Meanwhile , a NATO airstrike destroyed the home of Abdullah al-Sanussi , the head of Libya 's intelligence service and a brother-in-law of Gadhafi 's , neighbors and Libyan government officials said Friday . 
The strike also destroyed a school and medical store , neighbors and officials said . 
One person -- not al-Sanussi -- was killed , they said . 
In June , the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for al-Sanussi along with Gadhafi and his son Saif al-Islam for actions taken as a popular uprising morphed into civil war . 
The warrants are for `` crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution committed in Libya in February `` through the state apparatus and security forces . '' 
Gadhafi 's government has rejected the court 's authority . 
The attack on al-Sanussi 's house followed a NATO airstrike Thursday night that killed a brother of Ibrahim , the government spokesman , a Libyan government official said . 
Hasan Ali Ibrahim , a younger brother of Musa Ibrahim , was working as a civilian volunteer for the Gadhafi government , the official said . 
The 25-year-old university student had left Tripoli with a group of people to check on friends in Zawiya ; he and the others were struck by bullets fired from an Apache helicopter while on foot in Zawiya 's central square , the official said .

2011-08-21,"By the CNN Wire Staff Rebels are seeking the ouster of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Fighting started with anti-government demonstrations and escalated into a civil war International leaders accuse Gadhafi 's regime of committing human rights violations Libyan officials repeatedly accuse NATO of killing civilians -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fighting in Libya started with anti-government demonstrations in February and escalated into a nationwide civil war . 
For months , rebel fighters -- who have controlled the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer toward Tripoli , in the west . 
They are seeking the ouster of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for 42 years . 
International leaders have accused Gadhafi 's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians . 
Libyan officials have repeatedly accused NATO of killing civilians in airstrikes . 
Here are some key points CNN has reported in the conflict . 
Three days after the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , calls go out on Facebook for peaceful demonstrations in Libya against leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
The Libyan leader , who has ruled over the country for more than four decades , voiced support for Mubarak during the Egyptian crisis . 
About 200 demonstrators protesting the arrest of a human activist take to the streets in the coastal city of Benghazi , witnesses say . 
Several of them are arrested amid confrontations with police . 
A highly placed source close to the Libyan government tells CNN , `` There is nothing serious here . 
These are just young people fighting each other . '' 
Libyan state television shows images of men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans , waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader 's limousine as it creeps through Tripoli . 
In Benghazi , human rights groups and protesters claim they 're under attack by pro-government security forces . 
Among the tens of thousands of protesters who take to the streets , at least 20 people are killed and 200 are wounded , according to medical sources . 
Protests continue to turn violent , however the death and injury toll is unclear . 
In Benghazi , witnesses report bloody clashes with soldiers firing tear gas and bullets . 
Witnesses say protests have erupted in cities across the country . 
Human Rights Watch reports that 84 people have been killed in Libyan demonstrations since February 15 . 
Violence surges in Benghazi where a witness says protesters have taken control of the city and much of Tripoli . 
Gadhafi 's son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi appears on state television to warn demonstrators that the country could fall into civil war if their protests do not subside . 
The Libyan newspaper Quryna reports that the country 's justice minister has resigned to protest what he calls a `` bloody situation and use of excessive force '' by security forces against protesters . 
Gadhafi appears on television to dispel rumors that he has fled the country , vowing he will never leave Libya , and `` will die as a martyr at the end . '' 
The United Nations Security Council issues a statement saying it `` condemned the violence and use of force against civilians , deplored the repression against peaceful demonstrators and expressed deep regret at the deaths of hundreds of civilians '' in Libya . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemns what he calls `` egregious violations '' of human rights as Libya tries to crush an ongoing revolt , telling reporters that those who have shed `` the blood of innocents '' must face punishment . 
U.S. President Barack Obama signs an executive order freezing Moammar Gadhafi 's assets . 
The United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions against Libya , including an arms embargo , asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and his associates . 
It also refers Gadhafi to the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity . 
The opposition movement announces that it has picked a leader : former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil . 
The European Union bans the sale of arms and ammunition to Libya and freezes the assets of Gadhafi and five members of his family , while imposing a visa ban on Gadhafi and 15 other people tied to the regime 's crackdown . 
The United Nations General Assembly adopts a resolution to oust Libya from its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council . 
NATO begins round-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya as it considers various options for dealing with escalating violence there .

Germany says it is concerned about a protracted military conflict . 
Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa says the country has decided on `` an immediate cease-fire and the stoppage of all military operations . '' 
But sources inside Libya say violence continues . 
French , British and American military forces begin the first phase of operation `` Odyssey Dawn , '' aimed at enforcing the no-fly zone . 
More than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired from American and British ships and submarines hit about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets , U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney says at a Pentagon briefing . 
The operation is meant `` to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people , '' Gortney says . 
Gadhafi , speaking on Libyan state TV , says the U.N. charter provides for Libya 's right to defend itself in a `` war zone . '' 
Weapons depots will be opened , he says . 
`` All you people of the Islamic nations and Africa , and Latin America and Asia , stand with the Libyan people in its fight against this aggression , '' Gadhafi said . 
NATO agrees to take command of the mission enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya . 
A Libyan woman with bruises all over her body bursts into a Tripoli hotel housing international journalists , shouting that she was taken from a checkpoint and held for two days while 15 of Gadhafi 's militiamen beat and raped her . 
`` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' Eman al-Obeidy says before government officials and hotel staff whisk her outside to car and drive her away . 
She is not heard from for more than a week . 
The Libyan government says al-Obeidy is mentally ill and drunk . 
Officials call her a prostitute . 
Later , the government changes its story and says the men accused of raping al-Obeidy are being investigated , but the suspects , in turn , file counter-charges for slander . 
Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa arrives in the United Kingdom and tells the government there that he has resigned . 
NATO announces that it has begun Operation Unified Protector in Libya , including an arms embargo , a no-fly zone , and `` actions to protect civilians and civilian centers . '' 
Gadhafi urges U.S. President Barack Obama to end the NATO bombing of his war-torn country , making an appeal in a letter to the American president . 
Gadhafi asks Obama to stop what he calls the `` unjust war against a small people of a developing country , '' adding that those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al Qaeda , the official said . 
In a speech , Gadhafi urges NATO to negotiate an end to airstrikes , accusing the international coalition of killing civilians and destroying the nation 's infrastructure in a bid to take over its oil production . 
NATO launches a missile attack on a house in Tripoli . 
The attack kills one of Gadhafi 's sons , Saif al-Arab Gadhafi , and several of his grandchildren . 
Al-Obeidy , who garnered worldwide attention for her vocal rape allegations against Gadhafi 's regime , says she has fled Libya , fearing for her safety . 
She tells CNN that she has crossed into Tunisia with the help of a defecting military officer and his family . 
A month later , she finds temporary sanctuary in Qatar before being deported back to Libya .

South African President Jacob Zuma lashes out at NATO , arguing that the organization is misusing the United Nations resolution meant to protect civilians `` for regime change , political assassinations and foreign military occupation . '' 
The International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi . 
The warrants are `` for crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution , `` allegedly committed across Libya '' from February 15 through `` at least '' February 28 , `` through the state apparatus and security forces , '' the court says in a news release . 
The United States and the United Kingdom join countries recognizing the Transitional National Council as `` the legitimate governing authority '' in Libya . 
After being granted asylum in the United States , al-Obeidy arrives in New York , then boards a flight to the destination where she will reside . 
Her arrival in the United States comes after she spends 54 days in a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees facility in Romania . 
Rebel leaders announce that the commander of Libya 's rebel army was assassinated in Benghazi along with two senior officers , just hours after claiming big successes on the battlefield . 
Libyan Transitional National Council Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil dismissed the rebels ' 14-member executive board , a spokesman for the council says . 
Gadhafi urges Libyans to fight opposition forces and `` cleanse this sweet and honorable land . '' 
In a speech broadcast on state television , Gadhafi says : `` The strikes will be over and NATO will be defeated . 
Move always forward to the challenge ; pick up your weapons ; go to the fight in order to liberate Libya inch by inch from the traitors and from NATO . 
Be prepared to fight if they hit the ground . '' 
Col. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for NATO 's military operation , tells reporters that `` anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli . '' 
A spokesman for the Gadhafi government offers a different view . 
`` We are doing very well , '' spokesman Musa Ibrahim says . 
Libyan Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoodi says the military is `` powerful enough to finish this battle '' to its advantage , but warned that the cost would be too high , calling again for dialogue to resolve the crisis peacefully rather than militarily . 
Meanwhile , a brother of Moussa Ibrahim , the spokesman for the government in Tripoli , was killed Thursday night by NATO aircraft , a Libyan government official said . 
U.S. officials say Gadhafi may be making preparations for a `` last stand '' in Tripoli as a month-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances . 
Libyan rebels have taken their fight inside Tripoli , home to the embattled Libyan leader , a rebel spokesman says . 
Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim insists that all is safe and well . 
He says that the Libyan capital remains under government control . 
Libyan officials reject rebel claims that Gadhafi is seeking refuge for his family , saying that neither the leader nor his wife and children plan to leave the country . 
Faithi Baja , political affairs chief for the rebels ' Transitional National Council , said in a video statement that the rebel fighters ' freshly launched operation inside Tripoli is `` going easily '' and that they are inching toward Gadhafi 's Bab al-Azizia compound . 
But Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , a son of the country 's ruler and a top official in his regime , insisted on Libyan state-run television that the rebels were losing every battle .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Hey , and thank you for joining us ! 
I 'm Carl Azuz , launching you into CNN Student News ! 
If you were with us last week , it 's great to have you back . 
If this is your first day , welcome to our 2011-2012 coverage . 
First Up : Crisis in Libya AZUZ : First up today , two very different views on how the civil war is going in the north African nation of Libya . 
This conflict started months ago . 
Longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi and his forces are fighting against rebels who want Gadhafi out . 
Other countries are involved in this , too , as part of a NATO mission to protect Libya 's civilians . 
There were reports that hundreds of people were killed yesterday during fighting in and around the Libyan capital , Tripoli . 
The rebels say they 're making significant progress , advancing toward Gadhafi 's headquarters . 
But the Libyan government says the rebels are losing every battle . 
Colonel Gadhafi went on the radio Sunday , urging his supporters to continue their fight . 
A CNN crew that 's been in Libya for weeks said this weekend 's fighting in Tripoli seemed to be the most intense fighting yet in the capital city . 
AZUZ : Violence increasing in another conflict , meanwhile , this one in the Middle East . 
It started with a series of attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers on Thursday , and it 's turned into days of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians . 
These two groups have clashed for decades . 
And two regions -- Gaza and the West Bank -- have traditionally been at the center of those clashes . 
At least eight Israelis were killed in the attacks on Thursday . 
Israel then launched air strikes against what it called `` terrorist targets '' in Gaza . 
And in response , say Israeli officials , around 100 rockets have been fired into Israel . 
You can see some of the damage from those in this video . 
Israel 's government says it will respond to any attempt to harm Israeli civilians or soldiers . 
Palestinian officials are urging Israel to stop what it calls the `` unjustified aggression '' against the Palestinians in Gaza . 
STAN CASE , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Is this legit ? 
Storms in the Atlantic Ocean are given names when they become hurricanes . 
They get names when they are classified as tropical storms , which is one level below a hurricane . 
AZUZ : The 9th storm to get a name might be the first hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic season . 
Forecasters predict that Tropical Storm Irene is picking up strength as it moves toward islands in the Caribbean Sea . 
On Sunday afternoon , Irene had wind speeds around 50 miles per hour . 
Wo n't be considered a hurricane until those wind speeds reach 74 miles per hour . 
Experts think that could happen very soon . 
Officials announced hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic yesterday . 
Some predictions estimated that Irene could dump up to 20 inches of rain on parts of the Dominican Republic . 
There 's concern that heavy rain could trigger mudslides there ; that has happened before . 
AZUZ : Vice President Joe Biden has finished a trip to China . 
But this was the scene when he arrived in the country last Wednesday . 
He was there for five days meeting with Chinese leaders , and the biggest issue discussed during his visit was the U.S. economy . 
China has bought more U.S. debt that any other foreign country . 
So , officials there are concerned about America 's ability to manage that debt . 
During one speech , Vice President Biden explained why it 's important for the U.S. to protect Chinese and American investors . 
U.S. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : I read that some Chinese are concerned about your safety of your investments in American assets . 
But please understand no one cares more about this than we do , since Americans own 87 % of all our financial assets and 69 % of all our treasury bonds , while China owns 1 % of our financial assets and 8 % of our treasury bills , respectively . 
AZUZ : All right , shifting gears now . 
About 1.6 billion people -- just over a fifth of the world 's population -- are Muslim . 
And we 're in the middle of the most sacred time on the Muslim calendar . 
It 's called Ramadan , and it lasts for an entire month . 
Although there are disagreements about when exactly that month starts . 
Dan Gilgoff explains that -- and more -- about this observance . 
DAN GILGOFF , CNN.COM RELIGION EDITOR : Ramadan is the Islamic month of fasting . 
It 's meant to be a month of reflection , prayer and charity , detachment from worldly affairs . 
A month of purification . 
It 's one of the 5 pillars , or duties , of Islam . 
Ramadan is believed to be the month during which the prophet Mohammed started receiving the divine revelation , the Quran , or the Muslim holy book , from God , or Allah . 
And so , the most holy night during Ramadan -- and of the entire Islamic year -- is called the night of power , and that 's the night which it is believed that Allah did start to reveal the text of the Quran to the prophet Mohammed in the year 610 . 
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar . 
And the Islamic calendar operates according to the lunar cycle , the cycle of the moon . 
And so every year , Ramadan moves up around 11 days earlier than the previous year . 
It 's supposed to begin with the sighting of the first new moon of that cycle . 
And every year , there are debates about when that first new moon becomes visible , so that various countries believe that they see the first new moon on various days and Ramadan will begin on different days in different countries . 
The fast is broken each night with what 's called the iftar meal , and it 's a meal that 's often times communal or banquet-style meal that 's eaten in a mosque . 
The fast each night is often broken with dates , which is believed to have dated to the time of Mohammed . 
Every year during Ramadan the international sale of dates just skyrockets . 
The month of Ramadan ends with the holiday called Eid ul-Fitr . 
It 's often simply just referred to as Eid . 
It is the start of the next lunar month after Ramadan . 
It 's a break the fast holiday that 's marked by a lot of celebrations and feasting with friends and families . 
A lot of mosques hold carnivals for a couple of days after Ramadan ends . 
TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! 
What historic figure once said , `` out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope '' ? 
If you think you know it , shout it out ! 
Was it : A -RRB- Queen Elizabeth II , B -RRB- Martin Luther King Jr. , C -RRB- John F. Kennedy or D -RRB- Mahatma Gandhi ? 
You 've got three seconds -- GO ! 
That phrase was part of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 's famous `` I Have a Dream '' speech in 1963 . 
That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! 
AZUZ : When Dr. King gave that speech , he was standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . 
Now , the civil rights leader will have his own memorial in the nation 's capital . 
The dedication ceremony being scheduled for next week . 
But we 've got a little virtual tour for you right now . 
The entrance , with the two stones that have been separated , is meant to symbolize the mountain of despair that Doctor King was talking about . 
And the single boulder inside is meant to be the stone of hope . 
There 's also an inscription wall inside the memorial featuring more than a dozen of Dr. Martin Luther King 's most famous quotations . 
AZUZ : Dr. King will join the other famous Americans who have memorials in Washington , D.C. . 
The question we 're asking on our blog is who else do you think should be honored with a national memorial ? 
Tell us your choices and your reasons why . 
We 're looking forward to your ideas . 
But please remember , it 's first names only on the blog . 
AZUZ : This Ohio mailman is used to delivering greetings to people on his route . 
Last week , he was the one getting the special greetings from all of them . 
That is because he was back home and delivering mail after spending a year serving in the Army National Guard in Afghanistan . 
Rob Lustig said he was overwhelmed by the homecoming . 
ROB LUSTIG , MAILMAN , AFGHAN WAR VETERAN , ARMY NATIONAL GUARD : I ca n't keep a smile off my face , because every time I look around there 's another sign . 
How are you doing ? 
I just want to thank my customers for the support and the balloons and their generosity and thoughtfulness . 
It makes me feel good . 
AZUZ : Makes us feel good , too . 
We 're going to stay in Ohio for today 's Before We Go segment and visit a national food festival . 
But these contestants are n't bobbing for apples . 
They 're bobbing for burgers ! 
And they 're doing it in a kiddie pool filled with ketchup . 
It 's just one of the competitions at the National Hamburger Festival . 
Another event : the hamburger eating contest . 
The winner there gobbled up a quarter pounder and 10 patties in five minutes . 
AZUZ : A victory like that deserves a patty on the back . 
It looks like there 's an a-bun-dance of fun going on there . 
We just hope you 'll ketchup with us tomorrow for more CNN Student News tomorrow . 
Man , these puns are making me hungry . 
I 'm Carl Azuz . 
Have a great day .

2011-08-21,"By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : Saif Gadhafi says the rebels are losing , insists `` we will not leave '' Libya Moammar Gadhafi slams the rebels ' `` lying campaign , '' vows their end is near A rebel official says that the `` coordinated '' Tripoli operation is `` going easily '' Heavy clashes broke out late Saturday in a Tripoli neighborhood , a resident says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan government and rebel officials offered wildly disparate views of the situation on the ground Sunday , as gunfire and explosions continued to rock Tripoli not far from the home of embattled leader Moammar Gadhafi . 
Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the ruler 's son and a top official in his regime , insisted on Libyan state-run television that the rebels were losing every battle -- saying so hours after his father told supporters that the `` traitors '' and their NATO allies were lying and nearing their end . 
This perspective , however , contrasted with reports from CNN reporters , witnesses and rebel officials that government forces continued to lose ground all around the North African nation and faced fresh attacks in the capital . 
Faithi Baja , political affairs chief for the rebel 's Transitional National Council , said early Sunday in a video statement that rebel fighters freshly launched operation inside Tripoli is `` going easily '' and they are inching toward Gadhafi 's Bab al-Azizia compound . 
Rebels capture Zawiya oil refinery `` The revolution from inside Tripoli has officially started -LRB- Saturday -RRB- evening in many parts ... of Tripoli , and is expected to spread to all of Tripoli , '' Jumma Ibrahim , a rebel spokesman from the western mountain region around Zintan , said hours earlier . 
Heavy clashes broke out Saturday night in at least one neighborhood in Tripoli , marked by intense gunfire , explosions and people screaming as they ran through the street , a resident told CNN . 
Gunfire and explosions have become normal occurrences in the capital , but CNN personnel on the ground for weeks report that the fighting appeared to be among the most intense yet . 
`` Most of the neighhoods in Tripoli are rising up , '' Jumma Ibrahim said . 
But speaking just before midnight in Tripoli , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim insisted that all is safe and `` in excellent condition . '' 
He said that the Libyan capital remains under government control , adding that the nearby highways remain open . 
He blamed small groups of `` armed gangs '' -- a term that Gadhafi loyalists have frequently applied to rebels -- for the blasts and gunfire heard overnight Saturday inside Tripoli . 
He insisted that government forces had put down the fighters `` within half an hour , '' making the statement at the same time gunfire continued to crackle intermittently around the capital . 
About two hours later , Moammar Gadhafi echoed his spokesman in claiming rebel officials were lying about the situation in Tripoli and beyond while predicting the six-month-long conflict would climax soon . 
In his audio address , broadcast on state-run TV , the Libyan leader blasted the rebel `` traitors '' and the NATO forces backing them as unethical and intent on destroying the county and ruining lives . 
And as he had done in a speech six days earlier , he tried to rally citizens to his side . 
`` A great thing , anyway , that despite the Christian air raids , you continue to be up in Tripoli , '' he said , an apparent reference to those who listened to his speech from Green Square . 
`` March forward , march forward , march forward . 
` Mayhem has broken out in Tripoli ' Libya rejects rebel claims about Gadhafi What could Libya be after Gadhafi ? 
`` They have lost and used everything , and their last resort is their lying campaign . 
Now , this is the ending , '' he added . 
The rebel spokesman , Jumma Ibrahim , claimed opposition fighters control the main intelligence operations building in Tripoli . 
He also said some Libyan army personnel had defected and joined the rebels in the vicinity of the capital 's airport , which he claimed the rebels were able to take over with their newfound support . 
Musa Ibrahim , the government spokesman , denied that the airport had switched hands -- insisting , as with the rest of Tripoli , it was safe and under the control of Gadhafi 's forces . 
CNN could not immediately confirm how significant the fighting was , including whether rebel fighters had taken control of any parts of the city , including the airport . 
Jumma Ibrahim , the rebel spokesman , said the clashes in Tripoli were `` planned by rebels inside Tripoli in the neighborhoods of Fashloum , Souq al-Juma , Ben Ashur ... and other places . '' 
This came after coordination with other anti-Gadhafi elements , added Baja . 
Musa Ibrahim confirmed that armed men had entered those three neighborhoods in the capital , but said they were confronted and defeated in a matter of minutes . 
Hours earlier , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim rejected rebel claims that the governments of Egypt , Morocco , Tunisia and Algeria have been asked to accept Gadhafi and his family . 
And Gadhafi , in his speech early Sunday morning , stated unequivocally that he is still in Libya . 
Officials from the United States and NATO , whose forces have launched scores of strikes on Gadhafi 's forces , also said they have no indication the Libyan leader is making preparations to leave . 
Whatever his next move , international pressure on Gadhafi appears to be growing . 
Tunisia -- Libya 's western neighbor that , until now , had been neutral in the conflict -- joined a host of other nations in recognizing the Transitional National Council as Libya 's legitimate government . 
A U.S. official said Friday that Gadhafi might be preparing for a `` last stand '' in Tripoli as a months-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances . 
A second U.S. official said the longtime leader 's plan could involve a final military offensive against civilians , launched from his last major strongholds around the Libyan capital . 
The officials , who have knowledge of the situation on the ground , did not want to be named because of the sensitive intelligence matters . 
While uncertain of how upcoming events will unfold , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday that U.S. officials in Benghazi have been working with the Libyan opposition `` on exactly what it 's going to look like post-Gadhafi . '' 
`` Impossible to say when he 'll go , but it 's clear that he will go , '' Toner told CNN . 
The fighting continues , meanwhile , on a number of fronts , including in the west , where fighting has raged for days over the strategic city of Zawiya , about 30 miles west of Tripoli and a major supply route to the capital . 
On Saturday , it appeared the rebels had taken control of all of Zawiya after pushing Gadhafi 's forces beyond the east gate , according to CNN 's Sara Sidner who is in the city . 
Artillery fire could be heard , and mortars were launched toward Zawiya on Saturday , she reported . 
Rebel fighters told Sidner that NATO had warned civilians to leave the main part of the city . 
NATO has not yet commented on that statement . 
Musa Ibrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said late Saturday that Gadhafi 's forces are surrounding Zawiya and still control it . 
Earlier , the rebels seized a major oil refinery in Zawiya and controlled only the western part of the city , said Hobab Jomaa , a rebel fighter . 
But Saif al-Islam Gadhafi sarcastically laughed at the idea the opposition would take Tripoli . 
And he was emphatic that he , his father and their supporters would not surrender . 
`` We are in our land , in our country , '' he said . 
`` We have no problem if it takes six months , one year or two years -- victory will be ours . 
This is our country , and we will not leave it . ''

A convoy of rebels entered a western neighborhood of the city , firing their weapons into the air . 
Rebels said the whole of the city was under their control except Gaddafi 's Bab Al-Aziziya-Jazeera stronghold , according to al-Jazeera Television . 
Gaddafi made two audio addresses over state television calling on Libyans to fight off the rebels . 
`` I am afraid if we do n't act , they will burn Tripoli , '' he said . 
`` There will be no more water , food , electricity or freedom . '' 
Gaddafi , a colorful and often brutal autocrat who has ruled Libya for over 40 years , said he was breaking out weapons stores to arm the population . 
His spokesman , Moussa Ibrahim , predicted a violent reckoning by the rebels . 
`` A massacre will be committed inside Tripoli if one side wins now , because the rebels have come with such hatred , such vendetta ... Even if the leader leaves or steps down now , there will be a massacre . '' 
NATO , which has backed the rebels with a bombing campaign , said the transition of power in Libya must be peaceful . 
After a six-month civil war , the fall of Tripoli came quickly , with a carefully orchestrated uprising launched on Saturday night to coincide with the advance of rebel troops on three fronts . 
Fighting broke out after the call to prayer from the minarets of the mosques . 
Rebel National Transitional Council Coordinator Adel Dabbechi confirmed that Gaddafi 's younger son Saif Al-Islam had been captured . 
His eldest son Mohammed Al-Gaddafi had surrendered to rebel forces , he told Reuters . 
Only five months ago Gaddafi 's forces were set to crush the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , the leader warning in a television address that there would be `` no mercy , no pity '' for his opponents . 
His forces , he said , would hunt them down `` district to district , street to street , house to house , room to room . '' 
The United Nations then acted quickly , clearing the way for creation of a no-fly zone that NATO , with a campaign of bombing , used ultimately to help drive back Gaddafi 's forces . 
`` It 's over . 
Gaddafi 's finished , '' said Saad Djebbar , former legal adviser to Libyan government . 
Al Jazeera television aired images of people celebrating in central Tripoli and tearing down posters of Gaddafi , which had dominated Libyan cities for decades . 
In Benghazi in the east , thousands gathered in a city-center square waving red , black and green opposition flag as news filtered through of rebel advances into Tripoli . 
`` It 's over ! '' 
shouted one man as he dashed out of a building , a mobile telephone clutched to his ear . 
Celebratory gunfire and explosions rang out over the city and cars blaring their horns crowded onto the streets . 
Overhead , red tracer bullets darted into a black sky . 
`` It does look like it is coming to an end , '' said Anthony Skinner , Middle East analyst , Maplecroft . 
`` But there are still plenty of questions . 
The most important is exactly what Gaddafi does now . 
Does he flee or can he fight ? '' 
`` In the slightly longer term , what happens next ? 
We know there have been some serious divisions between the rebel movement and we do n't know yet if they will be able to form a cohesive front to run the country . '' 
Gaddafi , in his second audio broadcast in 24 hours , dismissed the rebels as rats . 
`` I am giving the order to open the weapons stockpiles , '' Gaddafi said . 
`` I call on all Libyans to join this fight . 
Those who are afraid , give your weapons to your mothers or sisters . 
`` Go out , I am with you until the end . 
I am in Tripoli . 
We will ... win . '' 
A Libyan government official told Reuters that 376 people on both sides of the conflict were killed in fighting overnight on Saturday in Tripoli , with about 1,000 others wounded . 
A diplomatic source in Paris , where the government has closely backed the rebels , said underground rebel cells in the capital had been following detailed plans drawn up months ago and had been waiting for a signal to act . 
That signal was `` iftar '' -- the moment when Muslims observing the holy months of Ramadan break their daily fast . 
It was at this moment that imams started broadcasting their message from the mosques , residents said . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Hopefully gas prices come down . 
there is new ledership in libya ! 
no dought a great improvment over the presant leadership , I 'm sure freedom and liberty will now run rampent , this is a great day for somebody . 
Gaddafi must have ties and complications with communist and axis ideals . 
`` If '' this process removes him , all the better , `` if '' not , all the worse .

2011-08-21,"Aug 21 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels entered the capital Tripoli on Sunday with little sign of resistance from forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi in the Libyan leader 's last remaining stronghold in the North African nation . 
Following are reactions from analysts and political players to the fluid events unfolding in Libya following six months of fighting between rebels and Gaddafi 's forces . 
GEORGE JOFFE , NORTH AFRICA EXPERT AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY `` For the city to fall so easily shows that despite all the bluster of the Gaddafi regime , it had lost the confidence of the Libyan people a long time ago . 
`` The assault has been led by rebels from the Jebel Nafusa and Misrata and not by those from Benghazi and there is no guarantee they will accept the leadership of Benghazi . 
So we are entering a very dangerous phase . 
`` And then you still have the problem of Sirte . 
It has not yet been reduced . 
They may fight on and indeed Gaddafi may actually be there . 
They may not give up quite so easily . 
`` There are many people there who are invested in the regime and so you may have a new stage of the civil war . '' 
`` The rebels will want to get rid of every last vestige of the regime but I know of no effective plan or operation so far to rebuild the country . '' 
JOHN DRAKE , SENIOR RISK CONSULTANT , UK-BASED CONSULTANCY AKE `` Had the rebels marched into Tripoli in late February the situation would have been very different and the city may have fallen relatively quickly and easily . 
`` Now , after six months of fighting , the animosity between the two sides is likely to be a lot higher , so there is going to be a risk of violent retribution against those seen as having supported the regime over that time . '' 
ASHOUR SHAMIS , OPPOSITION ACTIVIST AND JOURNALIST `` The game is over for Gaddafi . 
There 's bound to be some resistance here and there but his forces seem to be falling apart . 
He no longer directs his men . 
`` I think most Libyans want his men to peacefully surrender but if they resist they will have to be fought . 
`` If rebel forces capture people who are wanted by The Hague court , they will have to keep them safe until they are handed over to Libyan legal authorities . 
`` What then happens to those persons arrested , in terms of whether they end up at The Hague court , will I think depend in part on how they conduct themselves -LRB- in custody -RRB- . '' 
ANTHONY SKINNER , MIDDLE EAST ANALYST , MAPLECROFT `` It does look like it is coming to an end . 
But there are still plenty of questions . 
The most important is exactly what Gaddafi does now . 
Does he flee or can he fight ? 
In the slightly longer term , what happens next ? 
We know there have been some serious divisions between the rebel movement and we do n't know yet if they will be able to form a cohesive front is to run the country . 
`` Looking further afield , it is obviously going to be very uncomfortable viewing for Assad in Syria . 
Obviously they are very different cases , particularly because of the outside military involvement in Libya . 
But it 's another sign that when you use brutal force against protesters , you lose legitimacy . 
It just inflames the situation and at the end of the day we have seen another regional leader forced from power . '' 
DANIEL KORSKI , SENIOR FELLOW , EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS `` The next few hours are key . 
From Iraq we know that the first days , weeks and months are key for any long-term stability . 
What happens to law and order , what happens to ex-loyalists is key . 
The worst that could happen is the collapse of the Gaddafi regime and a huge vacuum . 
The West must be there to support an orderly transition , resist crowing and taking the responsibility away from the Libyans yet make clear to the rebels they must hold to standards they felt Gaddafi never met . '' 
MOHAMMED ABDEL MALIK , LIBYAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVIST `` Actually I 'm numb . 
I do n't know what to feel . 
We just ca n't believe it 's true . 
I 'm really , really so proud to be a Libyan tonight . 
We 're so grateful . 
I 'm in Cairo at the moment . 
We 've received calls coming in from family inside Libya . 
Thank God they 're safe . 
`` There have been many calls from the imams to the young men that they should not kill or seek vengeance , and that if they catch anyone they should hand them over to the authorities . 
`` This has been a very honorable and highly moral revolution . '' 
HAYAT ALVI , LECTURER IN MIDDLE EAST POLITICS , US NAVAL WAR COLLEGE `` If indeed the rebels finish the job today , then this will have been a swift and decisive and incredibly determined effort on the part of the rebels , and the significance of Ramadan will certainly not go understated in the eyes of many in Libya and in the Islamic world . 
The role of NATO in this process over the last several months will definitely be praised . 
`` This also signifies a milestone for the post-colonial Middle East : The longest ruling dictator has fallen . 
I do n't think even the ouster\/overthrow of Ben Ali and Mubarak signaled such a symbolically significant political marker , which will reverberate in the most pronounced manner throughout the region . 
`` The fighting skills of the ragtag rebels in Libya will potentially inspire others as well . 
`` This is a momentous event . 
Gaddafi is history - this time not just rhetorically , but very literally . '' 
MANSOUR EL-KIKHIA , LIBYAN PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO `` I 'm elated . 
I feel happiness that we 've got rid of this monster , mixed with fear about what may come next . 
Will the National Transitional Council be wise enough to bring the people together ? 
I have no choice but to be optimistic , although things have happened a bit too quickly and I really wanted to digest every moment . ''

2011-08-21,"LONDON | Sun Aug 21 , 2011 12:37 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebel forces ill-equipped to fight their way into a city the size of Tripoli may look to locally brokered deals or a burgeoning popular uprising to break the will of Muammar Gaddafi 's forces . 
Libya 's civil war so far has involved some serious urban fighting in towns such as Misrata , but most battles have been relatively small skirmishes . 
If Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi retains the loyalty of large numbers of security forces in the capital , the ragtag opposition forces could struggle and there would be little NATO air strikes could do without risking civilians . 
`` I 'm assuming the Tripoli fighting could be the fiercest , '' said Hayat Alvi , lecturer in Middle East politics at the United States Naval War College . 
`` The wild card will be the Tripoli public . 
True loyalties will have to finally manifest themselves . 
I 'm predicting in the rebels ' favor , but we do n't know what Gaddafi and his sons have up their sleeves . '' 
Gauging the loyalty of Tripoli 's population is far from easy . 
Gaddafi loyalists have put on many marches and demonstrations of loyalty in recent months , but hundreds if not thousands of his opponents also took to the streets in the early stages of the uprising before they were cowed . 
The rebels will hope security forces will melt away . 
Some say Gaddafi himself might already have fled , perhaps to his hometown of Sirte or a desert base further south . 
The long speeches at boisterous public meetings have given way to broadcast addresses delivered on scratchy telephone lines . 
But others say the nascent uprising reported in Tripoli on Saturday night might have come too soon , with opposition forces still too far away to help . 
Despite rhetoric of taking Tripoli and ending the war in hours or days , some analysts suspect it is more likely the rebels will cement their stranglehold on the city and then see how events play out . 
`` I think they 'll wait on the outskirts and hope for either an uprising or that Gaddafi decided to call it a day and leaves , '' said David Hartwell , Middle East analyst for IHS Jane 's . 
`` If they do go in , they could find it very difficult and they will be keen to avoid that . 
It 's relatively obvious that NATO has been providing close air support for the rebels . 
`` That 's one thing in open countryside or lightly populated areas -- although it pushes the Security Council mandate , to put it mildly -- but it would be almost impossible in Tripoli . '' 
Gaddafi 's government seems keen to broker some kind of last-minute ceasefire that would keep them in power . 
But few believe either the rebels or NATO would agree to that at this stage . 
In Paris , a diplomatic source said rebel cells undercover in Tripoli were putting into action plans prepared months ago . 
He said , however , the rebels were under orders not to enact revenge killings or summary executions against senior members of Gaddafi 's camp . 
Saad Djebbar , a former lawyer for the Libyan government , told Reuters he believed many key figures loyal to Gaddafi had already fled to other countries in Africa such as Niger , Mali and Chad where they had good contacts . 
`` The big sharks have already left the scene , he said . 
`` It 's not going to be Stalingrad . 
Tripoli is very small . 
People know each other . 
People negotiate their way forward . 
Gaddafi is bound to have some people who will put up a symbolic fight . 
But these are mostly thugs and there is no organized force left of any size to check the rebels . '' 
If the rebels are wrong and significant Gaddafi forces remain , strategists say they could be in serious trouble . 
Urban warfare is notoriously challenging and bloody , giving a clear advantage to the defender , while some doubt the opposition have sufficient supply lines to sustain an offensive . 
`` The costliness of urban fighting can not be overestimated , '' said political risk consultancy Stratfor in a note . 
`` Such warfare requires a well-trained force with high morale , and the rebel forces in the west are known to be few in number ... and extremely ill-trained . '' 
The key battle now , Stratfor said , was psychological -- with the rebel agenda to paint a picture of inevitable victory that would enthuse new uprisings and prompt Gaddafi loyalists to abandon their cause to save their necks . 
Much , of course , will depend on how Gaddafi himself chooses to play the endgame . 
He could still perhaps go into either internal or external exile or simply try to copy Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and disappear into the post-war chaos . 
Saddam evaded U.S. forces for months following the 2003 fall of Baghdad before they eventually tracked him down -- although most analysts believe such a scheme would prove tougher in Libya because of its more disparate geography . 
Even if opposition forces were able to take much of Tripoli relatively easily and bloodlessly , they might still struggle to take down the final remnants of the regime . 
Then , the situation could resemble that seen earlier this year in Ivory Coast , where opposition fighters loyal to Alassane Ouattara took much of the capital Abidjan but seemed unable to capture incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo . 
It took the actions of French helicopter gunships and troops already based in the country to eventually breach his compound and bunker , allowing his capture by local forces . 
The International Criminal Court in The Hague indicted Gadaffi , his eldest son and spy chief for crimes committed during their initial crackdown . 
That might yet prompt foreign military action to help the rebels capture him . 
`` I would have thought NATO would be very keen let the rebels get Gaddafi themselves as they possibly can , '' said IHS Jane 's Hartwell . 
`` But if it really came down to getting him out of a hole , you could see some Western involvement as we did in Abidjan . 
The ICC warrant could make it justifiable in that context . '' 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
They can simply cut off Tripoli from gasoline and electricity and wait . 
There seems to be enthusiasm in western media for the regime 's collapse , and this irrationally translates proximity of rebel forces to Tripoli into their imminent success . 
The regime seems poised to fall , but it wo n't come from gun-toting , untrained , western-backed rebels on the capitol 's fringes . 
The regime will fall when there is a mass popular uprising in the city , and when deals have been struck between high-level military leaders and -LRB- mostly external -RRB- parties that have an interest in the regime 's collapse . 
No patriot can give up a throne without a strong fight . 
NATO 's approach was lopsided and propelled a rebel group to try and take over so that NATO has puppets in power . 
Greed , barbarism led NATO to twist the UN mandate . 
The leaders in NATO countries could not allow for a better solution , they seem to have no regard for casualties of African or third world countries as long as the strategic interest of the west and achieved . 
NATO must let Libyans settle there own problems without ludicrous foreign interference with bombs . 
UN needs to stop this war now , if it really has any worth as a world and not a club for the western countries This discussion is now closed .

NEW YORK | Mon Aug 22 , 2011 4:46 pm BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Brent crude fell more than 1 percent on Monday as investors anticipated a resumption of oil exports from the OPEC-member Libya , where rebels moved to control most of Tripoli and an end to the 6-month-old civil war seemed close . 
Libyan government tanks and snipers put up scattered resistance in Tripoli after rebels swept into the heart of the capital , cheered on by crowds hailing the end of Muammar Gaddafi 's 42 years in power . 
`` A resolution of the conflict is modestly bearish for crude oil prices , but it is less likely that we will get a $ 10 - $ 20 drop in price of crude , '' Jason Schenker , president at Prestige Economics LLC in Austin , Texas , said in a note . 
`` While the fundamentals of the conflict resolution appear at first glance to be only bearish , it could turn out to be quite bullish , as it could engender further conflict in the region , '' Schenker said . 
Brent losses were limited by the dollar 's weakness . 
DXY and the greenback 's slip and a bounce by equities on Wall Street helped lift U.S. crude prices , for both the expiring front-month September and October contracts . 
The euro edged up , helped by a rise in European shares , while the dollar weakened on speculation that the Federal Reserve may show some indication this week about the need to take additional measures to support an ailing economy . 
ICE Brent October crude fell $ 1.25 to $ 107.37 a barrel by 11:09 a.m. -LRB- 4:09 p.m. BST -RRB- , having recover from a $ 105.15 intraday low . 
U.S. expiring September crude rose 84 cents to $ 83.10 a barrel , having reached as high as $ 84.30 . 
More actively traded October crude rose 79 cents to $ 83.20 a barrel . 
Brent 's premium to U.S. crude narrowed to $ 24.05 a barrel , after reaching a record $ 26.69 on Friday . 
Part of U.S. crude divergence from Brent is because traders are starting to bail out of their Brent\/U . 
S. spread positions , said Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute . 
Speculators raised slightly their long exposure to Brent in the week to August 16 , data from the Intercontinental Exchange showed . 
Selling by `` soft longs '' who increased exposure last week and profit taking by traders with long-held positions could put more short-term pressure on Brent , according to brokers . 
Libya pumped around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- , nearly 2 percent of global supply , before the war cut its output . 
Most of Libya 's high-quality crude flowed to European refiners . 
After Libyan exports ceased , tighter supply drove Brent to a two-year high of $ 127.02 in April . 
Production fell to almost nothing during the conflict but technical staff from Italy 's oil and gas major ENI -LRB- ENI . 
MI -RRB- have already arrived in Libya to look into restarting oil facilities . 
Some Libyan output will be able to restart in a few months , but it will take as long as 18 months to reach the prewar level , Libya 's former top oil official Shokri Ghanem said on Monday . 
"
2011-08-22,"BEIRUT | Mon Aug 22 , 2011 3:20 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- '' - The downfall of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is likely to pave the way for increased Western attention to Syria and embolden protests against President Bashar al-Assad . 
The implosion of Gaddafi 's rule after six months of civil war in which the rebels benefited from sanctions on Gaddafi , a no-fly zone and NATO air strikes may have implications for Syri 's six-month-old revolt and Assad 's efforts to crush it . 
`` The international community will now think that its strong intervention in the struggle -LRB- in Syria -RRB- will resolve the situation , '' said opposition figure Louay Hussein . 
`` Libya has raised the morale of the West and it will have a bigger excuse to intervene . 
But we reject any military action in Syria . '' 
Hussein and other opposition activists said however the events in Tripoli would revive Syrian protesters ' hopes . 
`` What happened in Libya means a lot for us , it means that the Arab spring is coming without doubt ... there is no solution to any problem without the will of the people , '' said Michel Kilo , a prominent opposition figure . 
No country has proposed the kind of action in Syria which NATO forces have carried out in Libya . 
But the West has called on Assad to step down and Washington has imposed new sanctions over his crackdown , in which the United Nations says 2,200 civilians have died . 
Syria has an alliance with Iran and a key role in Lebanon , despite ending a 29-year military presence there in 2005 . 
It also has influence in Iraq and supports militant groups Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah . 
Assad on Sunday said Syria would not bow to external pressure , which he said could only affect `` a president made in the United States and a subservient people who get their orders from outside . '' 
`` As for the threat of a military action ... any action against Syria will have greater consequences -LRB- on those who carry it out -RRB- , greater than they can tolerate , '' he said . 
Assad has responded to the unrest with a mixture of reforms and force . 
He granted citizenship to hundreds of thousands of ethnic Kurds , ended a state of emergency and promised to let groups other than his Baath party run in elections . 
Analysts and opposition figures said they expected the situation in Syria to deteriorate further , with authorities intensifying the crackdown and protesters not backing down . 
`` After what happened in Libya I think he -LRB- Assad -RRB- will be tougher with the security option he is taking , '' Boumonsef said . 
`` He sees what -LRB- he calls -RRB- the international conspiracy on him will be stronger and now that Gaddafi is out of the way it will move toward him in full strength ... This is imminent . '' 
Some opposition figures expressed fears that Libya 's endgame might encourage voices among the opposition calling for the arming of a hitherto largely peaceful movement in Syria . 
`` I fear that some in the opposition who are in a hurry to end the regime , who we have always warned against repeating the Libyan example , will say now it has been successful and resort to arms , '' said Hussein , who was detained during the uprising . 
`` But we will resist such proposals , regardless of where they are coming from . '' 
The anti-Assad movement is fragmented . 
`` Despite everything that is happening , the opposition remains stuck over little issues like personal issues between its leaders , '' Kilo said . 
Boumonsef said it would try harder , with international help , to unify . 
`` The opposition will be motivated more . 
There is no return and -LRB- Assad 's -RRB- reforms will not stop anything . 
It is too late . '' 
Encouraged after Western leaders called on Assad to step down , Syrian opposition figures are holding talks in Istanbul to nominate a broad-based council that could aid in a transition of power if Assad is toppled . 
Unlike previous opposition conferences , which were marked by divisions between Islamists and liberals , participants said there was broad agreement on 120 nominees for the council from inside and outside Syria . 
The council would speak for dissidents in exile and activists on the ground , opposition figures told Reuters . 
But some poured cold water on the idea . 
`` There is no interest inside Syria in a conference happening outside because the public opinion and those inside Syria believe that what is happening outside is marginal , '' Kilo said . 
`` We do not need a transitional council ... the real challenge is not what should be done after the regime collapses but for us it is what should be done every day so that we remain standing . ''

2011-08-22,"Mon Aug 22 , 2011 1:18 pm EDT LONDON , Aug 22 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Gasoline barge prices in northwest Europe fell on Monday , mirroring weakness in crude as investors anticipated a resumption of oil exports from OPEC-member Libya as an end to a 6-month civil war seemed close . 
While price moves for crude futures and prompt delivery of products were relatively muted , prices for gasoline , naphtha and other oil products further down the curve moved sharply lower , leading to wide backwardation .

\* This was up from Thursday 's price assessment of around $ 930 a tonne cif NWE . 
\* Demand for blending naphtha into gasoline has been strong lately but this is not expected to last for much longer as the summer driving season draws to a close . 
\* Market participants also said that increased production of products that can be used in place of naphtha was pushing prices down further along the curve . 
\* `` Expectations are for increased production of condensate and LPG going forwards pressuring naphtha , '' a trader said .

2011-08-22,"The opinions expressed are his own . 
The Libyan Revolution has largely succeeded , and this is a moment of celebration , not only for Libyans but for a youth generation in the Arab world that has pursued a political opening across the region . 
The secret of the uprising s final days of success lay in a popular revolt in the working-class districts of the capital , which did most of the hard work of throwing off the rule of secret police and military cliques . 
It succeeded so well that when revolutionary brigades entered the city from the west , many encountered little or no resistance , and they walked right into the center of the capital . 
Muammar Qaddafi was in hiding as I went to press , and three of his sons were in custody . 
Saif al-Islam Qaddafi had apparently been the de facto ruler of the country in recent years , so his capture signaled a checkmate . 
-LRB- Checkmate is a corruption of the Persian shah maat , the king is confounded , since chess came west from India via Iran -RRB- . 
The end game , wherein the people of Tripoli overthrew the Qaddafis and joined the opposition Transitional National Council , is the best case scenario that I had suggested was the most likely denouement for the revolution . 
I have been making this argument for some time , and it evoked a certain amount of incredulity when I said it in a lecture in the Netherlands in mid-June , but it has all along been my best guess that things would end the way they have . 
I got it right where others did not because my premises turned out to be sounder , i.e. , that Qaddafi had lost popular support across the board and was in power only through main force . 
Once enough of his heavy weapons capability was disrupted , and his fuel and ammunition supplies blocked , the underlying hostility of the common people to the regime could again manifest itself , as it had in February . 
I was moreover convinced that the generality of Libyans were attracted by the revolution and by the idea of a political opening , and that there was no great danger to national unity here . 
I do not mean to underestimate the challenges that still lie ahead mopping up operations against regime loyalists , reestablishing law and order in cities that have seen popular revolutions , reconstituting police and the national army , moving the Transitional National Council to Tripoli , founding political parties , and building a new , parliamentary regime . 
Even in much more institutionalized and less clan-based societies such as Tunisia and Egypt , these tasks have proved anything but easy . 
But it would be wrong , in this moment of triumph for the Libyan Second Republic , to dwell on the difficulties to come . 
Libyans deserve a moment of exultation . 
I have taken a lot of heat for my support of the revolution and of the United Nations-authorized intervention by the Arab League and NATO that kept it from being crushed . 
I haven t taken nearly as much heat as the youth of Misrata who fought off Qaddafi s tank barrages , though , so it is OK . 
I hate war , having actually lived through one in Lebanon , and I hate the idea of people being killed . 
My critics who imagined me thrilling at NATO bombing raids were just being cruel . 
But here I agree with President Obama and his citation of Reinhold Niebuhr . 
You can t protect all victims of mass murder everywhere all the time . 
But where you can do some good , you should do it , even if you can not do all good . 
I mourn the deaths of all the people who died in this revolution , especially since many of the Qaddafi brigades were clearly coerced -LRB- they deserted in large numbers as soon as they felt it safe -RRB- . 
But it was clear to me that Qaddafi was not a man to compromise , and that his military machine would mow down the revolutionaries if it were allowed to . 
Moreover , those who question whether there were US interests in Libya seem to me a little blind . 
The US has an interest in there not being massacres of people for merely exercising their right to free assembly . 
The US has an interest in a lawful world order , and therefore in the United Nations Security Council resolution demanding that Libyans be protected from their murderous government . 
The US has an interest in its NATO alliance , and NATO allies France and Britain felt strongly about this intervention . 
The US has a deep interest in the fate of Egypt , and what happened in Libya would have affected Egypt -LRB- Qaddafi allegedly had high Egyptian officials on his payroll -RRB- . 
Given the controversies about the revolution , it is worthwhile reviewing the myths about the Libyan Revolution that led so many observers to make so many fantastic or just mistaken assertions about it . 
Qaddafi was a progressive in his domestic policies . 
While back in the 1970s , Qaddafi was probably more generous in sharing around the oil wealth with the population , buying tractors for farmers , etc. , in the past couple of decades that policy changed . 
He became vindictive against tribes in the east and in the southwest that had crossed him politically , depriving them of their fair share in the country s resources . 
And in the past decade and a half , extreme corruption and the rise of post-Soviet-style oligarchs , including Qaddafi and his sons , have discouraged investment and blighted the economy . 
Workers were strictly controlled and unable to collectively bargain for improvements in their conditions . 
There was much more poverty and poor infrastructure in Libya than there should have been in an oil state . 
Qaddafi was a progressive in his foreign policy . 
Again , he traded for decades on positions , or postures , he took in the 1970s . 
In contrast , in recent years he played a sinister role in Africa , bankrolling brutal dictators and helping foment ruinous wars . 
In 1996 the supposed champion of the Palestinian cause expelled 30,000 stateless Palestinians from the country . 
After he came in from the cold , ending European and US sanctions , he began buddying around with George W. Bush , Silvio Berlusconi and other right wing figures . 
Berlusconi has even said that he considered resigning as Italian prime minister once NATO began its intervention , given his close personal relationship to Qaddafi . 
It was only natural that Qaddafi sent his military against the protesters and revolutionaries ; any country would have done the same . 
No , it wouldn t , and this is the argument of a moral cretin . 
In fact , the Tunisian officer corps refused to fire on Tunisian crowds for dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , and the Egyptian officer corps refused to fire on Egyptian crowds for Hosni Mubarak . 
The willingness of the Libyan officer corps to visit macabre violence on protesting crowds derived from the centrality of the Qaddafi sons and cronies at the top of the military hierarchy and from the lack of connection between the people and the professional soldiers and mercenaries . 
Deploying the military against non-combatants was a war crime , and doing so in a widespread and systematic way was a crime against humanity . 
Qaddafi and his sons will be tried for this crime , which is not perfectly natural . 
There was a long stalemate in the fighting between the revolutionaries and the Qaddafi military . 
This idea was fostered by the vantage point of many Western observers , in Benghazi . 
It is true that there was a long stalemate at Brega , which ended yesterday when the pro-Qaddafi troops there surrendered . 
But the two most active fronts in the war were Misrata and its environs , and the Western Mountain region . 
Misrata fought an epic , Stalingrad-style , struggle of self-defense against attacking Qaddafi armor and troops , finally proving victorious with NATO help , and then they gradually fought to the west toward Tripoli . 
The most dramatic battles and advances were in the largely Berber Western Mountain region , where , again , Qaddafi armored units relentlessly shelled small towns and villages but were fought off -LRB- with less help from NATO initially , which I think did not recognize the importance of this theater -RRB- . 
It was the revolutionary volunteers from this region who eventually took Zawiya , with the help of the people of Zawiya , last Friday and who thereby cut Tripoli off from fuel and ammunition coming from Tunisia and made the fall of the capital possible . 
Any close observer of the war since April has seen constant movement , first at Misrata and then in the Western Mountains , and there was never an over-all stalemate . 
The Libyan Revolution was a civil war . 
It was not , if by that is meant a fight between two big groups within the body politic . 
There was nothing like the vicious sectarian civilian-on-civilian fighting in Baghdad in 2006 . 
The revolution began as peaceful public protests , and only when the urban crowds were subjected to artillery , tank , mortar and cluster bomb barrages did the revolutionaries begin arming themselves . 
When fighting began , it was volunteer combatants representing their city quarters taking on trained regular army troops and mercenaries . 
That is a revolution , not a civil war . 
Only in a few small pockets of territory , such as Sirte and its environs , did pro-Qaddafi civilians oppose the revolutionaries , but it would be wrong to magnify a handful of skirmishes of that sort into a civil war . 
Qaddafi s support was too limited , too thin , and too centered in the professional military , to allow us to speak of a civil war . 
Libya is not a real country and could have been partitioned between east and west . 
It requites no great prescience to see that this will all end up badly . 
Qaddafi s failure to collapse on schedule is prompting increasing pressure to start a ground war , since the NATO operation is , in terms of prestige , like the banks Obama has bailed out , Too Big to Fail . 
Libya will probably be balkanized . 
I don t understand the propensity of Western analysts to keep pronouncing nations in the global south artificial and on the verge of splitting up . 
It is a kind of Orientalism . 
All nations are artificial . 
Benedict Anderson dates the nation-state to the late 1700s , and even if it were a bit earlier , it is a new thing in history . 
Moreover , most nation-states are multi-ethnic , and many long-established ones have sub-nationalisms that threaten their unity . 
Thus , the Catalans and Basque are uneasy inside Spain , the Scottish may bolt Britain any moment , etc. , etc. . 
In contrast , Libya does not have any well-organized , popular separatist movements . 
It does have tribal divisions , but these are not the basis for nationalist separatism , and tribal alliances and fissures are more fluid than ethnicity -LRB- which is itself less fixed than people assume -RRB- . 
Everyone speaks Arabic , though for Berbers it is the public language ; Berbers were among the central Libyan heroes of the revolution , and will be rewarded with a more pluralist Libya . 
This generation of young Libyans , who waged the revolution , have mostly been through state schools and have a strong allegiance to the idea of Libya . 
Throughout the revolution , the people of Benghazi insisted that Tripoli was and would remain the capital . 
Westerners looking for break-ups after dictatorships are fixated on the Balkan events after 1989 , but there most often isn t an exact analog to those in the contemporary Arab world . 
There had to be NATO infantry brigades on the ground for the revolution to succeed . 
Everyone from Cockburn to Max Boot -LRB- scary when those two agree -RRB- put forward this idea . 
But there are not any foreign infantry brigades in Libya , and there are unlikely to be any . 
Libyans are very nationalistic and they made this clear from the beginning . 
Likewise the Arab League . 
NATO had some intelligence assets on the ground , but they were small in number , were requested behind the scenes for liaison and spotting by the revolutionaries , and did not amount to an invasion force . 
The Libyan people never needed foreign ground brigades to succeed in their revolution . 
The United States led the charge to war . 
There is no evidence for this allegation whatsoever . 
When I asked Glenn Greenwald whether a US refusal to join France and Britain in a NATO united front might not have destroyed NATO , he replied that NATO would never have gone forward unless the US had plumped for the intervention in the first place . 
I fear that answer was less fact-based and more doctrinaire than we are accustomed to hearing from Mr. Greenwald , whose research and analysis on domestic issues is generally first-rate . 
As someone not a stranger to diplomatic history , and who has actually heard briefings in Europe from foreign ministries and officers of NATO members , I m offended at the glibness of an answer given with no more substantiation than an idee fixe . 
The excellent McClatchy wire service reported on the reasons for which then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , the Pentagon , and Obama himself were extremely reluctant to become involved in yet another war in the Muslim world . 
It is obvious that the French and the British led the charge on this intervention , likely because they believed that a protracted struggle over years between the opposition and Qaddafi in Libya would radicalize it and give an opening to al-Qaeda and so pose various threats to Europe . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy had been politically mauled , as well , by the offer of his defense minister , Mich le Alliot-Marie , to send French troops to assist Ben Ali in Tunisia -LRB- Alliot-Marie had been Ben Ali s guest on fancy vacations -RRB- , and may have wanted to restore traditional French cachet in the Arab world as well as to look decisive to his electorate . 
Whatever Western Europe s motivations , they were the decisive ones , and the Obama administration clearly came along as a junior partner -LRB- something Sen. John McCain is complaining bitterly about -RRB- . 
Qaddafi would not have killed or imprisoned large numbers of dissidents in Benghazi , Derna , al-Bayda and Tobruk if he had been allowed to pursue his March Blitzkrieg toward the eastern cities that had defied him . 
But we have real-world examples of how he would have behaved , in Zawiya , Tawargha , Misrata and elsewhere . 
His indiscriminate shelling of Misrata had already killed between 1000 and 2000 by last April , , and it continued all summer . 
At least one Qaddafi mass grave with 150 bodies in it has been discovered . 
And the full story of the horrors in Zawiya and elsewhere in the west has yet to emerge , but it will not be pretty . 
The opposition claims Qaddafi s forces killed tens of thousands . 
Public health studies may eventually settle this issue , but we know definitively what Qaddafi was capable of . 
This was a war for Libya s oil . 
Libya was already integrated into the international oil markets , and had done billions of deals with BP , ENI , etc. , etc. . 
None of those companies would have wanted to endanger their contracts by getting rid of the ruler who had signed them . 
They had often already had the trauma of having to compete for post-war Iraqi contracts , a process in which many did less well than they would have liked . 
ENI s profits were hurt by the Libyan revolution , as were those of Total SA . 
Moreover , taking Libyan oil off the market through a NATO military intervention could have been foreseen to put up oil prices , which no Western elected leader would have wanted to see , especially Barack Obama , with the danger that a spike in energy prices could prolong the economic doldrums . 
An economic argument for imperialism is fine if it makes sense , but this one does not , and there is no good evidence for it -LRB- that Qaddafi was erratic is not enough -RRB- , and is therefore just a conspiracy theory . 
This piece originally appeared on Professor Cole 's blog , Informed Comment . 
Mr Cole , Who do you get paid by to write up stories like that ? 
Why on Earth would the already bankrupt Western Governments throw a trillion dollars at this war ? 
For the love of the Libyan people ? 
You forgot to mention some key issues like the creation of the African Central Bank , the gold dinars , the African union by Ghaddafi , which effectively would have put the IMF out of business in Africa . 
In 2006 Tony Blair was buddy buddy with Ghaddafi and Ghaddafi 's sins were absolved . 
Why after such short time is he suddenly the evil tyrant again ? 
Protecting civilians by bombarding a country is an insult to intelligence . 
What are NATO 's real reasons to fork our a trillion dollars for this project ? 
At the end of the day there is not any country on earth where disgruntled citizens would not rise up to topple the government -- a little outside influence can whip up some support to mobilize these entities . 
Oh , and by all means include Democracies ! 
Yugoslavia was exemplary in that respect . 
Dictators do not grow on trees ! 
They are usually armed to the teeth by western powers . 
There are hundreds of examples of this . 
834.5 m worth of arms to Lybia over a five year period . 
UK , France and Italy being the main exporters profiting from these lucrative deals with Ghaddafi . 
Needless to say that Ghaddafi needed to give some concessions for these extravagant arm deals , like letting foreign oil companies to participate in exploration , give a piece of the banking system to the IMF etc. . 
But after 2009 he wisened up and would not budge . 
You are quoting Reinhold Niehbuhr and Obama , surely the best way to protect civilians is to sell their dictator arms , is n't it ? 
It is very sensible option , to provide a military dictator of 41 years , top notch weapons , especially to Ghadafi , who allegedly blew up the Pan Am flight , and provided breeding ground for terrorist - the largest number of suicide bombers for Iraq . 
Please explain how you get at the trillion dollar figure for this conflict ? 
Every source I check has it in 10 ? 
s of billions tops , that is 2 orders of magnitude difference . 
I agree why did Mr Cole not mention some other key issues like , the creation of the African Central Bank , the gold dinars , the African union . . 
And the IMF invovment ... Why leave out these key issues Mr Cole , you are better then that ... So this is an opinion piece , right ? 
How come is it that mass media outlets never have an opposing opinion piece questioning the legitimacy of the rebels , or the real agenda behind NATO involvement ? 
It 's all about falling in line and propagating the same bulls \* it that few informed people are actually buying . 
For someone who 's lived in `` various parts of the Muslim world for nearly 10 years '' , Juan Cole 's piece reads like a high-schoolers essay with poorly researched arguments and `` the opposition claims '' facts . 
It 's very discouraging at how disconnected media is from reality and how eager it is to fall in line with NATO foreign policy . 
Excellent article , I am sick and tired of people propagating these myths . 
Also I highly doubt any sane person is pro-gaddafi , only anti-NATO . 
This article is ridiculous . 
Please I ask you all to do your own research ... . 
`` Believe Nothing , No Matter Where You Read It , or Who Said It , No Matter If I Have Said It , Unless It Agrees with Your Own Reason and Your Own Common Sense . '' 
A well done article , I would have liked to see the myth of the revolutions Islamic motives . 
Over all you did a good job cutting to the heart of the issues .

2011-08-22,"LONDON | Mon Aug 22 , 2011 3:31 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Investors peering through the receding fog of war will find plenty of promise and a few pitfalls in a post-Gaddafi Libya . 
If peace takes hold in Africa 's largest oil producer after a six-month civil war , the long-dormant economy could rapidly flourish provided there has been no substantial damage to the oil and gas infrastructure underpinning its national wealth . 
Much remains undecided as anti-government forces gain control of Tripoli in their final push to end the four-decade rule of Muammar Gaddafi but a new Libyan government could herald a bonanza for Western companies and investors . 
`` Libya is a fantastically wealthy country that does n't need foreign money but foreign expertise . 
This could be the start of an experiment in hydrocarbon-fueled capitalism with a lot of money up for grabs , '' said Emad Mostaque , Chief Middle East and North Africa strategist at Religare Capital Markets . 
Though less advanced than the rest of North Africa even prior to the civil war , the Libyan economy has ample resources it could marshal for national reconstruction . 
An estimated $ 150 billion in sovereign assets once controlled by Gaddafi and his inner circle has been frozen abroad by foreign governments and 144 tonnes of gold is held by the Libyan central bank . 
Combine that with a modest population of 6.4 million and standards of education on a par with established emerging economies such as Malaysia and Mexico , and Libya looks well placed for recovery , said Sven Richter , head of frontier markets at Renaissance Asset Managers . 
`` From that point of view , they are in a quite enviable position , '' he said . 
A sovereign wealth fund set up in 2006 to manage Libya 's oil revenues could also prove pivotal if the new government does not purge all personnel associated with Gaddafi . 
Though somewhat depleted , the Libyan Investment Authority still holds billions of dollars in cash and a number of lucrative equity stakes in Western blue-chip companies such as Pearson -LRB- PSON . 
L -RRB- and UniCredit -LRB- CRDI . 
It could spearhead infrastructure development and make up for some of this year 's slump in foreign direct investments , which according to United Nations data swelled Libya 's coffers by $ 3.8 billion last year . 
Investment from the fund could also help broaden the Libyan economy away from oil and help attract other sovereign wealth funds and longer term foreign investors . 
`` In the last couple of weeks , there have been increasing questions about the unity of the rebels , especially after the killing of General Abdel Fattah Younes just 12 days ago , '' said Raza Agha , MENA economist at RBS . 
The death of the rebel military commander after he was taken into custody by his own side for questioning remains unexplained , underscoring the disparate nature of the rebel National Transitional Council as a mix of Gaddafi opponents . 
`` Beyond Gaddafi , there is a lack of any unifying institution or individual . 
In Egypt and Tunisia , for example , the military was held in high esteem by the population , '' said Agha . 
If it can hold together , the new government is likely to be friendly toward the West , having come into power supported by NATO air strikes . 
An official at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO has already said the company may have difficulties working with China , Russia and Brazil which opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi . 
So Western companies look well positioned as billions of dollars in oil exploration and construction contracts come up for grabs as part of the reconstruction effort . 
Religare 's Mostaque also expects Qatari banks and firms to benefit when Libya reopens its doors to investment . 
Qatar was quick to establish links with Libyan rebels and was the first Arab country to contribute planes to police United Nations-backed no-fly zones over the country . 
Until fighting broke out in February , Libya was the world 's 12th largest oil exporter though its output was modest , coming in at about 1.6 million barrels a day or 2 percent of global oil output . 
The disruption of Libyan supply was thus easily compensated by increased Saudi production . 
The incoming government will likely focus on raising the country 's production capacity with a view to capitalizing on its oil reserves , the ninth largest in the world . 
Investors also see potential in Libya 's banking and insurance sector , which briefly enjoyed foreign investor interest when decades of Western sanctions were lifted in 2004 . 
France 's BNP Paribas -LRB- BNPP . 
PA -RRB- took a minority stake in a local bank when banking rules were eased and Renaissance 's Richter expects foreign interest to revive when stability returns . 
`` Financial services demand will be driven by the oil industry , '' he said .

NEW YORK | Tue Aug 23 , 2011 4:08 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil rose on Tuesday along with equities on hopes that the Federal Reserve might indicate fresh stimulus measures later this week , with oil also drawing support from fighting in Libya and disrupted Nigerian exports . 
Major stocks indexes rose more than 2 percent as investors jumped into the market before a highly anticipated address by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later this week in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , where policymakers and academics meet once a year . 
Some investors expect Bernanke to signal more Fed quantitative easing measures ahead to stimulate a sluggish U.S. economy . 
`` This is a rally driven on hopes of Bernanke saying something about more stimulus , '' said Bill O'Grady of Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis . 
`` In Libya , rebels are in an urban warfare situation and Gaddafi has n't fallen , increasing the risk of oil disruptions and a lengthy period before production can resume . ''

Trade sources said the entire Bonny Light program of around 200,000 barrels per day in exports has been withdrawn . 
Crude rose early on Tuesday , following manufacturing data from China and Germany that was less gloomy than some economists had expected . 
The data helped to boost the euro against the U.S. dollar , which slid about 0.3 percent against a basket of foreign currencies . 
A weaker dollar can boost oil prices by making crude cheaper for foreign currency holders . 
Weaker U.S. home sales data in July did nothing to curb a stock market rally , as some investors read the data as justification for more Fed stimulus . 
Rebels gained control over large portions of Libyan capital Tripoli , but some forces remaining loyal to the Muammar Gaddafi regime fought back in street battles . 
Rebels said they had gained control of a key Libyan oil export terminal , Ras Lanuf , and found it intact with no damage . 
But many analysts do not expect Libyan crude exports to restart quickly after being shut for months during a civil war . 
Brent 's premium to U.S. crude fell below $ 23 a barrel intraday , before expanding again to around $ 24 . 
The spread has narrowed after reaching a record high $ 26.69 on Friday .

2011-08-23,"Tue Aug 23 , 2011 4:05 pm EDT \* Limited Libyan oil production could start soon \* Condition of oil export terminals still unclear \* Clearing pipes clogged by waxy crude could delay output By David Sheppard and Sarah Young NEW YORK\/LONDON , Aug 23 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Limited Libyan oil production ought to resume quite quickly as most fields appear to have survived the civil war unscathed , international oil services companies say , but many are still waiting for more stability in the country before sending employees back in . 
In interviews with some of the biggest oil services players in pre-civil war Libya , most echoed the view that major oil fields had largely avoided serious damage during the six months of fighting , though some voiced concerns about damage to export terminals and pipelines . 
OPS International Chairman Gavin De Salis told Reuters Insider television that Libyan crude oil , prized for its high yield of valuable light products such as gasoline and for its low sulfur content , was quite waxy , which could clog up pipelines if they had been left unused for some time . 
`` There might be a little bit of effort unplugging pipelines , which is two to three months ' worth of effort before they can resume full production , '' De Salis said . 
`` But that will not affect all of the pipelines or all of the fields , so they can certainly start limited production quite quickly . '' 
Nilsson said contacts at Libya 's rebel oil firm Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- informed him there had been little damage to the oilfields in the east of the country during the six-month power struggle . 
`` We have n't been able to work at the oilfields during the civil war as it has not been safe , but I think within a couple of weeks we could be back to almost normal , '' Nilsson said by telephone from his office in Stockholm . 
`` The oil income is essential to Libya and the new government so they will want to bring it back online as soon as possible . '' 
Nilsson said they had several Swedish , Indian and Sudanese employees who had stayed in the country during the civil war , but total staff numbers in the country were down from around 250-300 . 
He said he expected international employees to start returning to Libya in about a month 's time . 
DAMAGE Oil firm 's who supported the rebel government during the civil war are expected to win the lion 's share of contracts to help relaunch the Libyan oil industry , which before the war produced some 1.6 million barrels per day of crude . 
Those based in countries that were quick to back military action by NATO , including France , Britain and the United States , are thought to be particularly well positioned . 
PA -RRB- , the Paris-based oil services and engineering firm , said it did n't have any employees in Libya at the present time , but it expected to play a role in helping oil and gas companies quickly resume production . 
Oil major 's like Italy 's ENI -LRB- ENI . 
MI -RRB- , the largest producer in Libya before the outbreak of fighting , is positioning for an early return to Libya . 
Analysts said getting production back up to speed quickly could help its `` good will '' with any new government , after it was seen as slow to distance itself from Muammar Gaddafi at the start of the conflict . 
Samuel Ciszuk , Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy said oil fields in the south west of the country had largely escaped the fighting , and said production throughout Libya could rise to 250,000-350 ,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- within three months . 
`` Planning for the post-war recovery seems to be in full swing with both international oil companies -LRB- IOCs -RRB- , as well as oil service companies , starting to prepare for swift deployment of key personnel to assist with production start-ups and repairs , '' Ciszuk said . 
`` In the south-west , where no fighting occurred and where the effects of looting and vandalism are thought to be low , production ... could start rising towards the pre-war 200,000 bpd level perhaps as soon as the pipeline to the coast is repaired and cleaned of potential residues . '' 
The oil port of Ras Lanuf saw some of the heaviest fighting in the war , but a rebel spokesman said there was no apparent damage to facilities after pro-Gaddafi forces retreated from the area on Tuesday . 
-LRB- ID : nLDE77M0VJ -RRB- NEW OPPORTUNITIES Oil services group Petrofac -LRB- PFC. L -RRB- , that was n't active in pre-civil war Libya , said it now saw more opportunities in the country . 
`` Whilst short term developments are difficult to predict , Libya has substantial oil and gas reserves and restoring production will be key to getting the Libyan economy going again , '' Petrofac 's chief financial officer Keith Roberts said . 
`` Over the medium to long term there are considerable opportunities in the country , and therefore we see the prospects for the services industry as very positive . 
The question is how long and difficult the transition will be , '' But some experienced players in Libya injected a note of caution as to how long it would be before there was enough stability in the country to resume work there , both in terms of violence and the resolution of existing contracts . 
`` I am sure that whatever government emerges will put a real priority on getting the oil industry into good shape but historically things have taken a long time in Libya , '' Allister Langlands , chief executive of oil services firm Wood Group said on Tuesday . 
`` It 's too early to say more than that . ''

2011-08-23,"MILAN | Tue Aug 23 , 2011 12:17 pm EDT MILAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Eni , the biggest foreign oil producer in Libya before the civil war , could lose assets or opportunities in the long run if Italy 's hesitant support for the rebel government early in the conflict leads to a backlash . 
The rebels , who are close to winning a six-month war against Muammar Gaddafi , have already said firms from Russia and China could fall out of favor for the lack of support for the uprising , thus opening the doors to companies from Britain , France and the United States to gain more assets . 
`` In the short-to-mid term I see no risk for Eni . 
Any new government will need cash and that means getting production onstream fast . 
To do that they 'll need Eni , '' said Stefano Casertano , senior fellow at German think-tank BIGS-Potsdam . 
`` We 'll see further on if there 's a diplomatic-type attack for access to what Eni controls , '' he added . 
While Italy hesitated , Britain , France and the U.S. led the early drive for intervention in Libya to protect the rebels . 
Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi , long Gaddafi 's closest European ally , was silent in the initial days of the uprising in February , and his government 's calls for Gaddafi to step down were much more subdued than those of European peers . 
Berlusconi has also said he was against NATO intervention in Libya but was forced to go along with it . 
His main coalition partner , the Northern League , has long opposed intervention . 
In March , Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni called on Europe to abandon sanctions against Libya in an attempt to rebuild bridges when Gaddafi had seemed to be regaining control of the country . 
A diplomatic source in Rome told Reuters last month Italy 's initially subdued condemnation of Gaddafi followed by an abrupt switch in April to fully back the rebels had damaged its credibility and could prove costly in the long run . 
Italy has recently moved fast to seize back the initiative . 
Berlusconi said he will meet Libyan rebel leader Mahmoud Jibril , and Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said Eni staff were in Libya to try to restart oil facilities , adding , `` It is clear Eni will play a No. 1 role in the future . '' 
France 's Total is an active player in Libya . 
Britain 's BP has assets there but no production , as does Royal Dutch Shell . 
U.S. groups Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips are also active . 
Gaddafi 's fall could give new players such as Qatar 's national oil company and trading house Vitol opportunities . 
Qatar was quick to establish links with Libyan rebels and was the first Arab country to give planes to police no-fly zones . 
`` There is obviously some benefit to the countries that helped the Libyans in the crisis , but that advantage can go quite quickly . 
So British companies and French companies would want to get there as quickly as possible , '' Gavin De Salis , chairman of oil services firm OPS International , told Reuters Insider . 
Eni , in Libya since the 1950s , produced about 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010 . 
Its oil production contracts are in force to 2042 and gas contracts to 2047 . 
`` Eni getting production restarted fast would win it good will with any new government in Libya , '' said Justin Jacobs , oil and gas analyst at Business Monitor International . 
Eni has said that if stability returns , it would take one year to restart oil production and two to three months for gas . 
On Tuesday the Libyan rebel envoy to Italy said he expected Italian contracts to be respected in a post-Gaddafi era . 
Russia and China opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi , and some say energy companies there could feel a backlash . 
`` We do n't have a problem with Western countries like Italians , French and UK companies . 
But we may have some political issues with Russia , China and Brazil , '' said Abdeljalil Mayouf , information head at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO . 
Russian companies , including oil firms Gazprom Neft and Tatneft , had projects worth billions of dollars in Libya before the conflict started . 
China , which took 3 percent of its imported crude from Libya last year , had about 75 companies operating there . 
`` The Chinese and Russians were reticent to step in and play an active pro-rebel role . 
Certainly European and U.S. companies stand to benefit from that , '' said Jacobs . 
Before the war , Gazprom Neft agreed to buy a stake from Eni in Libya 's Elephant field , but that has been put on hold . 
Eni is a strategic partner of Gazprom . 
Going forward , much will depend on what a future rebel government will look like and where its sympathies lie . 
`` The big question is who the rebels are . 
I do n't think we 've seen the real leadership yet , which will probably be made up of new figures , '' said Karim Mezran , professor for Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Bologna . 
`` And another big issue is unfreezing Libyan assets . 
How the European countries handle that one could give them leverage for their own oil companies . ''

2011-08-23,"WASHINGTON | Tue Aug 23 , 2011 1:09 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels appeared to be in control of most of Tripoli , the Pentagon said on Tuesday , adding that it was sticking to its assessment that leader Muammar Gaddafi had not left the country . 
Calling the situation fluid , Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan said that Gaddafi 's forces remained dangerous even though their command capabilities had been diminished by major rebel advances into the heart of the capital and NATO air strikes . 
The United States , which is providing Predator drones and other air capabilities to the NATO mission , sharply stepped up the tempo of its air strikes on Libya over the past week and a half , according to Pentagon data . 
`` It 's still very fluid , there 's still fighting going on , '' Lapan said . 
`` While we believe that opposition forces control a large part of the country , Libya and Tripoli in particular are still very dangerous places . '' 
Asked specifically about Tripoli , Lapan said the situation was too fluid to put a precise percentage on how much of the city was under rebel control . 
Rebel leaders say 80 percent of the Libyan capital is now controlled by forces opposed to Gaddafi . 
`` Majority -LRB- control of Tripoli -RRB- is safe but I would n't get beyond that , '' he said . 
The United States was monitoring Libya 's chemical weapons sites , Lapan said , amid concern in Congress that those and other Libyan weapons could fall into the wrong hands . 
Lapan said he was aware of a total of two Scud missile launches by Gaddafi forces . 
A U.S. official told Reuters that neither caused any injuries or deaths . 
`` Regime forces are going to use whatever means they have to continue to inflict damage on their opponents and on the civilian population , '' he said . 
The Pentagon said on Monday that it believed Gaddafi had not left the country , a position Lapan reaffirmed on Tuesday , saying : `` Nothing 's changed . '' 
Still , he did not offer any more precise assessment about Gaddafi 's potential whereabouts . 
Gaddafi 's son and presumed heir Saif al-Islam told a crowd that his father was well and still in Tripoli , confounding reports of his capture . 
Asked whether the Pentagon was surprised by the emergence of Gaddafi 's son , whom the rebels had initially said was in their hands , Lapan said : `` We 've seen conflicting reports . 
Again it goes back to a very fluid situation ... We continue to see conflicting reports about the whereabouts certain individuals . ''

2011-08-23,"\* Limited Libyan oil production could start soon \* Condition of oil export terminals still unclear \* Clearing pipes clogged by waxy crude could delay output By David Sheppard and Sarah Young NEW YORK\/LONDON , Aug 23 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Limited Libyan oil production ought to resume quite quickly as most fields appear to have survived the civil war unscathed , international oil services companies say , but many are still waiting for more stability in the country before sending employees back in . 
In interviews with some of the biggest oil services players in pre-civil war Libya , most echoed the view that major oil fields had largely avoided serious damage during the six months of fighting , though some voiced concerns about damage to export terminals and pipelines . 
OPS International Chairman Gavin De Salis told Reuters Insider television that Libyan crude oil , prized for its high yield of valuable light products such as gasoline and for its low sulfur content , was quite waxy , which could clog up pipelines if they had been left unused for some time . 
`` There might be a little bit of effort unplugging pipelines , which is two to three months ' worth of effort before they can resume full production , '' De Salis said . 
`` But that will not affect all of the pipelines or all of the fields , so they can certainly start limited production quite quickly . '' 
Nilsson said contacts at Libya 's rebel oil firm Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- informed him there had been little damage to the oilfields in the east of the country during the six-month power struggle . 
`` We have n't been able to work at the oilfields during the civil war as it has not been safe , but I think within a couple of weeks we could be back to almost normal , '' Nilsson said by telephone from his office in Stockholm . 
`` The oil income is essential to Libya and the new government so they will want to bring it back online as soon as possible . '' 
Nilsson said they had several Swedish , Indian and Sudanese employees who had stayed in the country during the civil war , but total staff numbers in the country were down from around 250-300 . 
He said he expected international employees to start returning to Libya in about a month 's time . 
Oil firm 's who supported the rebel government during the civil war are expected to win the lion 's share of contracts to help relaunch the Libyan oil industry , which before the war produced some 1.6 million barrels per day of crude . 
Those based in countries that were quick to back military action by NATO , including France , Britain and the United States , are thought to be particularly well positioned . 
PA -RRB- , the Paris-based oil services and engineering firm , said it did n't have any employees in Libya at the present time , but it expected to play a role in helping oil and gas companies quickly resume production . 
Oil major 's like Italy 's ENI -LRB- ENI . 
MI -RRB- , the largest producer in Libya before the outbreak of fighting , is positioning for an early return to Libya . 
Analysts said getting production back up to speed quickly could help its `` good will '' with any new government , after it was seen as slow to distance itself from Muammar Gaddafi at the start of the conflict . 
Samuel Ciszuk , Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy said oil fields in the south west of the country had largely escaped the fighting , and said production throughout Libya could rise to 250,000-350 ,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- within three months . 
`` Planning for the post-war recovery seems to be in full swing with both international oil companies -LRB- IOCs -RRB- , as well as oil service companies , starting to prepare for swift deployment of key personnel to assist with production start-ups and repairs , '' Ciszuk said .

"
2011-08-23,"The opinions expressed are his own . 
Thomas Jefferson once said rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God . 
The Arab Spring is reminding the world that struggles for dignity , freedom , justice and human rights spring from our deepest aspirations as human beings . 
At the same time the dictatorial violence in Syria and Libya remind us of the evil that springs from the insatiable will to absolute power . 
The repression in Syria has claimed more than 2,200 lives according to the United Nations . 
Thankfully , the bloodshed is coming to an end in Libya , but it must be remembered that in Libya , unlike Tunisia and Egypt , it took a bloody civil war and NATO intervention to destroy the decades-long tyranny of Muammar Gaddafi . 
Events in Libya compel us to reflect on fundamental moral questions that are larger than geopolitics and the price of petroleum . 
But it is impossible to reflect on those moral questions without scrutinizing the compromising attitudes that stem from our acute concerns about national security and access to cheap oil . 
In September 2004 the United States lifted economic sanctions leveled against the Gaddafi regime in response to its most egregious act of terror -- the destruction of Pan 103 in December 1988 . 
The Bush administration restored full diplomatic relations two years later . 
It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . 
Pan Am 103 was not Gaddafi s only act of terror : his intelligence service was behind the destruction of a TWA flight in 1974 and sponsored the Abu Nidal organizations acts of terrorism well into the 1980s -- acts that included the slaughter of American children in airports in Vienna and Rome . 
President Reagan quite rightly called Gaddafi the mad dog of the Middle East . 
The Bush administration cited Gaddafi s shrewd decision to dismantle a crude nuclear weapons program and its payment of reparations to the families of the victims of Pan Am 103 to justify the opening of an American embassy in Tripoli . 
Neither of these empty gestures translated into a fundamental change in the nature of the Gaddafi tyranny . 
Gaddafi cunningly suspended the foreign terror operations but continued to terrorize the Libyan people with the confidence of a tyrant with a new lease on life . 
President Bush never openly condemned the repression in Libya , despite his lofty rhetoric about America 's commitment to democracy in the Middle East at the onset of the war in Iraq . 
The appeasement with Libya was always about petroleum , never about principle . 
September 11 deepened the Bush administration s disturbing relationship with Gaddafi . 
The administration secretly reached out to Libyan intelligence to cooperate in the global war on terrorism . 
In their memoirs , former CIA officials describe surreal meetings with Libyan intelligence chieftains whom they suspected of involvement in the destruction of Pan Am 103 . 
Libyan officials were only too pleased to identify , detain and torture Libyans who gravitated to Al Qaeda at the behest of the CIA . 
Perhaps the collaboration with Libyan intelligence seemed like a morally acceptable compromise after the slaughter of Americans on 9\/11 , but the secret partnership with Gaddafi served emboldened him in his secret campaign to ratchet up the repression in Libya . 
If rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God , then surely compromise with tyrants smacks of a pact with the devil . 
The challenge of reconciling U.S. economic and security interests with American values has always vexed Americans in high office . 
But Libya under Gaddafi was a simple case of moral and political discernment . 
The United States failed that test badly . 
America gained nothing of lasting value from its relationship with Gaddafi . 
It only bought a tyrant more time , and cost more Libyan lives .

REUTERS\/Bob Strong `` It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . '' 
The U.S. has supported many brutal tyrants : Saddam Hussein , Augusto Pinochet , Hosni Mubarak , Doc Chevalier , the Shah of Iran , Ferdinand Marcos , Suharto , and Somoza just to name a few . 
Supporting Gaddafi falls into the category of normal U.S. geopolitics . 
Americans having been willing , decade after decade , to vote for leaders who have supported brutal dictators around the world . 
Where then is the conflict with American values ? 
American values seem to include supporting dictators around the world whenever various geopolitical goals are at stake . 
`` It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . '' 
Bush brought Gaddafi back into the international fold because Gaddafi renounced nuclear weapons . 
You think that 's insignificant ? 
NATO is a big reason for the bloodshed in Libya today . 
Talk to the current president if you have a problem with that . 
And by the way , Gaddafi only dreamed of and talked about perpetrating the kind of violence against demonstrators that Syria 's Assad is actually doing . 
I do n't see America doing much about that , other than finger wagging . 
Although Republicans in the US often pain themselves as foreign policy experts , their actions and policies are often bizzare . 
In the late 90 ? 
The Bush administration officially praised the Taliban for helping to eradicate Afghanistan 's poppy crop about 6 months before the Sept 11 attacks . 
The whole Iraq war\/weapons of mass destruction thing speaks for itself . 
For the Bush administration , driven by a family so steeped in big oil , their crazy decisions all seemed to revolve around gaining access to oil fields , either through force or diplomacy . 
I believe McCain even cast doubt on Pakistan 's previously democratically elected leaders and praised the military dictator running Pakistan at that time . 
And with all of the military escapades of the Bush administration , when Obama announced limited US engagement in Lybia , the Republicans cried foul . 
George Bush Sr. ran a smooth and reasonable campaign to force Iraq out of Kuwait in the early 90 ? 
s. That is the last time I can remember a Republican running anything like a sane , coherent foreign policy .

I think it started more because of economic woes . 
Regarding Gaddafi renouncing nuclear weapons as being significant ... it was , and no dictator will ever do that again after what we just did . 
The Bush Administration was an institution without morals . 
Still , its legacy is vested in the Tea Party revolutionary movement of today . 
I presume the London School of Economics is mourning Gadaffi 's fall from power . 
If ever there was an fine example of lefties consorting with dictators -LRB- as the right correctly argues -RRB- LSE 's ` friendship ' with Gaddafi must be it . 
So much for standing up for the people . 
The left is all about grabbing power in any shape or form . 
Nothing for nothing , but I think you need to go back to your research and check on something ... `` acts that included the slaughter of American children in airports in Vienna and Rome . 
President Reagan quite rightly called Gaddafi the mad dog of the Middle East . 
While I think this is a little sensationalist to say that Americans were the primary targets in these attacks , these were attacks specifically against Israel and Israelis targeting El Al airlines ticket counters in Italy and Austria by Abu Nadil as retaliation against Israel for Operation Wooden Leg , where Israel bombed the PLO headquarters in Tunis -LRB- 10\/85 -RRB- . 
This had nothing to do with an attack on American children at all . 
I would suffice to say that if Americans were killed as additional damage , that Abu Nadil would n't have minded , however , that was not their main goal . 
All too reminiscent of our early ties with Saddam Hussein . 
We armed him to the teeth to be a counterweight to Iran and to guarantee the stability of Gulf oil . 
And then he began to feel invincible . 
We all know how that ended . 
Keep an eye an Saudi Arabia . 
We might see something similar happen there in the years to come . 
Thanks for explaining so much . 
Ms. Clinton continued the tradition of Gaddafi-coddling by a stubborn reluctance to support the rebels . 
Obama was finally shamed into doing some air support for rebels when France and Britain took the leadership . 
The Nato bombing started much too late . 
When Nato started air strikes , Gaddafi 's long exposed armored columns were now in the cities terrorizing citizens and the opportunity to wipe them out quickly was gone . 
Without a doubt Oil is always an issue for the US in the ME . 
The next issue is the welfare of Israel , still he only country actually eating another territory\/country alive . 
But the US has only itself to blame for its dependence on oil -- wherever the source . 
It had spent the last 50 plus years building urban areas enslaved by the automakers . 
Most of the oil it uses is for transportation and home heating costs . 
it also uses more than any other country on a daily for auto use alone . 
the last note got sent accidentally . 
The problem is -- there is no fix for suburban sprawl . 
It 's too diffuse and too expensive to service with adequate alternative transportation and many of the old rail lines are gone and their ROW 's are being eaten by encroachment by abutters or put to alternate uses like bicycle and hiking paths . 
The sprawl itself usually kills off any local agriculture so the urban areas ca n't feed themselves at all without trucking everything from thousands of miles away . 
I look at Google earth to view urban areas world wide and very few of them -- even the gigantic areas like Sao Paolo , Or Beijing and even most European Cities look they are still being constructed around rail lines or other public transportation systems . 
Large areas of Japan have become continuous city . 
But they have 180 million people I recall . 
The radiating valleys in the Kyoto area are continuous strips of farmsteads that all front on the common roads . 
It must be easy to run regular bus lines along any of them to the nearest located rail lines . 
As the country ages , it will become more difficult for seniors to have to live without public transportation . 
Nursing home life is a miserable and very expensive way to die . 
And owning a car is becoming more expensive . 
This country has made walking for daily errands or taking a bus or train impractical for any but inner city commuters residents . 
The private automobile is one of the factors behind the trillions spent in foreign wars . 
The biggest public transportation subsidies are being eaten by the automakers and it is the most inefficient way to move people . 
And all of the above to be held hostage by the cost of gas . 
Very stupid and not at all worth it . 
There 's a mistake in the last paragraph . 
I meant to write `` that European cities look like they are being constructed around public transportation lines '' In other words : most of the world had more sense . 
And I want to add , that for decades European countries put a very high tax on gasoline . 
I do n't know for sure , but I think most countries except the ME , have taxed gasoline heavily . 
If analysts totaled all the costs of extensive road and highway networks , purchase price and repair bills , gasoline costs , taxes and insurance costs , prison time and lost productivity for DUI and other auto related legal issues , a system that is so ubiquitous it is n't possible in most suburban areas to walk to a convenient store to get a few groceries , and then the costs of fighting in expensive conflicts that masquerade as `` freedom fighting '' to ensure that it can control in same way the costs of oil , the automobile is probably the single biggest waste of money and time ever invented . 
Paintcan -- took a while -- but -- spot on !! seems our society neve gets to the `` bones '' of a problem . 
I look up and see the sun -- literally -- burning -- at no cost to anyone -- burning -- day after day , after day , after day ... Guess it is more fun to create sophisticated weapons to drain blood , limb and life from the body of anyone who dares to stand in the path leading to highly polluting , highly profitable , cheap -LRB- ? -RRB- 
Thanks nyman , Solar energy is n't as practical for the northern hemisphere but geo-thermal potential is far more prevalent . 
The states west of Kansas from Mexico to Canada are all potential sites . 
The plants are models of simplicity without carbon emissions or toxic waste . 
It seems the only difficulty is drilling deep enough with a large enough diameter pipe . 
But fossil fuels need not be outlawed as fuels . 
Some places would always need it . 
Many places and developing countries could and are developing other power sources . 
You can find maps online charting global geothermal potential . 
But it 's easy to tell why Qaddafi was a tyrant with off than on again and than off again popularity . 
Libya had enormous cash reserves and the largest oil deposits in Africa . 
This country and Europe both need cheap oil and will get it and control it any way they can . 
The rest is a matter of propagandizing their countries into accepting the new political reality . 
It will be easy to get consensus . 
All the powers that be have to do , is raise the price at the pumps and the countries will fall over themselves to get to even more benighted brethren who ` need out help '' . 
Any country with massive mineral wealth is a potential target for the new global concern . 
And we will all learn to accept the new morality or else . 
We just have to rescue the Saudi 's the UAE from their ruling dynasts .

2011-08-23,"WASHINGTON | Tue Aug 23 , 2011 11:33 pm BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rich in oil but without a properly functioning state , a post-Gaddafi Libya faces major political and economic challenges as it tries to rebuild after four decades of despotic rule . 
A transitional council of Libyan rebels has already tried to roughly outline rebuilding plans , using a Power Point presentation for stabilizing a country while it is in the final throes of a violent transition . 
Diplomats who have seen the rough plan say the rebel Transitional National Council knows it must move swiftly to meet expectations of the masses of people who have provided the support and manpower to oust Muammar Gaddafi after 42 years . 
Among the TNC 's biggest concerns is that the United States and others will be too slow in unfreezing billions of dollars of Gaddafi 's assets , leading to a complete breakdown of basic services , Western and Middle East diplomats told Reuters . 
One option under consideration was for the transitional council to seek temporary bridge financing from the World Bank and other global institutions until political decisions are made to return all of its assets , the officials said . 
Even as fierce fighting persists in Tripoli , diplomats and financiers are accelerating plans to help Libyans rebuild once Gaddafi 's regime is ended . 
The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it was seeking to release between $ 1 billion -LRB- 605.7 million pounds -RRB- and $ 1.5 billion of frozen Libyan government assets to the rebels within days if it can secure the blessing of the United Nations sanctions committee . 
The money would come from the roughly $ 32 billion in assets that the United States froze earlier this year , only about one-tenth of which , or $ 3 billion , is liquid . 
Diplomats said until the assets were unfrozen and all of the $ 32 billion is released , Libya would likely be under tight budget constraints , a risk for any new government seeking legitimacy . 
The TNC has said it will meet officials from the United States , France , Italy , Britain , Turkey and Qatar in Doha on Wednesday to seek international funds to help Libya recover from the war . 
U.S. APPEARS TO WANT ONLY SUPPORTING ROLE The next phase of planning for post-conflict Libya would occur in Istanbul on Thursday , where senior diplomats from nations of the Libya Contact Group will gather , said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland . 
It appears the United States wants to play , at best , a supporting role in post-war Libya , working through the United Nations and global financial institutions like the World Bank . 
Libya 's problems are unique because , after four decades of Gaddafi 's personalized rule , it does not have a regular state structure and therefore it is difficult for institutions like the World bank to know whether or not they are dealing with official representatives of Libya . 
In addition , because of its oil wealth , Libya is considered a middle-income country and therefore is not eligible for some of the direct aid that poorer nations might qualify for through development institutions . 
`` It is going to be a challenge , '' said Marwan Muasher , a former foreign minister and deputy prime minister of Jordan , now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington . 
`` There were no functioning institutions of the state to start with so you 're almost starting from scratch anyway , '' said Muasher , a former World Bank official QUICK COLLAPSE EVOKES IRAQ 'S 2003 DEFEAT The quick collapse of Gaddafi 's authority has inevitably evoked comparisons to the rapid U.S. military victory in Iraq in 2003 , which was followed by looting , chaos and civil war . 
But a former senior U.S. diplomat with extensive experience in the Middle East said , `` Libya , on the face of it , ought to be a simpler case '' than Iraq . 
While acknowledging poor management of some state services , the former diplomat said the existence of a senior managerial class made Libya `` much more encouraging in that respect than the Baghdad of 2003 and those people need to feel like they have a stake , immediately , in the revival of their nation . '' 
More than 30 countries have recognized the rebels ' TNC as the legitimate government of Libya , although it has not officially been acknowledged by international lenders like the International Monetary Fund . 
A Washington-based diplomat told Reuters that Libya would likely be discussed by the world 's leading economies of the Group of Eight at a September 9-10 meeting in France . 
It could also be taken up by the Group of 20 leading economies on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings later next month . 
The country 's assets in foreign currencies have reached about $ 168 billion and oil production could resume within the next 3 to 6 months , according to Libya 's former central bank governor . 
A sovereign wealth fund set up in 2006 to manage Libya 's oil revenues could also be pivotal for the country 's post-conflict transition , especially to rebuild broken infrastructure . 
Though somewhat depleted the Libyan Investment Authority still holds billions of dollars in cash and a number of lucrative equity stakes in Western blue-chip companies such as Pearson and Unicredit . 
There were attempts under Gaddafi to modernize the oil-based economy and government services by passing laws to attract new investment . 
But much of the effort was wasted and pressure will be on the new transitional council to show Libya can be more than just an oil revenue-dependent country .

2011-08-23,"LONDON | Tue Aug 23 , 2011 10:51 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The fortified Tripoli compound attacked by Libyan rebels Tuesday is the seat of Muammar Gaddafi 's political power and the principal base of loyalist fighters trying to rescue his 42-year-old rule . 
Analysts say Gaddafi loyalist fighters confronted with an influx of rebels since the weekend have sought to use his Bab al-Azizyah bastion as a springboard from which to carve out a loyalist zone and chip away at rebel control of adjoining neighborhoods . 
The encampment is believed to sit atop a network of tunnels and bunkers that lead to adjoining districts , including possibly a subterranean route to the coast . 
But the tunnel networks are not the loyalist militiamen 's only card : Gaddafi 's fighters have an intimate knowledge of the city and many are believed to have a greater degree of military training than their opposition guerrilla opponents . 
`` This is Gaddafi 's Pentagon , '' said Noman Benotman , a senior analyst at the British think tank Quilliam and a former Libyan Islamist opposition guerrilla commander . 
He said tunnels forking out from the complex to nearby districts gave his fighters precious access to supplies . 
`` Based in Bab al-Azizyah , Gaddafi 's force want to create chaos inside Tripoli and carve it up into rival militia zones , just like Beirut in the Lebanese civil war , '' said Benotman , who is also an associate of former Libyan spy chief Moussa Koussa `` By sending a message that ` there will be no peace without us ' his aim is to force his inclusion in talks on a political negotiation . '' 
Long the seat of Gaddafi 's power as well as his main Tripoli home , the barracks may well be the final battleground of Libya 's war . 
Even if Gaddafi is not there , its loss would inflict a potentially crippling symbolic defeat . 
If Gaddafi is at the six sq-km -LRB- 2.3 sq mi -RRB- base , located south of Tripoli at the northern end of the Airport Highway , there is a fair chance he is in a tunnel under it rather than in a fortified room above ground . 
The compound has often been targeted by NATO air strikes , but it is still defended by tanks and snipers , a fact that suggests Gaddafi or at least some key aides are nearby . 
Al Arabiya news channel said rebel forces had attacked the gates of the compound Tuesday as NATO warplanes flew low overhead . 
Sky Television said smoke could be seen billowing from the compound following a NATO attack . 
COMPOUND WALLS CAN BE BREACHED `` FROM THE AIR '' The site is normally dotted with tents , residential buildings , security encampments , and the cratered remains of a house bombed by U.S. warplanes in 1986 and kept in ruins as a memorial . 
A communications center , attacked months ago by NATO , sits on an adjoining plot . 
Umar al-Hariri , a military official of the rebel Libyan National Transitional Council , told Al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper in June that the barracks were linked to underground tunnels up to 30 km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- long , some of which led to the sea . 
Hariri said that for rebel fighters attacking the compound it was just as important for NATO to breach the meter-thick , olive-green walls as to access the tunnels underneath . 
`` I met NATO at one time and told them that the most important thing they should strike are the walls of Bab al-Aziziyah because their thickness is one meter and they can not be penetrated by a tank or gun . 
There must be a penetration from the air , '' he was quoted as saying . 
He put the height of the walls at four meters . 
Built in the era of King Idris , overthrown by Gaddafi in the 1969 putsch that brought him to power , the site was reinforced in the 1980s using an array of foreign contractors . 
Analysts say Western intelligence services will have long ago sought to question any foreign companies that helped build tunnels under the site , to learn how to attack the compound . 
From a rebel and Western perspective , that information is growing more valuable by the hour . 
Jon Marks , chairman of Britain 's Cross Border Information risk consultancy and information service , said he suspected Western governments will have asked foreign companies that helped Gaddafi build his Great Man Made River project for any information about the tunnels under Tripoli , on the assumption some may have helped build them . 
The Man Made River project sends water from wells in the Sahara desert to coastal communities along a 4,000 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- - long network of pipelines . 
`` The governments will be asking the companies for a debrief , '' he said , adding the Tripoli tunnels `` may have been done as a side order from the Man Made River work . ''

2011-08-23,"CARACAS | Tue Aug 23 , 2011 5:10 pm EDT CARACAS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Tuesday he will only recognize a Libyan government led by his friend and ally Muammar Gaddafi and accused the United States of inciting the country 's civil war . 
Chavez , who has been the most vocal world leader to support Gaddafi , accused Western powers of riding roughshod over international law by backing Libya 's rebels in their revolt . 
`` This is kicking , spitting ... on the most basic elements of international law , '' he said . 
`` Where are the international rights ? 
This is like the caveman era . '' 
Venezuela 's socialist leader spoke after rebels overran Gaddafi 's compound in Tripoli in what appeared to be the end of his 42-year rule . 
During six months of civil war more than 30 countries , including the United States and major European Union countries , have moved to recognize the rebel National Transitional Council as the governing authority in Libya . 
`` Now -LRB- U.S. President Barack -RRB- Obama said he will collaborate economically with the new government , which of course we do not recognize , '' Chavez said . 
`` We only recognize one government , the one led by Muammar Gaddafi , '' he said to applause as he presided over a cabinet meeting broadcast live on state TV . 
The 57-year-old former soldier has repeatedly accused Western powers of fuelling the conflict to steal Libya 's oil and on Tuesday said they were waging a `` dogs ' war . '' 
`` It 's harsh but true ... They arranged this war , '' Chavez said , referring to the United States . 
`` They provided the arms , the mercenaries . 
They better not attempt to apply the Libyan formula to Venezuela or we 'll have to show them our power . '' 
Both Chavez and Gaddafi are military men who cast themselves as anti-imperialist revolutionaries and forged a friendship during half a dozen encounters in the past decade . 
They have enjoyed a long-standing alliance based on left-wing economic ideas , antagonistic relations with the United States , and their countries ' membership in OPEC . 
Chavez studied Gaddafi 's `` Green Book '' outlining his political philosophy while in the army , and both men have given each other numerous gifts and awards . 
Back in March , the Venezuelan leader proposed a vague peace plan for Libya that received little support from either side . 
Some media reports have suggested Gaddafi , whose whereabouts remain unknown , could seek asylum in Venezuela but Chavez made no reference to that .

2011-08-24,"\* Continued fighting in Tripoli blocks inflow of aid \* Dire shortages of food , water , blood for medical care \* Libyan hospital staff overwhelmed GENEVA , Aug 24 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Conditions in Tripoli 's hospitals could become catastrophic without a rapid improvement in security in the Libyan capital , the emergency coordinator of aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- told Reuters on Wednesday . 
Medical supplies ran low during six months of civil war but have almost completely dried up in the siege and battle of the past week . 
Fuel supplies have run out and the few remaining medical workers are struggling to get to work . 
`` The situation is very tough and the movement is very restricted . 
The situation in medical structures at the moment is not good , it 's almost a catastrophe , '' MSF 's Rosa Crestani said . 
`` There are clearly shortages of life-saving medication and equipment . 
There are no antibiotics and instruments for life-saving surgery . '' 
Crestani , who is based in Brussels but in close contact with MSF staff on the ground in Libya , said the most urgent cases included not just those wounded in the fighting , but also civilians such as women needing caesarian sections . 
Hospital staff are overwhelmed and exhausted , she said . 
Muftah Etwilb , a spokesman for the International Federation of the Red Cross in Benghazi , said he had spoken to the director of Tripoli Central Hospital who said he was appealing for his staff to come to work despite the security situation . 
Restricted movement across the capital has exacerbated supply problems , Etwilb said , with Tripoli Central likely to run out of oxygen stocks within two or three days . 
A rebel spokesman said all of Tripoli 's health facilities were suffering from shortages and urged doctors to return to work . 
`` There is a real catastrophe here , '' he said . 
`` Appeals were made yesterday in the streets and mosques for urgent help . 
There is also a dangerous shortage of blood at hospitals for the wounded ... and a shortage of foodstuffs . 
Drinking water is completely unavailable in some areas in Tripoli . '' 
Crestani said the items needed included dressing materials , external fixators for treating fractures , anaesthetics , antibiotics and tetanus vaccine , but also drugs for chronic diseases such as diabetes , hypertension and cancer . 
Many cancer drugs had been out of stock for weeks or even months , Crestani said . 
The shortage of fuel and electricity has also crippled hospitals ' ability to keep health services running . 
`` It 's a big problem to run ambulances and also some hospitals have been running on generators for the past few days and are really at the end of their capacity . 
This is really a major problem . '' 
MSF is just one of many international agencies ready to help Tripoli cope with the aftermath of the fighting . 
But it 's still not clear whether the `` aftermath '' has arrived . 
The European Union said on Wednesday it had been preparing for months and was `` geared up for the humanitarian challenge '' , with an initial focus on war surgery and helping hospitals . 
`` We have prepositioned humanitarian stocks in the accessible zones of Libya and have coordinated all efforts with our humanitarian partners . 
We are ready , '' Kristalina Georgieva , European Commissioner for International Cooperation , Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response , said in a statement . 
The Commission has allocated 80 million euros to respond to the Libyan conflict , including 10 million for assistance once Tripoli and the coastal cities opened up for delivery of relief . 
The Commission was in a position to deliver aid swiftly and efficiently , it said , without saying when this would start . 
Crestani said MSF teams were on their way from Tunisia and she hoped to give the green light to deploy to Tripoli as soon as possible , and in a few days in the worst case . 
`` I really hope that it 's not weeks because that will be a real catastrophe . '' 
Even in the best case scenario , it will take months to restore normality to the health care system , she said .

2011-08-24,"Intense gun battles as rebel fighters take Muammar Gaddafi 's compound in central Tripoli on Tuesday . 
It appears the man who has ruled Libya for four decades has little or no power left . 
Foreign oil companies with stakes in Libya are intensely interested in who or what will replace him , and how quickly stability can return . 
Libya 's National Transitional Council is the political face of anti-Gaddafi forces . 
Ahmed Jehani is its senior representative for reconstruction . 
In an interview with Reuters Insider TV Jehani said foreign oil companies will still be able to do business in Libya under arrangements made before the fall of Gaddafi 's regime . 
SOUNDBITE : AHMED JEHANI , SENIOR REBEL REPRESENTATIVE FOR RECONSTRUCTION , SAYING -LRB- English -RRB- : `` All contracts will be honored . 
All lawful contracts will be offered , whether they are in the oil and gas complex or in the contracting . 
At the moment it is not for this government to decide whether they will be revoking any contract . '' 
It may not be that easy . 
Before the civil war ignited six months ago Libya exported 1.6 million barrels of oil a day . 
That output has fallen to almost nothing . 
Although oil infrastructure could be quickly repaired divisions between the rebels and Libya 's numerous tribal , regional and ethnic groups will be more difficult . 
Shashank Joshi is an international security expert with Royal United Services in London . 
SHASHANK JOSHI , ASSOCIATE FELLOW , ROYAL UNITED SERVICES , SAYING -LRB- English -RRB- : `` I think though , those divisions which are ineradicable in the short term can be contained without resort to violence as long as the new government is really focused on tolerance and inclusiveness . 
It says it is . 
I think the test will come when it has to make difficult choices like how to divide Libya 's oil wealth or where , for example , to start disarming militias . '' 
Jehani says bringing stability is the National Transitional Council 's primary aim . 
SOUNDBITE : AHMED JAHANI , SENIOR REBEL REPRESENTATIVE FOR RECONSTRUCTION , SAYING -LRB- English -RRB- : `` Right now we are focused like a laser on stabilisation . 
How you stabalise security , the services to your people , humanitarian , you get the governance right , you get the economy right , all of these things you need to do and focus on them , then you move into rehabilitation . ''

2011-08-24,"UNITED NATIONS | Wed Aug 24 , 2011 6:37 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States on Wednesday asked the U.N. Security Council to unfreeze $ 1.5 billion in Libyan assets , a proposal South African has blocked for weeks because it objects to funding the rebel government . 
The U.S. delegation submitted a draft resolution to the 15-nation body asking it to make the money available for civilian and humanitarian purposes `` as soon as possible . '' 
No vote was held on the draft on Wednesday , but diplomats said a vote could come on Thursday or Friday . 
The U.S. move to ask the Security Council to make a decision on a matter that would normally be handled by the council 's Libya sanctions committee came out of frustration with South Africa , which has refused to consent to the idea of handing over large sums directly to Libya 's rebel leaders . 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier that the Obama administration wanted to free up funds to provide humanitarian assistance and support to the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- , the rebel government , which controls of most of Libya now thanks to recent gains by rebel fighters . 
The U.S. draft resolution says the money , currently frozen by the U.S. government on the basis of U.N. sanctions adopted earlier this year , was not to be used for military purposes . 
`` None of the funds made available pursuant to this resolution will be provided for the purchase of arms , non-lethal military equipment or any other military-related activity , '' the draft text said . 
Of the $ 1.5 billion , $ 500 million would go to international humanitarian organizations directly , a proposal the South African delegation says it does not object to . 
Diplomats say the South Africans , however , have problems with the U.S. proposal to hand another $ 1.0 billion to `` third-party vendors supplying fuel and other urgently needed humanitarian goods '' and to what the resolution describes as an `` international mechanism '' for providing social services . 
The South African objections , diplomats say , have prevented the sanctions committee from approving the U.S. request to release the funds , first submitted to the committee on August 8 . 
The resolution says fuel from `` third-party vendors '' would not be used for military purposes and that the council would have `` written assurances '' to that effect from the rebel TNC . 
Several council diplomats told Reuters privately that they were uncomfortable with parts of the U.S. proposal . 
They said South Africa was not alone in its reservations about handing funds over to the rebels , although it is the only country formally blocking the U.S. request on the sanctions committee . 
Russia and others have concerns about unfreezing funds for the TNC , they said . 
South African Ambassador Baso Sangqu told reporters his country was concerned that funding the TNC implied recognizing it , something the African Union had not so far done . 
Pretoria was awaiting the outcome of an AU meeting on the issue on Thursday before deciding whether to lift its objections , he said . 
U.N. sanctions committees work on the basis of consensus , which means all 15 Security Council members -- including South Africa -- have a virtual veto . 
By presenting a resolution to the council , the United States was preparing to bypass the sanctions committee and the need for consensus on its request . 
Council resolutions need nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the five permanent council members -- the United States , China , France , Britain and Russia -- to pass . 
If the objections to the U.S. request are lifted in the sanctions committee , there will be no need to vote on the resolution submitted by the U.S. delegation . 
If the objections remain , Washington will demand a vote , envoys say . 
The United States alone has frozen some $ 37 billion in Libyan assets , U.S. officials say . 
The Security Council imposed sanctions in response to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's brutal crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators earlier this year . 
The protests led to a civil war and U.N. approval for NATO intervention . 
The request for the urgent unfreezing of $ 1.5 billion of sanctioned Libyan assets is separate from the longer-term discussions that will be taking place in Paris , Doha and New York about postwar planning for Libya , including the release of tens of billions of dollars of frozen Libyan funds .

2011-08-24,"LONDON Aug 24 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi 's foreign minister was quoted on Wednesday as saying Libya 's civil war was virtually over and urged Gaddafi loyalists to stop fighting . 
Asked in an interview with Britain 's Channel 4 News if the conflict was finished , Abdelati Obeidi said : `` Yes , this is my feeling . '' 
`` If I am in charge , I would tell them to lay down their arms , '' he said , referring to fighters loyal to Muammar Gaddafi . 
Asked if he knew where Gaddafi was , he said : `` No. . 
No. '' Obeidi was talking via telephone from a house in Tripoli , Channel 4 said . 
He said he was not in touch with many other government ministers but did not fear for his safety and hinted he might be able to play some role in the future of Libya . 
He did not indicate whether he had quit his role in government .

`` I am sure they will not harm me or my family . 
On the contrary , I feel when things are quiet we can speak to each other . '' 
Last month , Obeidi visited Moscow seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict which would involve all Libyans . 
On Wednesday , he said a negotiated settlement was highly unlikely . 
`` It looks that , you know , things have passed this kind of solution , '' he said . 
`` What I am worried about is law and order and the stability of the people . 
I hope those people -LRB- rebels -RRB- are all Libyans and they are not foreign - they are not occupiers - and people in our country try to mend these injuries and go over this crisis and start their responsibilities . 
They are responsible for the country . ''

2011-08-25,"TRIPOLI | Thu Aug 25 , 2011 6:56 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi taunted his Libyan enemies and their Western backers as rebel forces battled pockets of loyalists across Tripoli in an ever more urgent quest to find and silence the fugitive strongman . 
Rumors of Gaddafi or his sons being cornered , even sighted , swirled among excitable rebel fighters engaged in heavy machinegun and rocket exchanges . 
But two days after his compound was overrun , hopes of a swift end to six months of war were still being frustrated by fierce rearguard actions . 
Western powers demanded Gaddafi 's surrender and worked to release frozen Libyan state funds , hoping to ease hardships and start reconstruction in the oil-rich state . 
But with loyalists holding out in the capital , in Gaddafi 's coastal home city and deep in the inland desert , violence could go on for some time , testing the ability of the government-in-waiting to keep order . 
`` The tribes ... must march on Tripoli , '' Gaddafi said in an audio message broadcast on a sympathetic TV channel . 
`` Do not leave Tripoli to those rats , kill them , defeat them quickly . 
`` The enemy is delusional , NATO is retreating , '' he shouted , sounding firmer and clearer than in a similar speech released on Wednesday . 
Though his enemies believe Gaddafi , 69 , is still in the capital , they fear he could flee by long-prepared escape routes , using tunnels and bunkers , to rally an insurgency . 
Diehards numbering perhaps in the hundreds were keeping at bay squads of irregular , anti-Gaddafi fighters who had swept into the capital on Sunday and who were now rushing from one site to another , firing assault rifles , machineguns and anti-aircraft cannon bolted to the backs of pick-up trucks . 
In a southern district close to the notorious prison of Abu Salim , the rebel forces launched a concerted assault , sweeping from house to house and taking prisoners . 
Elsewhere , pro-Gaddafi forces shelled rebel positions at Tripoli 's airport , and NATO warplanes bombed Sirte to the east -- Gaddafi 's birthplace . 
While random gunfire broke out periodically across the city , some of its two million residents ventured out to stock up on supplies for the first time in days . 
Aid agencies sounded an alarm about food , water and also medical supplies , especially for hundreds of wounded . 
But the new leadership said it had found huge stockpiles in Tripoli which would ease the shortages . 
In a sign that Libya 's rebel authority was gradually taking over the levers of power from Gaddafi , National Transitional Council official Ali Tarhouni said late on Thursday the body had begun a planned move from the eastern rebel bastion of Benghazi to Tripoli . 
`` I proclaim the beginning of the resumption of the work of the executive office in Tripoli , '' Tarhouni , who is in charge of oil and financial matters for the council , told reporters at a briefing in the capital . 
The shift is seen as a crucial step to smoothing over rifts in the country , fragmented by regional and tribal divisions , particularly between east and west . 
Nonetheless , in order to begin installing an administration in a nation run by an eccentric personality cult for 42 years , to offer jobs to young men now bearing arms and to heal ethnic , tribal and other divisions that have been exacerbated by civil war , Libya 's new masters are anxious for hard cash quickly . 
The United States and South Africa struck a deal late on Thursday to allow the release of $ 1.5 billion in frozen Libya funds for humanitarian aid and other civilian needs , U.N. diplomats said . 
Some governments , notably in Africa where there was some sympathy for Gaddafi 's view of his Western enemies as colonialist aggressors , had been reluctant to agree to the deal . 
After a meeting of officials in Istanbul , the Contact Group of allies against Gaddafi called on Libyans to avoid revenge . 
`` The participants attached utmost importance to the realization of national reconciliation in Libya , '' it said . 
`` They agreed that such a process should be based on principles of inclusiveness , avoidance of retribution and vengeance . '' 
The group also urged the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution freeing up cash quickly . 
Jibril said the uprising , the bloodiest so far of the Arab Spring , could fall apart if funds were not forthcoming quickly : `` The biggest destabilizing element would be the failure ... to deliver the necessary services and pay the salaries of the people who have not been paid for months . 
`` Our priorities can not be carried out by the government without having the necessary money immediately , '' he said . 
Gaddafi 's opponents fear that he may rally an insurgency , as did Saddam Hussein in Iraq , should he remain at large and , perhaps , in control of funds salted away for such a purpose . 
Western powers , mindful of the bloodshed in Iraq , have made clear they do not want to engage their troops in Libya . 
But a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Washington would look favorably on any Libyan request for U.N. police assistance -- something some say might aid a transition to democracy . 
Rebel leaders , offering a million-dollar reward , say the war will be over only when Gaddafi is found , `` dead or alive . '' 
The ex-international high representative in Bosnia , Paddy Ashdown , told Reuters there was a need for speed if Libya 's new rulers were to avoid a lingering threat from their predecessor , unlike what transpired in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq . 
`` The best time to capture these defeated leaders is immediately after the conflict finishes , '' Ashdown said . 
`` The longer it takes the more chance they have of being spirited away to a place which is much more difficult to find . '' 
The United States and NATO are also deeply concerned about possible looting and resale of weapons from Libyan arsenals as Muammar Gaddafi 's rule crumbles , though the U.S. State Department said it believes Libya 's stocks of concentrated uranium and mustard agent are secure . 
With fighting raging in Tripoli , there was evidence of the kind of bitter bloodletting in recent days that the rebel leaders are anxious to stop in the interests of uniting Libyans , including former Gaddafi supporters , in a democracy . 
A Reuters correspondent counted 30 bodies , apparently of troops and gunmen who had fought for Gaddafi , at a site in central Tripoli . 
At least two had their hands bound . 
One was strapped to a hospital trolley with a drip still in his arm . 
All the bodies had been riddled with bullets . 
Elsewhere , a British medical worker said she had counted 17 bodies who she believed were of prisoners executed by Gaddafi 's forces . 
One wounded man said he had survived the incident , when , he said , prison guards had sprayed inmates with gunfire on Tuesday as the rebel forces entered Gaddafi 's compound . 
French magazine Paris Match quoted an intelligence source saying Libyan commandos found evidence that he had stayed at a safe house which they raided on Wednesday . 
NATO was helping the rebels with intelligence and reconnaissance , Britain said , and its jets kept up their bombing campaign overnight . 
`` There are areas of resistance by the regime which has had considerable levels of military expertise , still has stockpiles of weapons and still has the ability for command and control , '' said British Defense Minister Liam Fox . 
`` They may take some time to completely eliminate and it is likely there will be some frustrating days ahead before the Libyan people are completely free of the Gaddafi legacy . '' 
Nonetheless , many in Tripoli count themselves happy already that Gaddafi has gone . 
`` I was nine years old when Gaddafi came to power and I 've always hoped I would n't die before I saw this day , '' said Ali Salem al-Gharyani , choking back tears . 
`` I am now 50 years old and this is the first time , seeing Gaddafi gone , that I have experienced true joy in my life . ''

MAY 23 : EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton yesterday opened a mission office in the rebel capital of Benghazi , hours after Nato bombed Tripoli port and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi s compound . 
We are here for the long term , So how comes last weekend the mass media report that rebels took over the ` compound '' while we know was `` bombed '' in may 23 ... . 
Of course the the victory is for those countries holding the `` frozen billions '' that are to be released for the reconstruction of Libya ... As is happening in Iraq . 
20billions dollars bill only on air conditioning the US troops . 
The Libya `` war '' is a war wagged by NATO and the country infrastructure has been destroyed by NATO bombs , not by automatic ` rifle '' and small rockets . 
Thanks for the opportunity of sending this comment .

2011-08-25,"The opinions expressed are his own . 
With the press focused on scenes of joy in Tripoli and Benghazi , continued skirmishes with regime loyalists , and speculation about where Gaddafi might turn up , it is time to lift our sights and focus on the really difficult transition ahead . 
If another autocrat succeeds Gaddafi , the transition could be over soon . 
But if Libya embarks on an effort to create a more democratic state , unified and inclusive in many dimensions , we ll need to wait the better part of a decade to know whether it has succeeded or not . 
There are no magic formulas for how to go about this . 
Each contingency has its own requirements . 
We have seen many more partial failures than full successes : think Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Certainly in Libya security will be job one . 
The immediate goal is public order , so that people can move freely without fear of large-scale violence . 
But there was public order of a non-democratic sort in Gaddafi s Libya . 
What the rebels have done in areas liberated in recent months is as clever as it is remarkable : they have organized local councils to try to ensure security and other immediate requirements . 
This does not always happen in civil wars but it suggests a way forward . 
There were at least four councils in Tripoli before Gaddafi fell . 
Can they step in to organize local communities to protect themselves from the inevitable aftershocks of Gaddafi s fall ? 
Even if that works , it is only a temporary expedient . 
Libya will need a retrained and re-oriented police force , one that seeks to serve and protect rather than intimidate and repress . 
International assistance in this regard has become the rule rather than the exception , but there is little unused international capacity , because of Afghanistan , Kosovo and other requirements . 
It is tempting to suggest that Arab countries take on this task , but difficult to imagine that they will do it in a way that encourages the kind of community policing that is needed . 
Even training and retraining 1,000 per year , it will take at least the better part of a decade to put in place a police force Libyan democracy would want . 
Even well-trained police are no use if there are no courts where the people they arrest can be fairly tried and sentenced , as well as prisons to put them in . 
Courts require not only judges but also prosecutors and defense attorneys , not to mention court recorders , registrars and bailiffs . 
If the formal court system fails to provide fair and rapid justice , Libyans will turn to informal methods of dispute resolution , especially where tribal structures are strong in the countryside . 
There is nothing inherently wrong with that , but there are difficult issues to be resolved concerning the interaction between tribal and formal justice systems , and the treatment of women in tribal systems . 
The justice system is an important part of the state , especially in post-war situations , but it is not the only thing that needs fixing . 
Libya has only rudimentary state institutions apart from the oil ministry . 
There is no constitution . 
All power lay in the hands of Gaddafi and his family . 
So there will be a need to build the state almost from the ground up . 
There may be advantages in this , as there will be less to sweep away . 
The Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- that has led the rebellion has published a good , relatively liberal and democratic constitutional charter . 
But the TNC needs to reformulate itself to be more representative of parts of the country that have been liberated only recently , including Tripoli . 
And its capability to implement its good intentions is not yet clear . 
The TNC would like to prepare a new constitution within six months and hold elections within a year to help establish democratic legitimacy . 
The problem with this idea is that a democratic environment and culture can not be created in such a short time frame , which favors those with an existing organizational infrastructure like Islamists -LRB- who will use the mosques -RRB- and disfavors those with shallower roots in Libyan society , like secularists . 
This tension is still being played out in Egypt . 
It might also be wise to consider holding local elections first , since they produce results more immediately reflective of citizens needs and provide a test of both the electoral mechanism and political outcomes . 
But in the end Libyans will need to decide . 
I will not be surprised if the one-year time frame gets extended to two , and the real outcomes are not apparent until the second elections , presumably four years later . 
All this requires money . 
Libya s economy is essentially 100 per cent dependent on oil and gas . 
It will take time to get production back up to pre-war levels . 
In the meanwhile , the TNC will need access to the frozen assets of the Gaddafi regime . 
This is not a simple matter . 
In many countries , including the United States , it requires not only a decision of the president but also a presentation to the sanctions committee of the United Nations . 
There are ample funds well over $ 30 billion are frozen in the United States alone . 
But getting them to the TNC , and ensuring that they are spent accountably and transparently will not be easy . 
There are few well established oil and gas producing states that have managed that trick . 
The people of Libya in the meanwhile are living in dreadful conditions . 
Food , water , health care and electricity are lacking , especially in vulnerable populations like the poor and displaced . 
The TNC needs somehow to begin to deliver goods and services , especially in the major cities . 
Libyans will be celebrating for a few days , but then they are going to start to wonder how they are better off . 
That is a question that will persist even once immediate needs are satisfied . 
Ten years from now Libyans will be discussing whether justice has been done to those who committed crimes under the Gaddafi regime , and whether the traumas of that regime and the civil war have been healed . 
All these decade-long challenges will require an alert and informed Libyan citizenry . 
The activism and energy that they have shown in resisting the Gaddafi regime needs to be continued and channeled into the development of civil society organizations that can mediate between the citizens and their new state . 
Hundreds of such organizations have already emerged in Benghazi and other liberated areas . 
More will emerge in Tripoli . 
They are vital to keeping a democratic transition on track . 
The international role in all of this is still unclear . 
The United States is trying to limit its burdens . 
It has too much to do elsewhere and no truly vital national interests at stake in Libya , even if it might have some specific interests in preventing Libya from becoming a source of arms trafficking and a haven for international terrorists . 
European interests are more compelling : oil and gas , related investments , and the desire to prevent migration from Libya becoming an issue in European domestic politics . 
The Arab League and its members also have an interest in seeing Libya back on its feet as soon as possible . 
The international community , which so far has based its efforts on UN Security Council resolution 1973 , needs a clear set of goals and a reasonable division of labor to guide it in the future . 
Getting Libya right in the post-war decade is going to require a lot of European and Arab support , and the Americans need to be ready to pitch in where they have unique capabilities .

Full Article Libya rebel official aims for oil export in 2-3 months TRIPOLI | Fri Aug 26 , 2011 4:41 am IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Libyan rebel government hopes to restart oil exports within two to three months and reach full volumes in about a year , Ali Tarhouni , the official in charge of financial and oil matters told Reuters from Libya 's oil ministry in Tripoli . 
It was the first time an official from the rebel National Transitional Authority was seen in the capital taking up the reins of government , after rebel fighters swept into the city four days ago aiming to topple Muammar Gaddafi . 
`` The NOC -LRB- National Oil Corporation -RRB- initial estimate is that we can have about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels within two to three months . 
And then we ramp this up to the normal , which is about 1.6 -LRB- million -RRB- . 
My expectation is that this will be done within a year or so , '' Tarhouni said . 
Damage on most of Libya 's oilfields from the civil war has been minimal , he said . 
`` The state of the oil fields are a lot better than expected , '' he said . 
`` Overall if we want to put a number on it , the average is about 10 percent or so . 
Most of the fields are more than 90 percent fine . '' 
He added that Libya would continue to honor existing contracts with oil companies . 
Asked if there would be any block for companies from countries that had not supported the rebels , he responded : `` Not that I know of . '' 
`` We have contracts with most of the major companies . 
Wintershall , Shell , Repsol , Eni . 
We have n't signed any new contracts . 
These are pre-revolution contracts . 
We are going to continue those '' . 
He also said it was too early to discuss awarding any new contracts : `` It 's the last thing on my mind . '' 
`` We 're just going to put back things as they used to be . 
The NOC is the one that is practically running the oil industry . 
We will restructure that to make sure that it 's nimble . '' 
Asked who will be running the oil industry for the foreseeable future until a general election , Tarhouni said : `` I 'm in charge until they decide to use somebody else . '' 
Tarhouni , formerly a U.S.-based academic and opposition figure in exile , returned to take charge of economic , financial and oil matters on the rebels ' executive committee .

LONDON | Fri Aug 26 , 2011 4:18 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil prices are likely to stay above $ 100 a barrel next year despite increasing downward pressure from the expected return of some Libyan production and fears of a double-dip recession , a Reuters poll showed . 
According to 29 analysts polled by Reuters , Brent crude prices will average $ 107.90 a barrel in 2012 , down from the forecast of $ 109.30 a barrel in last month 's poll . 
U.S. light crude oil , also known as West Texas Intermediate -LRB- WTI -RRB- , will average $ 96.30 a barrel next year , down from a forecast of $ 99.40 a barrel last month . 
Despite doubts about how fast Libyan oil production could restart as fighting between rebels and loyalists to Muammar Gaddafi continues in Tripoli , analysts are beginning to account for some output in the medium term . 
`` The possible comeback of Libya as oil exporter after half a year of civil war will lead to even more oil supply , '' LBBW analyst Frank Schallenberger said . 
`` On the other hand , the slowing down of the global economy will limit demand . '' 
A flurry of poor economic data from the United States and Europe in the past week has already led to a sharp correction in risk assets . 
In the short-term the market will focus on a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday for hints of more quantitative easing , but U.S. investment bank Citigroup -LRB- C. N -RRB- noted this week that even if the United States printed more money , weak economic growth and fresh supplies from Libya would weigh on prices . 
`` If crude prices have been retreating in August , it was not because of positive expectations on the restart of crude oil exports from Libya but on negative expectations about oil demand , '' Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix said in a note . 
Brent crude futures were trading above $ 110 a barrel on Friday morning . 
`` Growth expectations are likely to be in focus , and Bernanke 's much anticipated speech is likely to play a pivotal role for near-term price direction across all asset classes , '' said Gain Capital Forex.com analyst Daniel Hwang . 
The previous round of quantitative easing announced a year ago has led to a sharp boost in commodity prices but has failed to revive growth of the world 's largest economy . 
In the euro zone , the latest data from economic powerhouse Germany showed a steep drop in business confidence and worries about the fiscal troubles ripping through the common currency area . 
`` The month of August has seen one of the most dramatic turnarounds in the outlook for the global economy in living memory . 
Continued political squabbling , combined with poor historical economic data released around the turn of the month , led to a dramatic collapse in financial market sentiment , with many risk assets experiencing the largest falls since the period immediately following the collapse of Lehman in September 2008 , '' Credit Suisse analysts said . 
Analyst Davide Tabarelli from Nomisma Energy expected oil prices to shed a political risk premium gained on the back of the Libyan conflict . 
`` Prices increased by $ 20 because of Libya ; now they should fall by at least that portion , '' Tabarelli said , adding it could take around three months to bring production in line with previous levels . 
But Tabarelli was in the minority . 
Four out of five analysts in the Reuters poll still saw 2012 Brent prices above $ 100 . 
`` With the resumption of supplies from Libya , the oil price could come under pressure in the coming months , though it is unlikely to fall below $ 100 per barrel for long , '' Commerzbank analysts said in a note . 
The fall in prices should also help tighten the gap between Brent and U.S. light crude prices to an average of $ 11.60 per barrel in 2012 from around $ 24.90 a barrel currently . 
Despite an expected correction of feedstock prices , Petromatrix 's Jakob warned that product prices remained at high levels that are hampering demand , and the trickle of downward revisions to oil demand projections was underway . 
The latest available data from MasterCard showed U.S. retail gasoline demand fell last week despite a drop in pump prices , in what analysts warned had been a difficult driving season .

2011-08-26,"TRIPOLI | Fri Aug 26 , 2011 6:23 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels claimed to be close to capturing Muammar Gaddafi on Friday as their NATO backers bombed diehard loyalists in his tribal bastion , but there was no sign of an end to the war , or to international wrangling over Libya 's riches . 
Leaders of the National Transitional Council , which has Western support , pressed foreign governments to release Libyan funds frozen abroad , warning of its urgent need to impose order and provide services to a population traumatized by six months of conflict and 42 years of eccentric , personal rule . 
But Gaddafi 's long-time allies in Africa , beneficiaries of his oil-fueled largesse and sympathizers with a foreign policy he called anti-colonial , offered the fugitive strongman a grain of comfort and irked the rebels by refusing to follow Arab and Western powers in recognizing the NTC as the legal government . 
Combined with the reluctance of major powers like China , Russia and Brazil , to see Europeans and Americans dominate a nation with Africa 's biggest oil reserves , the African Union 's resistance may slow the pace at which funds are released . 
Mahmoud Jibril , head of the government in waiting , said time was short . 
Visiting NATO member Turkey , he said : `` We have to establish an army , strong police force to be able meet the needs of the people and we need capital and we need the assets . 
`` All our friends in the international community speak of stability and security . 
We need that too . '' 
While many African states have recognized the NTC , the AU would not do so as long as fighting continued , South African President Jacob Zuma , a vocal advocate for Gaddafi , said after a meeting in Addis Ababa at which the AU called for all sides in the conflict to negotiate a peace and work for democracy . 
`` If there is fighting , there is fighting , '' Zuma said . 
`` The process is fluid . 
That 's part of what we inform countries -- whether there is an authority to recognize . '' 
Rebel leaders are determined to show they are in charge , though estimates vary of when the TNC will move formally from its Benghazi base in the east to the war zone that is Tripoli . 
`` We have come to operate the country . 
We are now the legal authority , '' declared Mohammed al-Alagi , a lawyer who has been the TNC 's justice minister for some months , as he met foreign journalists in the capital wearing a rebel flag as a bandana . 
Other TNC leaders , who stress they want to work with other rebel groups which sprang up later in the west as well with those who have previously supported Gaddafi , say the war will only be over once the fallen leader is caught , `` dead or alive . '' 
Alagi voiced confidence that Gaddafi and his entourage of sons and aides was surrounded and would soon be captured : `` The area where he is now is under siege , '' he told Reuters , while declining to say where in Tripoli he thought Gaddafi was . 
`` The rebels are monitoring the area and they are dealing with it . '' 
Similar confidence has proved misplaced since the irregular armies overran Gaddafi 's compound on Tuesday , however , and analysts do not rule out that the 69-year-old , a veteran master of surprise , might have slipped away to rally supporters for an insurgency . 
He has not been seen in public for two months , but made a defiant audio broadcast on Thursday . 
Colonel Hisham Buhagiar of the rebel force in the capital said Libyan commandos were targeting several areas : `` We are sending special forces every day to hunt down Gaddafi . 
We have one unit that does intelligence and other units that hunt him . '' 
NATO forces , notably from France and Britain , are helping the rebels . 
Many analysts assume they are giving intelligence and may have their own special forces troops on the ground . 
Despite sporadic gunfire as rebel fighters tried to take pockets of loyalist resistance , Tripoli was quieter than in recent days . 
Dead bodies , the stench of rotting garbage in the oppressive summer heat , wrecked cars and the other detritus of war were evidence of frantic battles and wildly erratic firing . 
Some of Tripoli 's two million people , suffering from power cuts , dwindling supplies and a critical shortage of medical supplies and healthcare , ventured out to local mosques , some praying Gaddafi can be found by Monday , when Muslims mark the end of the fasting month of Ramadan with the festival of Eid . 
`` Gaddafi is the biggest criminal and dictator and we hope we will find him before the end of Ramadan , '' said Milad Abu Aisha , a 60-year-old pensioner who joined friends at his local mosque for traditional worship on the last Friday of Ramadan . 
`` It will be the happiest Eid in 42 years , '' said Mohammed al-Misrati , a 52-year-old office worker who was among hundreds streaming toward the mosque under the protection of armed local men who have formed ad hoc security units across the capital . 
`` We have a taste of freedom after 42 years of repression . '' 
British aircraft fired cruise missiles at a headquarters bunker overnight in Gaddafi 's birthplace of Sirte . 
A city beyond rebel control , on the Mediterranean coast 450 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , some believe he might seek refuge there among his tribesmen . 
Loyalist forces also still hold positions deep in the Sahara desert . 
`` Sirte remains an operating base from which pro-Gaddafi troops project hostile forces against Misrata and Tripoli , '' a NATO official said , adding that its forces had also acted to stop a column of 29 vehicles heading west toward Misrata . 
In Benghazi , rebel military spokesman Ahmed Bani said the bombing in Sirte was aimed at ammunition stores and depots for Scud missiles . 
`` Maybe the mercenaries will run away , '' he said , referring to suggestions Gaddafi 's forces include hired fighters from Chad and other sub-Saharan African countries . 
`` After this bombing , maybe the people there will try to rise up . '' 
he added , saying TNC commanders were also in contact with tribal chiefs in Sirte , hoping to avoid bloodshed . 
Such negotiations will be a major challenge across the country for Libya 's new rulers as they try to meet expectations of young men now bearing arms and to heal ethnic , tribal and other divisions that have been exacerbated by civil war .

2011-08-28,"TRIPOLI | Sun Aug 28 , 2011 7:37 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebel forces were converging on Muammar Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte on Monday , hoping to deliver the coup de grace of their revolution but uncertain if the fallen strongman was holed up there . 
The fugitive Gaddafi 's exact whereabouts where still not known and it was possible he was still in hiding in Tripoli , five days after it fell to rebel forces and his 42-year-old reign collapsed . 
NATO war planes struck at Sirte , on the Mediterranean coast , for a third day on Sunday , a spokesman for the multi-national alliance said in Brussels . 
`` We 're paying close attention to what 's happening in Sirte because we know that there are remnants of the regime that are there , '' the spokesman said . 
On the ground , rebel forces also closed in and said they would seize Sirte by force if negotiations for its surrender failed . 
Gaddafi was born near Sirte , 450 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , in 1942 and after he seized power in 1969 he built it up from a sleepy fishing village into an important city and power center of 100,000 people . 
He still retains support and sympathy there , so whether or not he has chosen to retreat to the city to make a last stand , its capture will still be strategically and symbolically important to the rebels as they consolidate their victory . 
One rebel commander said his forces were within 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- of Sirte from the east and others were advancing from the west . 
On the coastal highway east of Tripoli , tank transporters were carrying Soviet-designed T-55 tanks in the direction of Sirte . 
Rebels said the tanks were seized from an abandoned military base in Zlitan . 
Jamal Tunally , a rebel military commander in Misrata , told Reuters : `` The front line is 30 km from Sirte . 
We think the Sirte situation will be resolved peacefully , God willing . '' 
`` Now we just need to find Gaddafi . 
I think he is still hiding underneath Bab al-Aziziyah like a rat , '' said Tunally , referring to Gaddafi 's compound in Tripoli which rebels overran on Tuesday . 
In the east , rebel fighters pushed 7 km -LRB- 4 miles -RRB- past the village of Bin Jawad and secured the Nawfaliyah junction , a rebel spokesman said . 
`` We 're going slowly , '' spokesman Mohammad Zawawi told Reuters . 
`` We want to give more time for negotiations , to give a chance for those people trying to persuade the people inside Sirte to surrender and open their city . '' 
In Tripoli , the rebel leadership sought to establish control after days of confusion and sporadic skirmishing with the remnants of Gaddafi 's forces . 
Several explosions and intermittent gunfire were heard overnight Sunday . 
The stench of rotting bodies and burning garbage still hung over the city and food , water and other supplies were running short , indications that despite the euphoria of victory , plenty of challenges lay ahead . 
Gaddafi , 69 , is on the run and the fear among his foes is that he intends to lead an insurgency against them . 
NTC officials rejected any idea of talks with him , saying he was a criminal who must be brought to justice . 
`` We did not negotiate when we were weak , and we wo n't negotiate now that we have liberated all of Libya , '' NTC information minister Mahmoud Shammam told a news conference . 
The Associated Press earlier quoted Gaddafi 's spokesman , Moussa Ibrahim , as saying Gaddafi was still in Libya and wanted to discuss forming a transitional government with the NTC . 
NTC officials say Gaddafi , his son Saif al-Islam and his spy chief should be tried in Libya , although they are wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity . 
The NTC and its Western backers are acutely aware of the need to prevent Libya collapsing into the kind of chaos that plagued Iraq for years after the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 . 
The de facto government , whose leaders plan to move to Tripoli from Benghazi this week , is trying to impose security , restore basic services and revive the energy -- based economy . 
But in the aftermath of victory , many corpses have been found , some of slain Gaddafi soldiers , others the victims of killings in cold blood . 
A Libyan official said 75 bodies had been found at the Abu Salim hospital , which was caught up in heavy fighting , and another 35 corpses were found at the Yurmuk hospital . 
The possibility that rebel fighters executed captured Gaddafi soldiers would pose an image problem for the NTC . 
Rebel military spokesman Colonel Ahmed Bani said there was concern for the fate of 40,000 prisoners who he said had been detained by Gaddafi 's forces and who were still unaccounted for . 
It was possible some were being held in underground bunkers in Tripoli that rebels had been unable to locate . 
In good omens for economic recovery , officials said a vital gas export pipeline to Europe had been repaired and Libya 's biggest refinery had survived the war intact . 
In the west , Tunisian authorities reopened the main border crossing into Libya , restoring a supply route for Tripoli , after Gaddafi forces were driven out on Friday . 
That should help relieve a looming humanitarian crisis in the city , where food , drinking water and medicines are scarce . 
Trucks loaded with food and other goods were already moving across the Ras Jdir crossing toward Tripoli , about two hours ' drive away . 
Tripoli residents queued for bread or scoured grocery shops for food . 
Many took a stoical view of their plight . 
`` This is a tax we pay for our freedom , '' said Sanusi Idhan , a layer waiting to buy food . 
The NTC issued messages urging electricity workers to get back to work and efforts to pay the salaries of public sector workers were underway .

The group was banned internationally as a terrorist organization following the 9\/11\/01 terrorists attacks on the U.S. Today the group is known as the Libyan Islamic Movement . 
The LIGF had numerous ties to al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden . 
-LRB- you can find the complete article -RRB- Now you get the picture of who the `` rebels '' really are and what they are after ... . 
Media habitually tells us that Libyan rebels are noble freedom fighters , struggling aganist a bloodthirsty tyrant . 
But after all the buckets of half-truths and blatant lies , that news poured on our heads , treating us viewers like brainless sheep and feeding us half-baked reports that often got disproved the next day , some of us started to look further and investigate . 
What they found out , is extremely disturbing . 
Say , from the very beginning of war we 've been hearing reports about `` Gaddafi 's black mercenaries '' . 
We even saw photos and videos of several people that , supposedly , were these mercenaries . 
But the whole truth is much more complicated -- and scary . 
Yes , there indeed are several divisions of black Africans and citizens of Chad in the army of Libya , that is formed on the principle of territorial militia . 
But they can hardly be considered mercenaries -- not more than French Foreign Legion or non-American citizens in US Army . 
In general , the status of black men of Libyan army 's various units is civil servants . 
In a country with 6 million inhabitants , one third are black -LRB- the most oppressed group in the country -RRB- . 
Would not it be easier for the rebels to call for their solidarity and ask them join the rebel ranks ? 
But not only black Libyans do not join the rebellion -- they flee in terror . 
The first wave of reports and evidence of beatings of black Africans began in February and March . 
The rebels , under the trademark of fighting with the mercenaries from Chad , were slaughtering all black people with no mercy . 
Back in early March , the Human Rights Watch even warned black migrant workers on the need to flee the revolutionary terrain . 
`` We left behind our friends from Chad . 
We left behind their bodies . 
We had 70 or 80 people from Chad working for our company . 
They cut them dead with pruning shears and axes , attacking them , saying you 're providing troops for Gaddafi . 
The Sudanese , the Chadians were massacred . 
We saw it ourselves . 
I am a worker , not a fighter . 
They took me from my house and -LRB- raped -RRB- my wife '' , -- a Turkish oilfield worker , who fled Libya , told BBC in February 25 . 
One of the editors of the Monthly Review , Yoshie Furuhashi , writes : `` The black African workers now live in fear in the territories held by the rebels in Libya . 
Some have been attacked by mobs , some have been imprisoned and some of their houses and shops have been torched . 
Many African workers say they felt safer under the regime of Gaddafi '' . 
In March , a reporter from the Daily Mail was in Benghazi and reported : `` Africans I saw ranged from a 20 year old and a late forties , with a grizzled beard . 
Most wore casual clothes . 
When they realized that I spoke English erupted in protests . 
`` We did nothing , '' one told me , before he was silenced . 
`` We are all construction workers in Ghana . 
Do not harm anyone . '' 
Another accused , a man in green overalls , showed the paint on their sleeves and said : `` This is my job . 
I do not know how to shoot a gun '' Abdul Nasser , 47 , protested : `` They lie about us . 
They took us out of our house at night when we were asleep . '' 
While still complaining , they were taken . 
International Business Times published an article on March 2 that says : `` According to reports , over 150 black Africans at least a dozen different countries escaped from Libya by plane and landed at the airport in Nairobi , Kenya , with horrific stories of violence . '' 
`` We were attacked by locals who said they were mercenaries who killed people . 
I mean blacks who refused to see `` Julius told Reuters Kiluu , a construction supervisor for 60 years . 
Michel Collon with a fact-finding delegation were in Libya in July and when he learned what had happened , he said : `` I met these people during my research in Tripoli . 
I could talk to some people . 
They were not `` mercenaries , '' as the rebels and the media tell . 
Some were dark-skinned Libyans -LRB- much of the population is of African type , in fact -RRB- , others were black civilians from African countries who stayed in Libya for a long time . 
All support Gaddafi precisely because he opposes to racism and treats them as Arabs and Africans on an equal footing . 
On the contrary , the rebels in Benghazi are known for their racism , and blacks were victims of terrible systematic atrocities . 
The paradox is that NATO wants to bring democracy to a section of Al Qaeda and Libyan Ku Klux Klan-type racists '' . 
Twitter explodes with rebels ' messages about killing `` African mercenaries '' . 
In the chaos of embattled Tripoli , black people are being simply seized from the streets and taken somewhere openly . 
On the photo above we can see that the dead people 's hands are tied with plastic handcuffs and their clothes are relatively clean . 
This means these people were captured not after a fight , but deliberately . 
The Colonel was being building good relations with the south of Africa . 
NATO plan of destabilizing Libya might as well include having the black Africans turning away from this country forever , using contempt and xenophobia of the rebels as a driving force of the persecution . 
After all , lynching black people simply for being in Africa sounds ridiculous . 
But results are pretty much of the same racist kind , and they are not funny at all . 
@invictuss , by characterizing one person in a movement of perhaps millions with links to AL-Qaeda , you are not proving the whole movement is bad . 
That is assuming you are even correct . 
That would be like saying all Americans are Al-Qaeda sympathizers just because one American citizen is a member , and there are many . 
Back to point of article , so far it has been mostly good news out of Libya in last week , let us hope this trend continues and the Libyans can form a solid , democratic government of their own doing . 
It is not our place , Western Powers , to dictate but to guide .

2011-08-28,"Libya plans to ship crude from Tobruk by end of September BENGHAZI , Libya | Sun Aug 28 , 2011 2:36 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya plans to restart production at two eastern oil fields in mid-September and resume shipping oil from Tobruk by the end of the same month , offering relief to European countries reliant on its imports . 
Oil production in the OPEC country has been at a virtual stand-still for months as clashes between rebels and troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi have damaged infrastructure and caused foreign workers to flee . 
This has forced global economies to pay more than $ 100 a barrel for Brent crude since the civil war began in February and driven up import costs for major buyers like Italy , Germany and France . 
`` Operations will start on September 15 and by the end of the month we will have the capability to export from Tobruk , '' Abdeljalil Mayuf , spokesman for Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- told Reuters , referring to the Sarir and Mesla fields deep in the Libyan desert . 
He said technical teams would be sent out to the fields after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends , in the first week of September . 
Initial production will be at around 60,000-100 ,000 barrels per day and any further increase would depend on the condition of underground wells , he said . 
Some of this oil will be used to feed AGOCO refineries in east Libya once they restart , he said . 
The oilfields in eastern Libya were damaged by troops loyal to Gaddafi during the country 's civil war , killing 14 oil workers . 
The damage has now been repaired , AGOCO said , while rebel officials say they have set up a special security force to protect oil infrastructure from saboteurs . 
Around 80 percent of Libyan oil fields are in the east of the country around the Sirte basin , with rebel fighters now in control of the key oil ports of Brega and Ras Lanuf . 
AGOCO has a total production capacity of around 420,000 barrels per day , or around a quarter of the country 's total output before the war began . 
Mayuf did not say if former supply contracts negotiated before the war would be respected . 
`` This will be arranged with the marketing department . 
There are many clients to choose from . ''

2011-08-29,"BENGHAZI | Mon Aug 29 , 2011 7:23 am EDT BENGHAZI Aug 29 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The chief executive of Italian oil firm Eni was in eastern Libya on Monday to meet with members of the rebel government , a spokesman for Libya 's rebel transitional government said . 
Paolo Scaroni is the first oil chief to visit the war-torn country since rebels took the capital Tripoli , in a move widely seen as an effort to secure Eni 's stake in Libya , which has Africa 's biggest oil reserves . 
`` He is in Benghazi and meeting with the head of the National Oil Company . 
They are discussing Eni 's interests in Libya , '' National Transition Council spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told Reuters . 
Eni was the largest foreign oil producer in the North African country before the civil war and is keen to mend relations with rebel leaders after hesitant Italian support for the uprising in its early stages . 
The firm is expected to offer emergency fuel supplies to Libya in an effort to help rebels consolidate their control . 
A western diplomatic source told Reuters that payment for the fuel would come out of the $ 8 billion of Libyan assets that Italy froze as part of sanctions against Muammar Gaddafi , whose 42-year rule appears to have come to an end . 
Oil traders said Eni was seeking to book a tanker for arrival in Libya this week .

2011-08-29,"JERUSALEM -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Palestinians in Gaza have acquired anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets from Libya during its six-month civil war , enlarging but not significantly improving their arsenal , Israeli officials said on Monday . 
While the rebellion against Muammar Gaddafi has stirred concern abroad about the fate of Libya 's aging chemical weapons stockpiles , Israel has no indication Hamas or other Palestinian factions have sought these , the officials said . 
Instead , Israeli officials have detected an inflow of SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles and rocket-propelled grenades -LRB- RPGs -RRB- , said one official , describing an overland supply route that opened up between eastern Libya -- after it fell to the rebels -- and the Gaza Strip via Egypt . 
`` We 've been seeing more SA-7s and RPGs coming across , '' said the official . 
`` It 's not a major qualitative enhancement for them . '' 
The Soviet-designed SA-7 is a shoulder-fired , heat-seeking missile which Israel said Palestinians had previously smuggled into Gaza . 
Rocket-propelled grenades -LRB- RPGs -RRB- , designed to penetrate armor , are plentiful in the territory . 
Another Israeli official said `` thousands '' of the weapons had reached Gaza in recent months , but did not provide figures on how many had originated in Libya . 
Egypt 's Sinai peninsula , which borders both Israel and Gaza , has long seen traffic in arms bound for Palestinians . 
The weapons come up through Sudan or arrive by ship over the Mediterranean . 
State television reported in Cairo on Monday that Egyptian border guards had discovered `` a large quantity '' of weapons at the border with Libya , giving no more details . 
Hamas , an Islamist group that governs Gaza , and smaller armed factions declined comment on the Israeli statements . 
Egypt has stepped up efforts to impose order in Sinai , though Cairo 's authority has been weakened by the citizen revolt that forced President Hosni Mubarak from power . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It would be a never ending battle of rockets and bombs against Israel but on a much wider scale . 
The US has no business in funding the PA or Hamas especially concerning the statements Abu Maven has made recently about never recognizing Israel . 
God bless Israel and it 's eternal undivided capital Jerusalem which all of us Christians support . 
No we do n't . 
Speak for yourself amos033 . 
The Palestinians will be much easier to deal -LRB- constructively -RRB- with than Al Queada . 
Looks like history is set to repeat . 
The palestinians do n't want peace , they want war .

2011-08-30,"Libya sees oil output at pre-war levels in 15 months BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue Aug 30 , 2011 11:43 am EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's oil production can restart within weeks and reach full pre-war output within 15 months , the newly-appointed chairman of the country 's National Oil Corporation -LRB- NOC -RRB- said on Tuesday . 
`` Starting up production will be within weeks , not months . 
After we start it will take less than 15 months -LRB- to reach full output -RRB- , '' Nouri Berouin , chairman of the NOC , told Reuters at the headquarters of Libya 's ruling interim government , the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , in Benghazi . 
The OPEC member was producing 1.6 million barrels per day before an uprising began in February against leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
The civil war caused foreign workers to flee and some oilfields and export terminals were damaged . 
Berouin said most oilfields were `` fine '' and had not suffered major damage but that minefields around the Brega export terminal could slow the resumption of normal operations . 
`` Once our fields are secure we need to make sure we clear the mines . 
Building up output will require logistical support and we might need our foreign partners , '' he said . 
NTC fighters moved into Tripoli earlier this month but clashes with forces loyal to Gaddafi continue near the major coastal oil terminals of Es-Sider and Ras Lanuf . 
Oil contracts signed with the Libyan NOC before the war when it was under the leadership of Shokri Ghanem will be respected , Berouin said . 
`` I have met with international oil companies and the first thing I told them was that we respect all contracts , '' he said .

2011-08-30,"-LRB- Adds further source , birthplace , comment -RRB- ALGIERS , Aug 30 -LRB- Reuters - Muammar Gaddafi became a grandfather again on Tuesday when his daughter Aisha gave birth to a girl within hours of fleeing across Libya 's desert border into Algeria , officials said . 
Algerian officials highlighted the plight of the expectant mother in explaining a decision to give refuge to the fugitive Libyan ex-leader 's wife and three of her children on Monday -- a move denounced by the country 's new rulers as an act of aggression . 
The child was born in Djanet , according to two Algerian official sources . 
An oasis deep in the Sahara , Djanet lies about 60 km -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- from the Libyan frontier and 500 km southwest of Sabha , one of the last bastions of support for Aisha Gaddafi 's 69-year-old father . 
`` Gaddafi 's daughter gave birth to a girl today , '' a source close to the Algerian health ministry , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told Reuters . 
`` This is all I can say . '' 
Aisha Gaddafi , a lawyer in her mid-30s about whom little information can be confirmed , was on the very point of giving birth when the family appealed to cross the border , another Algerian source said . 
That humanitarian consideration was the main reason for them being allowed in , the source added . 
Algeria 's ambassador to the United Nations , Mourad Benmehidi , told the BBC that in the desert regions there was a `` holy rule of hospitality . '' 
Analysts say the government in Algiers is wary of popular unrest in other Arab states and fears its own Islamist enemies may find support in the new Libya . 
However , a local newspaper in Algiers reported that Algeria would hand over Muammar Gaddafi to the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- if he himself entered the country . 
Another paper said part of the Libyan border would be closed . 
Gaddafi 's wife Safia and sons Hannibal and Mohammed were also in the party given refuge . 
Libya 's ruling council demanded them back for trial . 
But only Gaddafi himself , his son Saif al-Islam and a senior aide , who are both also in unaccounted for , are subject to an international arrest warrant for war crimes . 
Gaddafi 's only daughter who was not adopted , Aisha ran a charitable foundation and in 2004 joined a team of lawyers defending former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . 
There had been no public announcement that she was expecting a child . 
Aisha largely stayed out of Libyan politics , but since the start of a revolt against her father 's rule in February she appeared at pro-Gaddafi rallies and gave interviews in which she accused NATO of killing Libyan children . 
Quoting Algerian sources , the Echorouk newspaper said on its website that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika had told government ministers at a cabinet meeting on Monday Algeria would respect international law on all matters related to the Libyan conflict . 
`` Should Gaddafi try to enter Algerian soil ... Algeria would arrest him and hand him over to the International Criminal Court in compliance with international agreements , '' the newspaper said . 
It said the decision was not a reaction to the toppling of Gaddafi but was in accordance with the ICC 's arrest warrants . 
No one was immediately available from the government for comment . 
In a separate report , Echorouk said Gaddafi 's family would not be allowed to go to the capital Algiers . 
Algeria 's El Watan newspaper said the country was closing the southern part of its border with Libya . 
Quoting diplomatic sources , El Watan said an instruction had gone out to security services to close the southern part of the border with Libya because of the `` precarious situation '' there . 
Algeria 's border with Libya is hundreds of kilometers long and stretches through expanses of empty desert . 
Algerian officials say they are concerned that Islamist militants have infiltrated Libya 's National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- and that al Qaeda 's North African wing will exploit the chaos in Libya to acquire weapons and explosives . 
The NTC has denied those charges and in turn accuses Algeria of siding with Gaddafi during Libya 's civil war , something the Algerian authorities deny .

2011-08-30,"PARIS | Tue Aug 30 , 2011 12:51 pm EDT PARIS Aug 30 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - French oil group Total will be part of a mission of French companies heading to Libya next month to assess the situation , the head of the French-Libyan chamber of commerce said on Tuesday . 
Total was among the companies that during June and July visited the interim government 's stronghold in Benghazi to establish contacts with the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , with the backing of the French government . 
`` We 're not at the stage of signing contracts , but to understand how the NTC is managing this crisis and what urgent measures it needs to restart the oil machine that brings 95 percent of the country 's revenues so that it starts as quickly as possible , '' the chamber 's president , Michel Casals , told Reuters . 
The mission will include regional experts from other companies such as engineering firm Alstom , defense group EADS , state defense and electronics group Thales and telecom equipment maker Alcatel Lucent , as well as representatives of smaller companies that work with hospitals and in oil . 
Total , among the companies most likely to benefit from a resumption of business in Libya after a six-month civil war , declined to comment on the mission . 
It said it was monitoring the situation carefully to assess when its operations could restart in the country . 
The French Business Council -LRB- Medef International -RRB- and the chamber of commerce will host a conference in Paris on Sept. 6 for all French companies operating in Libya with the NTC and the French finance ministry to discuss the NTC 's projects , he said . 
Total is among the oil companies with the most significant investments in Libya , along with Britain 's BP and Russia 's Gazprom .

2011-08-30,"UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's interim leadership has rejected the idea of deploying any kind of international military force or observers , the U.N. special envoy on post-conflict planning for Libya said on Tuesday . 
`` We do n't now expect military observers to be requested by the -LRB- Libyan interim leadership -RRB- , '' envoy Ian Martin told reporters after attending a closed-door meeting of the U.N. Security Council . 
`` It 's very clear that the Libyans want to avoid any kind of military deployment of the U.N. or others , '' he said . 
Earlier on Tuesday Mustafa Abdel Jalil , chairman of the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , said that Libya did not need outside help to maintain security . 
Martin , however , said the United Nations expected that the NTC would ask it to help establish a police force . 
`` They are very seriously interested in assistance with policing to get the public security situation under control and gradually develop a democratically accountable public security force , '' Martin said . 
The Libyan civil war is not over yet . 
Although forces who fought for six months to depose former ruler Muammar Gaddafi now control most of the country , Gaddafi 's forces are holding out in a few Libyan towns , even though their leader has gone to ground and most of his family has fled the country .

2011-08-30,"CHICAGO | Tue Aug 30 , 2011 12:08 am EDT CHICAGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Forces loyal to fallen Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi committed a vast array of possible war crimes while battling rebels in Misrata , the country 's third largest city , according to a report issued on Tuesday by a U.S.-based human rights group . 
The report by Physicians for Human Rights , titled `` Witness to War Crimes : Evidence from Misrata , Libya , '' is based on interviews of residents in the Misrata area conducted in June . 
The authors say they provide evidence of `` murder , torture , rape , forced internment , and disappearance . '' 
The group says Libya 's National Transitional Council must now move to prosecute people suspected of committing those crimes . 
A popular uprising in Libya in February against Gaddafi 's 42-year-old rule resulted in a civil war with rebels backed by a NATO bombing campaign from the air starting in March . 
Misrata was liberated by rebels in May after a fierce three-month battle , and they now control most of the country . 
`` The abuses that we gathered evidence of in Misrata are some of the most egregious war crimes and crimes against humanity I 've heard of in Libya , '' said Richard Sollom , deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights and author of the report . 
`` There has been some evidence of crimes committed by rebel forces , but certainly nothing anywhere near as widespread and systematic as those committed by Gaddafi 's forces . '' 
A single act can be deemed a war crime , but when troops commit `` systematic and widespread '' crimes against civilians , that is a crime against humanity , Sollom said . 
As evidence of one such crime , the report includes a copy of a government order for troops to prevent fuel and supplies reaching the city of some 400,000 to 500,000 people . 
The crimes detailed in the report are also consistent with what residents told Reuters reporters in Misrata during the summer and with video evidence provide by a member of the new city council 's media committee . 
For the report , the group focused on Misrata plus two towns immediately to the south of the city -- Kerzaz and Tomina -- which Sollom said were used as bases for Gaddafi loyalists during the government 's bombardment of the city . 
People interviewed for the report cited cases of torture , summary executions and allegations that Gaddafi loyalists targeted civilians , hospitals and mosques . 
The report mentions the case of Mohammed , a civilian resident of the town of Kerzaz , who was left blind in one eye and suffered a broken jaw that he said he sustained while being tortured by government soldiers . 
Video footage provided to Reuters shows at least one apparent rocket attack on a hospital , in which a room full of incubators for premature infants was hit . 
Rebel fighters also showed a team of Reuters reporters in late July a mosque on Misrata 's western front in the town of Dafniya , which they said had been targeted by Gaddafi loyalists . 
There were holes caused by tank and rocket fire on the west side of the mosque 's minaret -- indicating that government troops had inflicted the damage . 
And in interviews residents of Misrata told Reuters in July that Gaddafi loyalists targeted civilians . 
`` Gaddafi 's aim here was to kill as many people as he had to in Misrata in order to stay in power , '' said Fauzi al-Karshaine , a local businessman who was shot five time by Gaddafi troops on February 19 during a protest for greater freedoms by unarmed people in Misrata . 
`` He does not care how many innocent women and children he has to kill to do it . '' 
In June the International Criminal Court issued indictments against Gaddafi , his son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam and Libyan intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi . 
Physicians for Human Rights recommends that to move forward , post-Gaddafi Libya must come to terms with its past and prosecute individuals suspected of having committed war crimes during the country 's internecine conflict . 
`` The -LRB- ruling rebel -RRB- National Transitional Council has been saying the right things about moving forward and prosecuting war crimes , '' Sollom said . 
`` But eventually Libya will have to deal with its past and hold individual perpetrators accountable . ''

2011-09-01,"MOSCOW | Thu Sep 1 , 2011 5:45 am EDT MOSCOW -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Russia recognized Libya 's ruling interim council as the country 's legitimate authority on Thursday , moving to increase its influence on postwar reconstruction and protect its economic interests in the oil-producing North African nation . 
`` The Russian Federation recognizes the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- as the current authorities , '' the Russian Foreign Ministry said on its website www.mid.ru . 
Russia , which was critical of NATO 's operation in Libya , announced its decision as leaders and envoys from world powers and international bodies gathered in Paris to coordinate Libya 's political and economic reconstruction . 
Moscow had billions of dollars worth of arms , energy and infrastructure deals with Libya under its deposed leader Muammar Gaddafi , and Russian officials have expressed concern they could be lost in the transition . 
`` We proceed from the position that all previously agreed treaties and other mutual obligations ... will be implemented in good faith , '' the Foreign Ministry said . 
Russia allowed Western military intervention in Libya to go ahead by abstaining from a U.N. Security Council resolution vote in March , but then repeatedly accused NATO forces carrying out air strikes of overstepping their mandate to protect civilians and of siding with anti-Gaddafi forces in the civil war . 
President Dmitry Medvedev , however , joined Western nations in urging Gaddafi to give up power and made clear he could not seek refuge in Russia . 
Nonetheless , some in Libya have signaled that the new authorities could slight nations like Russia and China in favor of those that gave more support to Gaddafi 's foes . 
Russia 's representative at the Paris talks , Medvedev 's special Africa envoy Mikhail Margelov , said he was confident that would not happen . 
`` I do n't think the new government of Libya will start off by evaluating contracts with Russia on political rather than technical and economic criteria , '' the Interfax news agency quoted Margelov as saying . 
Last week , Medvedev called for talks between Gaddafi 's backers and opponents , and suggested that Russia would recognize the NTC if it was able to `` unite the country for a new democratic start . '' 
The Foreign Ministry statement urged the council to carry out its `` declared reform program , which calls for the development of a new constitution , the holding of general elections and the formation of a government . '' 
Russia 's NATO envoy , Dmitry Rogozin , warned on Wednesday that unity among anti-Gaddafi forces would not last and said further Western military intervention was likely . 
`` As soon as the common enemy is defeated , the opposition will unavoidably meet with internal disagreements , '' Rogozin told Russia Today television . 
`` And I am certain that at that moment certain Western countries will try to provide themselves with a military presence in order to get control over Libya 's oil reserves . '' 
Russian companies Gazprom , Gazprom Neft and Tatneft have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in oil and gas exploration in Libya . 
State-run Russian Railways was building a high-speed railway from Sirte to Benghazi on Libya 's Mediterranean coast under a 2.2 billion euro -LRB- $ 3 billion -RRB- contract awarded during Gaddafi 's rule . 
"
2011-09-02,"TRIPOLI | Fri Sep 2 , 2011 7:02 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's new leadership reaffirmed its commitment to democracy on Friday and worked on its priorities for spending billions of dollars released from the frozen assets of fugitive strongman Muammar Gaddafi . 
A day after international powers met in Paris and agreed to hand over more than $ 15 billion to the rebels who overthrew Gaddafi the European Union rescinded a range of sanctions and officials from the National Transitional Council explained their rebuilding plans . 
The NTC representative in London said that work on putting right the damage of 42 years of eccentric one-man rule and of six months of civil war should not wait until Gaddafi is found and the last bastions of armed support for him are defeated . 
`` As long as Tripoli , the capital , is stabilized and secure and safe , which it almost is now , and the overwhelming majority of other cities and towns , then Libyans can get on with the process of transition and stabilization and the new political process , '' Guma El-Gamaty told the BBC . 
In the eastern city of Benghazi , seat of the uprising , an NTC official said the release of the funds meant the NTC now had to show Libyans it was capable of governing . 
`` Before we had the excuse that we did n't have money when things went wrong , '' he said . 
`` Now we do n't have the excuse . '' 
Gamaty reaffirmed the council 's commitment to a `` clear road map '' to democracy , including a constitution to be drafted within eight months , a referendum and then full elections in 2013 . 
`` By the end of about 20 months the Libyan people will have elected the leaders they want to lead their country , '' he said . 
As the rebels hunt Gaddafi , a spokesman for his son Saif al-Islam said he has been traveling around close to Tripoli , meeting tribal leaders and preparing to retake the capital . 
In a telephone call to Reuters in Tunisia from what he said was a `` southern suburb of Tripoli , '' Moussa Ibrahim derided the ability of the NTC to run the country and said their Western backers should negotiate with the ousted leader . 
There was no way to verify his comments which , like those broadcast this week by Gaddafi himself , serve as a public reminder to Libyans he remains at large and may pose a threat , at least by means of a guerrilla war , to the new authorities . 
Echoing comments made by Gaddafi and his son in recent broadcasts from hiding , Ibrahim said : `` Our army still controls many regions of Libya . 
We will be able to capture Tripoli back and many other cities in the near future . 
The fight is very , very far from over . 
Within even a few weeks , a few months , even a couple of years , we will have Libya back . '' 
In Tripoli , life was returning to normal . 
Municipal street sweepers picked up litter and spent bullet casings on Martyrs Square , known under Gaddafi as Green Square . 
NTC fighters had removed some roadblocks on a main road along the shoreline and more foodstores were open , although water supplies and power remained erratic . 
Several thousands of people , mainly women , later gathered in the square singing a new national anthem and carrying banners , which read `` For the first time we are free . '' 
NTC education chief Soliman el-Sahli told Reuters that schools would reopen on September 17 , despite some bombed-out classrooms , scarce transport and a curriculum until this year based on Gaddafi 's personal `` Green Book '' -- an eclectic account of the `` Brother Leader 's '' views of the world . 
One unknown in the process of installing an elected president and parliament is when the timetable will start running . 
The council road map says the process would begin once the NTC declares Libya `` liberated '' from Gaddafi . 
Its leaders have said the war will not end until he is found `` dead or alive '' so it is unclear when liberation might be achieved . 
On Thursday , the 42nd anniversary of the military coup which brought him to power as a 27-year-old army captain , Gaddafi , who is now 69 , declared his defiance in messages on satellite television . 
NTC commanders say they think he is hiding in the tribal bastion of Bani Walid , some 100 miles southeast of Tripoli . 
There are also suggestions he may be in his hometown of Sirte on the coast , or indeed elsewhere . 
`` Let it be a long battle . 
We will fight from place to place , from town to town , from valley to valley , from mountain to mountain , '' Gaddafi said in one message . 
In later comments he threatened urban warfare . 
NTC commanders say they are taking their time trying to cajole pro-Gaddafi holdouts like Bani Walid and Sirte into surrender in the interest of sparing further bloodshed . 
A Libyan from Bani Walid said he had been in sporadic contact this week with people in the city . 
`` I know that two months ago most of the family , the younger children , were staying in Bani Walid , '' said the source , who spoke on condition he was not identified . 
NATO said it had carried out air strikes on Thursday in the vicinity of Sirte and Bani Walid . 
In Libya 's third largest city Misrata , rebels said they were reinforcing security to intercept Gaddafi supporters trying to infiltrate the area from their haven in Sirte . 
`` There are Gaddafi scouts everywhere , '' said Ibrahim Obaid , a rebel fighter . 
The NTC 's reconstruction minister , Ahmad Jehani , and Aref Nayed , a member of the council 's rebuilding team , met experts in post-conflict rebuilding from groups including the International Monetary Fund , World Bank and USAID in Paris on Friday . 
U.S. and French officials said the meeting was mainly about listening to the council 's needs . 
The rebel officials said Libya is counting on quickly restoring oil production to revive its economy . 
Five foreign oil firms are already back and working to resume operations . 
`` The issue of damage is not much and you can get procurement very fast . 
This is helped by the fact the producing wells are under contract to international firms , if they feel they can deploy their people , '' Jehani said . 
Despite having access to some of the tens of billions of dollars Gaddafi had invested abroad , the new leaders will also need short-term aid and longer-term loans to help stave off a humanitarian crisis . 
In order for Libya 's new leaders to obtain aid from bodies such as the World Bank , they will need to be recognized by the IMF , which says such a move must be supported by its 187 members . 
Though dozens of countries have followed the Western powers in recognizing the NTC as Libya 's legitimate government , others have had qualms about the use of NATO force to oust Gaddafi . 
Many African and developing countries are still uneasy with a process that reminds some of the U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , even if Western leaders are at extreme pains to deny any plan to send in troops or run Libya for the Libyans . 
Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota of Brazil , which has not recognized the NTC said this month 's U.N. General Assembly would settle the matter of recognition . 
The European Union 's Official Journal listed 28 Libyan entities freed from EU sanctions as work gets under way to send in supplies and export oil through ports previously controlled by Gaddaf . 
EU foreign ministers meeting in Poland were to discuss how to help to stabilize Libya . 
European powers ended a long standoff with Gaddafi in recent years as he scaled back hostility in return for the development of oil and gas exports . 
Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Europe saw the new Libya as a major energy supplier and ally . 
`` Libya is potentially a wealthy country , key because of Europe 's drive to diversify energy sources . '' 
The huge numbers of weapons circulating in a postwar Libya with unsecured borders pose a risk to Europe and other nations , the European Union 's senior representative in Tripoli said . 
Agostino Miozzo , special representative of EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton , told Reuters the bloc wanted to see the NTC tackle the security problem by swiftly establishing control over its borders and reorganizing the armed forces .

2011-09-02,"SOPOT , Poland | Fri Sep 2 , 2011 10:32 am EDT SOPOT , Poland -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The European Union lifted sanctions on Libyan ports , oil firms and banks on Friday as foreign ministers met to discuss how to help the country 's transition from four decades of Muammar Gaddafi 's rule . 
The EU 's Official Journal listed 28 Libyan entities freed from restrictions , including the ports of Tripoli , Al Khoms , Brega , Ras Lanuf , Zawiya and Zuara . 
Also listed were Libyan Arab Airlines and energy firms including the Ras Lanuf Oil and Gas Processing Co. and the Sirte and Waha oil companies . 
Banks listed were the National Commercial Bank , Gumhouria Bank , Sahara Bank and First Gulf Libyan Bank . 
The formal lifting of the sanctions came a day after world powers meeting in Paris freed up billions of dollars to help Libya 's new rulers rebuild the nation after 42 years of Gaddafi 's rule and six months of civil war . 
European Union foreign ministers meeting in the Polish seaside resort of Sopot on Friday and Saturday were to discuss how to help to stabilize Libya after the conflict . 
Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said the United Nations would have a leading role in helping to demilitarize Libya and ensure safety after the conflict ends , but Europe had shown it has capabilities in this area . 
`` The way the EU will assist Libya depends firstly on what the Libyan authorities want , '' he told Reuters . 
`` We have a trust credit among the new authorities and we will want to use it to support peaceful transformation toward a democracy in Libya , '' he said , adding that oil-exporting North African state was a valuable ally for Europe . 
`` Libya is potentially a wealthy country , key because of Europe 's drive to diversify energy sources , '' he said . 
EU member states have been discussing the possibility of helping Libya with security sector reform and in police training . 
The transitional administration has called for help in reforming the judiciary reforms and improving governance . 
`` Everybody agrees this has to be a United Nations-led involvement , which is not likely to be of any military nature . 
The Libyans have said no to both military observers and any peacekeeping mission , '' said Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja . 
`` A police mission looks perhaps the likeliest possibility at the moment , '' he added . 
Earlier this week , NATO allies , most of whom are EU members , started mapping out ways the military alliance could support Libya 's ruling interim council in ensuring a peaceful transition . 
One option being discussed is for NATO to deploy forces to maintain an arms embargo in Libya , even after a no-fly zone mandated by the United Nations is lifted and hostilities cease . 
NATO has conducted an air campaign that includes enforcing the no-fly zone and a ban on weapons imports to Libya since late March to protect civilians during the civil war . 
In the Paris talks with Libya 's National Transitional Council , France , Britain and other powers vowed to keep up their military backing as long as needed , but said the focus was now on reconstruction . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Thursday a total of $ 15 billion would be freed out of the Libyan assets frozen under sanctions . 
The figure included $ 3 billion the U.N. Sanctions Committee has approved for release in the United States and Britain and 1.5 billion euros -LRB- $ 2.16 billion -RRB- in France . 
It also includes 2.6 billion euros of assets in Italy , a billion in Germany and 700 million euros in the Netherlands .

2011-09-04,"TAJOURA , Libya | Sun Sep 4 , 2011 10:47 am EDT TAJOURA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - When Muammar Gaddafi 's soldiers fled this corner of a field outside Tripoli where they were camped , they left behind their army fatigues , a can of Brut deodorant -- and a Scud tactical missile . 
Days later , the Soviet-made rocket , loaded on its launch truck and pointing toward the Libyan capital , is still sitting under the eucalyptus trees where they left it . 
The motley rebel forces who overthrew Gaddafi two weeks ago have set up no guard to prevent anyone taking it away or looting it for parts . 
Western powers and Libya 's neighbors fear that the power vacuum could allow huge quantities of unsecured weapons left over from the civil war to end up in the hands of Islamist militants , in particular the North African branch of al Qaeda . 
Officials with Libya 's interim government , the National Transitional Council , say they are trying to secure these weapons . 
But there was little evidence of that at the Scud site , in farmland about 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- southeast of Tripoli . 
Abdelhamid Omar Derbek , a colonel at the local anti-Gaddafi military headquarters , said he and his men visit the site several times a day . 
`` I patrol here ... and there is another shift that does it as well , '' said Derbek , who had a Kalashnikov rifle slung over his shoulder but whose military rank was not evident from his outfit of yellow Lacoste T-shirt , jeans and sandals . 
For all his assertions of supervision , however , Derbek is based at a military facility about 15 km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- away . 
He drove with a team of Reuters journalists from his camp to the site on Sunday but there was no one stationed there to guard it . 
A group of curious local people were looking around . 
`` I heard about it last night and I wanted to come and take a picture , '' said one of the visitors , who said he worked for an oil company . 
A Scud-launching complex , consisting of an 11-meter -LRB- 33-foot -RRB- rocket with a range of up to 300 km -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- depending on the variant , could be a valuable resource for any insurgent . 
Even without launching it , the warhead alone contains up to a tonne of high explosive , which could be stripped from the missile and used to make improvised bombs for urban guerrillas . 
`` The possibility is certainly there , '' said Shashank Joshi , a military expert at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute . 
`` Algeria has been terrified throughout this conflict of stocks like this , explosive devices , being taken out of Libya and used by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb . '' 
It is unlikely militants could steal the whole system and fire the missile . 
There was no sign at the site of any of the liquid fuel that propels the missile . 
This is stored separately because it is corrosive , and it has to be loaded into the missile before firing . 
`` It is not useful to a militant unless they have a source of liquid fuel nearby , '' said Joshi . 
Operating the missile also requires skilled technicians , he said , but it is theoretically possible that al Qaeda could find these . 
After the Red Army pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989 , mujahideen fighters -- some of whom later joined al Qaeda -- obtained stocks of Soviet Scuds and learned how to fire them . 
`` Clearly sometimes insurgent fighters can use Scud missiles , '' said Joshi . 
In an interview with Reuters on Friday , the senior European Union representative in Tripoli said the bloc was concerned that Islamist militants could obtain weapons in Libya and take them out across the country 's largely unpoliced borders . 
`` This is an evident risk , '' said EU envoy Agostino Miozzo . 
The NTC -- preoccupied with trying to catch Gaddafi , defeat his supporters in their remaining strongholds , and deal with shortages of fuel and water -- says securing the arms is a priority but not something that can be done straight away . 
`` Of course we are in a state of war , and Gaddafi definitely left some weapons and mines , '' General Omar Hariri , one of the interim government 's senior military commanders , told reporters in Tripoli last week . 
`` We have a group of military engineers who are specialized in finding out and digging out such weapons and such mines and it is only a matter of days before we are clearing all of these mines and gathering Gaddafi 's weapons , '' he said . 
`` We are still in a state of war so it 's very normal , it 's very natural . '' 
The Scud site is next to a highway leading east out of Tripoli and a short distance from a depot operated by U.S. oil services firm Schlumberger . 
It provided a glimpse of how Gaddafi 's forces had planned to use their military hardware for a last-ditch fight and then , when defeat became inevitable , hurriedly abandoned their posts . 
In total there were four mobile missile launchers parked within a radius of about 500 metres -LRB- yards -RRB- at the site . 
All the launchers had been covered to mask them from NATO warplanes -- they were draped in camouflage netting and parked under trees or sunk into trenches which local people said had been dug out by an excavator . 
Only one of the launchers had a missile mounted on it . 
It was not clear what had happened to the other rockets , though it appears they had not been used in the conflict . 
`` We do not know , '' said Abdelmounem Sabri , another colonel attached to the anti-Gaddafi military facility 15 km away . 
One of the launchers , without a missile on it , had been destroyed by a NATO air strike , leaving just a charred skeleton and scorching the eucalyptus tree it had been parked next to . 
Scattered in the sand around the launcher that was still loaded with a missile were about half a dozen anti-personnel mines , which appeared to have been dropped by the crew in their rush to leave . 
The canvas bags used to carry the mines were lying nearby . 
Colonel Derbek , giving a tour of the site , picked one of the mines up and nonchalantly waved it in the air . 
All of the intact Scud launchers seemed to be in working order . 
Dozens of cans of grease were thrown on the ground next to them , evidence that the crews had been keeping their mechanisms oiled and ready for action . 
At the armed launcher , the hydraulic control cables were plugged in to their sockets . 
The console that controls the stabilizer jacks on the launcher -- used to hold the unit steady for firing -- was attached by cables and sitting in the sand , ready to use . 
The crews had been living in a half-finished house a short distance away , most likely because they feared NATO strikes and did not want to camp right next to the Scud battery . 
At the house , there were more signs of a hasty departure . 
A traditional Arab water pipe was still primed with scented tobacco . 
On flimsy mattresses on the floor lay strewn razors , deodorant , toothbrushes and a pack of vitamin C tablets . 
Where the crews have gone , taking with them their expertise and , possibly , a grudge against Libya 's new rulers , is anyone 's guess . 
Five pairs of olive drab combat pants and six fatigue jackets lay at the site -- Gaddafi 's missile-men seemed to have changed into civilian clothes and melted into the population . 
We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Guess where the high-bidders -LRB- financed by the Iranians -RRB- are coming from , and where the missile is going to wind up ? 
Yup , along the borders of Israel . 
Qaddafi was a better deal ... What evidence do you have to support those claims ? 
Baseless conjecture and denigrating an entire movement , began out of desire for freedom , is abhorrent . 
And your idea of a `` better '' deal is to allow a ruthless dictator to oppress and murder his people rather than stand for democracy , freedom , and other rights you so callously take for granted and even have the gall to say other human beings are not entitled too ? 
It is quite a poor reflection of yourself when you would choose for innocent human beings to be subjected to tyranny instead of building a functional state , that can prevent future arms smuggling and -- more importantly -- serve the interests of its people . 
The arrogance and near-savagery of your comment is astounding . 
Autocracy over democracy , really ? 
And the `` better deal '' is the gauge of your interests over the Libyan people , who would face the consequence and not you . 
To those who can not , or will not learn from the past . 
Why do we not learn from the Iraq stock piles of wepons left ungraded , or not destroyed , these are turned into IED 'S . 
This has happened through out history . 
The wepons will be sold , and in that part of the world guess who would want them . 
There are many in africa alone . 
Afghanistan began as a desire for freedom . 
Arrogance is Archinosin inability , or refusal to learn from the past .

2011-09-04,"TRIPOLI | Sun Sep 4 , 2011 11:57 am EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The proliferation of weapons in Libya is a major concern and the new rulers need to establish a proper police force and army to replace the hundreds of armed groups who patrol the streets , the United Nations special adviser on Libya said on Sunday . 
Ian Martin , in Libya to compile a report for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on rebuilding the country after its civil war , also said the interim government needed to start the electoral process soon if it is to honor its commitment to establish democracy . 
The disintegration of Muammar Gaddafi 's rule after a six-month war has left a security vacuum in Libya , with no state security forces , rebel fighters who are not part of any formal structure and huge quantities of unsecured weapons . 
`` Proliferation of weapons is a major concern , '' Martin told Reuters in an interview on the second day of a visit to the Libyan capital . 
`` It 's a concern to Libya 's neighbors , quite naturally . 
The European Union was working on border security issues here in the past and I think it has made clear that it 's willing to assist Libya in future if asked to do so . '' 
`` Clearly it 's a matter of moving from the current situation in which there are many people with weapons who are fighting in this conflict to one where there is a single public security force and the kind of proper state army that did n't exist in Libya in the past , '' he said . 
`` I 've just been discussing with the Minister of the Interior the challenge that they face in terms of public security , in terms of getting police more fully back on the streets and weapons off the streets and building a democratically accountable police force . '' '' 
-LRB- That is -RRB- not an easy matter in any society , let alone one which is just coming out of 42 years of oppressive security and conflict . '' 
The National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , Libya 's de facto government since Gaddafi 's stronghold in the capital was overrun last month , says that it is in the process of integrating the armed rebel groups into the government . 
`` None of the groups is intent on staying as armed forces independent of the national army or the police and there is consensus on that , '' Aref El-Nayed , director of the NTC 's stabilization team , said earlier on Sunday . 
`` This process is already ongoing ... We are emerging with a unified structure . '' 
The NTC has committed itself to building a democratic system in Libya to replace Gaddafi 's authoritarian rule . 
It has set itself a timetable to establish a formal government and schedule elections . 
However , it has said that process will not get underway until `` national liberation '' -- without defining when or what that is . 
`` I think it is understandable that while there are still parts of the country that are not fully controlled by the new authorities , then they may not want to start the clock running on those commitments until they have the security throughout the country that would be necessary to carry them forward , '' said Martin . 
`` I do n't know exactly when that moment will be . '' 
`` The National Transitional Council has made strong commitments to proceed along a democratic path and has made clear it would like United Nations assistance in that area and although elections may be a little way ahead , that needs to begin soon to keep the commitment that they have made . '' 
He said there were no discussions with the new Libyan authorities about sending any kind of UN military or police force to help establish security . 
`` We 're not talking about a United Nations peacekeeping of any form here . 
We 're looking ahead to an essentially political , civilian mission with a number of advisory functions that could assist the authorities that they 've clearly identified . '' 
Martin said it was likely he would report on the situation in Libya to the UN Security Council at the end of next week . 
`` I certainly think that the commitments the leaders of the NTC are expressing to us are absolutely the right commitments . 
Of course they face a major challenge in implementing them in practice , and our commitment is to try to help them to do so , '' he said .

2011-09-04,"DJANET , Algeria | Sun Sep 4 , 2011 3:05 pm EDT DJANET , Algeria -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - She came with her mother and brothers , fleeing across the Sahara from the wrath of her father 's nation . 
Reaching a remote oasis , she gave birth to a daughter and was gone again , deep into the desert in a caravan of luxury vehicles . 
So goes the story of Aisha Gaddafi as told by Algerians living in the oasis town of Djanet , 1,500 km -LRB- 900 miles -RRB- inland from Algiers . 
They said they saw little of the ousted Libyan leader 's family during their two-day stay last week , but would welcome other supporters of Gaddafi who arrived as refugees . 
Like their prime minister , who said on Sunday that Algeria took pride in welcoming such `` humanitarian cases , '' locals in Djanet , 60 km -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- from the Libyan frontier post of Ghat , said traditions of hospitality among desert nomads meant the fugitive women and their accompanying menfolk were sure of a welcome , whatever crimes Muammar Gaddafi himself is wanted for . 
`` She was well treated and received all the medical care she needed in the hospital , '' said shopkeeper Sahraoui Safi , one of several of the town 's few thousand residents to recount fleeting glimpses of the Libyan convoy , with some dozen family members aboard , moving between the hospital and a tightly-guarded villa . 
A man named Mohand , who runs a coffee shop near the clinic , said he saw a convoy of Libyan cars heading to the hospital on Monday : `` I think Algeria has done the right thing , offering help and support to a refugee , '' he said . 
`` She is a refugee . '' 
Algerian officials said Gaddafi 's second wife Safia , along with her daughter Aisha and son Hannibal , as well as Mohammed , a son of Gaddafi by his first wife , crossed the border on Monday , August 29 . 
That Aisha , an international lawyer in her mid-30s , was about to give birth was a critical factor in letting them in . 
The child , a girl , was born almost immediately , in the early hours of Tuesday , at the Efiri clinic , a simple medical facility on the outskirts of Djanet . 
Aisha and her new baby spent a second night in the town , at a secluded house , but then left . 
A source in Algeria who was aware of arrangements for the Gaddafis but was not authorised to discuss them , told Reuters the family was now staying discreetly in the empty southeast of the country , probably in Illizi province , a territory the size of Italy with a population of only 50,000 . 
`` Aisha is still in the area , '' the source said . 
`` I believe she is in Illizi province . '' 
The family will not find in the desert the sort of luxury lifestyle that has been revealed in the past fortnight in their abandoned homes in Tripoli . 
Djanet has little to tempt the traveler . 
With midday summer temperatures hitting 50 degrees Celsius -LRB- 120 Fahrenheit -RRB- in the shade , dusty chairs and tables stand in nearly empty cafes . 
Historically a watering stop for camel trains crossing Africa 's great desert , it is now a scattering of flat-roofed brown houses among palm groves that creep up the boulder-strewn slopes of a low hill on which French colonial legionnaires built a small strongpoint , Fort Charlet , a century ago . 
While there was no shortage of friction between Algiers and Tripoli during the four-decades of Gaddafi 's rule -- including a dispute over the border near Djanet -- the two countries share a post-colonial suspicion of Western power which fostered a certain solidarity between Gaddafi and Algeria 's ruling elite . 
`` Libya , a brother nation , is a nation with an ancestral history , a neighbouring people with whom we share a glorious past and a radiant future , '' Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said in defending giving shelter to the Gaddafis -- a move Libya 's new rulers called an act of aggression . 
The government has ruled out taking in Gaddafi himself . 
Gaddafi 's whereabouts are not known , but one of his remaining bastions of support in Libya is Sabha , a 500 km -LRB- 300 mile -RRB- drive across the desert from Djanet . 
Algerian officials said Gaddafi called them and said he was in Ghadames , close to the border further north . 
Hundreds of Libyans from Sabha and as from as far away as Tripoli have come to Djanet and other villages in Illizi , residents said , adding that many were supporters of Gaddafi . 
They are keeping a low profile . 
When a Reuters reporter approached a group of people residents identified as visitors from Libya , they declined to speak . 
Algerians say they are trying to accommodate the incomers as best they can , despite their own limited means . 
The shopkeeper , Safi , said he had hosted a man he described as a cousin of Gaddafi in his home and sympathised with the plight of those fleeing their homeland . 
`` Some Libyans have lost everything overnight , it is a tragedy for most of them , '' he said . 
`` They never thought they would one day be refugees . '' 
Algeria has now closed the southern part of its border with Libya , according to a security source at the Debdeb crossing , near Ghadames . 
The source said hundreds of Libyans entered Algeria in the days before the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council put up its red , green and black flag on the Libyan frontier post . 
`` Now that the NTC controls the border , it is difficult for Gaddafi and his aides to get to Algeria , '' the source said . 
Algeria is the only one of Libya 's North African neighbors yet to recognize the NTC as Libya 's new authorities . 
It says it will do so once there is a representative government . 
Algerian officials say they are particularly concerned that Islamist militants have infiltrated the NTC and that al Qaeda 's North African wing will exploit the chaos in Libya to acquire weapons and explosives . 
However , many Algerians have criticised the government for failing to embrace the anti-Gaddafi movement in Libya . 
Algerians have followed the conflict closely , and many share the view of others in the Arab world that Gaddafi was a despot . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
The leader Aisha saw the death of his daughter Mastura , her brother Saif el Arab Gaddafi on the NATO bombing -LRB- 01-05-2011 -RRB- , his husband and love of her life Abu Ahmed Meniar and other compatriots . 
We admire their courage . 
Aisha is the leader of the Resistance , HOPE of the Libyan people . 
Aisha is an Arab woman , dignified , professional , highly qualified and fighter , great personality , Ambassador of Peace by the United Nations and consistent with Arab culture , participated in the defense of Hussein , whom was never proven that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction . 
The invasion of Iraq was also a slander to seize the oil wells . 
NATO members are oppressing the Libyan people FORCED into profitable contracts for transnational corporations of West . 
This theft of natural resources has had a high cost greater than the 50000 deaths Libyans . 
Having great strength and keeping her family together in this time of great suffering , AISHA Gaddafi . 
You are the hope of the Libyan people . 
Do n't give up on Ghaddafi yet . 
He is a survivor . 
Many British politicians like Galloway have exposed the lies and deception of NATO . 
The war continues while media blackout has been introduced . 
Have you noticed the lack of direct media reports from Lybia since the end of August ? 
They want you to believe that all is fine while Lybia descends into civil war . 
Ghaddafi is smart by opting for guerilla warfare . 
When NATO pulls back he will be ready to return .

2011-09-04,"BENGHAZI , Libya | Sun Sep 4 , 2011 9:22 am EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Libyan Islamist military commander who helped defend Benghazi against Muammar Gaddafi 's forces has called on the interim cabinet to resign because they are `` remnants of the old regime '' . 
In an early sign of divisions among the victors in Libya 's six-month civil war , Ismail al-Salabi also took a swipe at secular groups he said were trying to give Islamists a bad name and create political strife that would only benefit Gaddafi . 
Salabi leads the February 17 brigade which many Libyans credit with the successful last-ditch defense of Benghazi , where the uprising began on that date . 
Only later did NATO air power tip the balance in favor of the largely untrained rebel forces . 
`` The role of the executive committee is no longer required because they are remnants of the old regime . 
They should all resign , starting from the head of the pyramid all the way down , '' Salabi told Reuters in the eastern city . 
He was referring to the National Transitional Council 's de facto cabinet , which is headed by Mahmoud Jibril , who once headed Libya 's state economic think-tank under Gaddafi . 
The 40-member NTC is a disparate mix of former officials in the Gaddafi administration , businessmen , academics , lawyers and exiles . 
Salabi commands at least 3,000 fighters and reports to the interim interior ministry in Tripoli , according to an NTC spokesman . 
He accompanied NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil to a NATO meeting in Doha last month and said he fully supports him . 
Abdel Jalil resigned as Gaddafi 's justice minister after violence was used against the protests that erupted on February 17 . 
Salabi once fought in Afghanistan but denies any links to Islamist groups outside Libya , such as the Taliban and al Qaeda . 
After the anti-Gaddafi revolt , his forces received arms from the Gulf Arab state of Qatar . 
Without naming anyone , Salabi criticised those he said were trying to cast Libyan Islamist leaders as extremists . 
`` There are secularists who have their own private agenda and would like to portray us as extremist to alienate us from the international community and cause the division that will only serve the tyrant , '' he said , referring to Gaddafi . 
`` Sometimes you wonder and ask , who are they serving ? '' 
Salabi said he planned to send a memo to the NTC and its foreign allies to warn them to ensure that Libyan assets abroad , frozen to punish Gaddafi and now being released to the NTC , do not come back under control of the same officials who once handled them for Gaddafi . 
`` Lately , the -LRB- NTC -RRB- executive committee has done nothing but talk about unfreezing the assets , '' he said . 
`` These were in the names of individuals in the old regime , so if you unfreeze the assets you unfreeze them in their favor . 
They belong to the Libyan people . '' 
Big powers agreed in Paris last week to unfreeze $ 15 billion in Libyan assets once controlled by Gaddafi or his aides . 
Libya 's total foreign assets are estimated at some $ 170 billion . 
The influx of money will test the capacity and intentions of Libya 's new leaders , who are trying to restore order and public services in an oil-rich country with a glut of guns and forge a new brand of democratic politics after 42 years of one-man rule . 
`` We are asking the international community and NTC to be very , very careful , '' said Salabi , a former businessman who spent time in jail in the Gaddafi era . 
A senior NTC member said the unfrozen funds would be spent on education , security and medical care for landmine victims . 
Salabi said his fighters , hardened by six months of combat with Gaddafi 's forces , would join any battle for the coastal city of Sirte , voicing scepticism that it would surrender . 
But he said the February 17 brigade would respect deadlines set by the NTC , which has given more time for talks on a peaceful handover of the city that sits on an east-west coastal highway . 
`` With our in-depth knowledge of the hierarchy of the commanders of the forces at Sirte , we feel that unfortunately force will be the only means , '' he said . 
`` I do not believe that the tribal elders will carry weight with that leadership . '' 
Salabi said capturing southern towns still held by Gaddafi forces in Libya 's vast desert hinterland and securing the borders with Chad and Niger were formidable tasks . 
`` We still have Sabha and then Jufra , '' he said of areas in the Sahara still not under the control of the new authorities . 
`` We have to then comb this massive area between Sirte , Sabha and Jufra . 
That will be very difficult as it 's quite extensive . ''

2011-09-06,"TRIPOLI | Tue Sep 6 , 2011 10:00 am EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Colonel Muammar Gaddafi 's regime was delivered by a caterer , on a memory stick . 
Abdel Majid Mlegta ran the companies that supplied meals to Libyan government departments including the interior ministry . 
The job was `` easy , '' he told Reuters last week . 
`` I built good relations with officers . 
I wanted to serve my country . '' 
But in the first few weeks of the uprising , he secretly began to work for the rebels . 
He recruited sympathizers at the nerve center of the Gaddafi government , pinpointed its weak links and its command-and-control strength in Tripoli , and passed that information onto the rebel leadership on a series of flash memory cards . 
The first was handed to him , he says , by Gaddafi military intelligence and security officers . 
It contained information about seven key operations rooms in the capital , including internal security , the Gaddafi revolutionary committees , the popular guards -- as Gaddafi 's voluntary armed militia was known -- and military intelligence . 
The data included names of the commanders of those units , how many people worked in each center and how they worked , as well as crucial details like the number plates of their cars , and how each unit communicated with the central command led by intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi and Gaddafi 's second son Saif al-Islam . 
That memory card -- which Mlegta later handed to officials at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -LRB- NATO -RRB- -- provided the basis of a sophisticated plan to topple the Libyan dictator and seize Tripoli . 
The operation , which took months of planning , involved secretly arming rebel units inside the capital . 
Those units would help NATO destroy strategic targets in the city -- operation rooms , safe houses , military barracks , police stations , armored cars , radars and telephone centers . 
At an agreed time , the units would then rise up as rebels attacked from all sides . 
The rebels called the plan Operation Dawn Mermaid . 
This is the inside story -- much of it never before told -- of how that plan unfolded . 
The rebels were not alone . 
British operatives infiltrated Tripoli and planted radio equipment to help target air strikes and avoid killing civilians , according to U.S. and allied sources . 
The French supplied training and transport for new weapons . 
Washington helped at a critical late point by adding two extra Predator drones to the skies over Tripoli , improving NATO 's ability to strike . 
Also vital , say western and rebel officials , was the covert support of Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar . 
Doha gave weapons , military training and money to the rebels . 
By the time the rebels were ready for the final assault , they were so confident of success that they openly named the date and time of the attack : Saturday , August 20 , at 8 p.m. , just after most people in Tripoli broke their Ramadan fast . 
`` We did n't make it a secret , '' said Mohammed Gula , who led a pro-rebel political cell in central Tripoli and spoke to Reuters as rebels first entered Gaddafi 's Bab al-Aziziyah compound . 
`` We said it out on the street . 
People did n't believe us . 
They believe us now . '' 
Planning began in April , two months into the uprising . 
Rebel leader Mahmoud Jibril and three other senior insurgents met in the Tunisian city of Djerba , according to both Mlegta and another senior official from the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , as the alternative rebel government calls itself . 
The three were Mlegta , who by then had fled Tripoli and joined the rebels as the head of a brigade ; Ahmed Mustafa al-Majbary , who was head of logistics and supplies ; and Othman Abdel-Jalil , a scientist who became coordinator of the Tripoli plan . 
Before he fled , Mlegta had spent just under two months working inside the regime , building up a network of sympathizers . 
At first , 14 of Gaddafi 's officers were prepared to help . 
By the end there were 72 , Mlegta says . 
`` We used to meet at my house and sometimes at the houses of two other officers ... We preserved the secrecy of our work and it was in coordination with the NTC executive committee . '' 
Brigadier General Abdulsalam Alhasi , commander of the rebels ' main operation center in Benghazi , said those secretly helping the rebels were `` police , security , military , even some people from the cabinet ; many , many people . 
They gave us information and gave instructions to the people working with them , somehow to support the revolution . '' 
One of those was al-Barani Ashkal , commander-in-chief of the guard at Gaddafi 's military compound in the suburbs of Tripoli . 
Like many , Ashkal wanted to defect , but was asked by the NTC to remain in his post where , Alhasi says , he would become instrumental in helping the rebels enter the city . 
The rebel planning committee -- another four men would join later , making seven in all -- knew that the targets on the memory sticks were the key to crippling Gaddafi 's forces . 
The men included Hisham abu Hajar , chief commander of the Tripoli Brigade , Usama Abu Ras , who liaised with some cells inside Tripoli , and Rashed Suwan , who helped financially and coordinated with the tribes of Tripoli to ease the rebels ' entry . 
According to Mlegta and to Hisham Buhagiar , a rebel colonel and the committee 's seventh member , the group initially drew up a list of 120 sites for NATO to target in the days leading up to their attack . 
Rebel leaders discussed their idea with French President Nicolas Sarkozy at a meeting at the Elysee Palace on April 20 . 
That meeting was one of five in Paris in April and May , according to Mlegta . 
Most were attended by the chiefs of staff of NATO countries involved in the bombing campaign , which had begun in March , as well as military officials from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . 
After presenting the rebels ' plan `` from A to Z '' , Mlegta handed NATO officials three memory cards : the one packed with information about regime strongholds in Tripoli ; another with updated information on regime sites as well as details of 65 Gaddafi officers sympathetic to the rebels who had been secretly supplied with NATO radiophones ; and a third which contained the plot to take Tripoli . 
Sarkozy expressed enthusiasm for the plan , according to Mlegta and the senior NTC official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . 
The leaders slimmed the 120 targets down to 82 and `` assigned 2,000 armed men to go into Tripoli and 6,000 unarmed to go out -LRB- onto the streets -RRB- in the uprising , '' according to rebel colonel Buhagiar . 
He joined the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya in 1981 and has lived in the United States and trained as a special forces operative in both Sudan and Iraq . 
There were already anti-Gaddafi cells in the capital that the rebels knew they could activate . 
`` The problem was that we needed time , '' the senior NTC official said . 
`` We feared that some units may go out into the streets in a spontaneous way and they would be quashed . 
We also needed time to smuggle weapons , fighters and boats . '' 
In the early months of the uprising , pro-rebel fighters had slipped out of Tripoli and made their way to the north-western city of Misrata , where they were trained for the uprising , rebels in Misrata told Reuters in June . 
The leaders of two rebel units said `` hundreds '' of Tripoli residents had begun slipping back into the city by mid-July . 
Commander Alhasi and other rebel officers in Benghazi said the number of infiltrators sent into Tripoli was dozens , not hundreds . 
`` This was not D-Day , '' Alhasi told Reuters in his office . 
Most of the infiltrators traveled to Tripoli by fishing trawler , according to Alhasi . 
They were equipped with light weapons -- rifles and sub-machineguns -- hand grenades , demolition charges and radios . 
`` We could call them and they could call each other , '' Alhasi said . 
`` Most of them were volunteers , from all parts of Libya , and Libyans from overseas . 
Everybody wants to do something for the success of the revolution . '' 
Although Tripoli was ostensibly under the control of Gaddafi loyalists , rebels said the security system was porous : bribery or other ruses could be used to get in and out . 
Small groups of men also began probing the government 's security system with nighttime attacks on checkpoints , according to one operative who talked to Reuters in June . 
It was possible to smuggle weapons into Tripoli , but it was easier and less risky -- if far more expensive -- to buy them from Gaddafi loyalists looking to make a profit before the regime collapsed . 
The going rate for a Kalashnikov in Tripoli was $ 5,000 over the summer ; in Misrata the same weapon cost $ 3,000 . 
Morale got a boost when rebels broke into government communication channels and recorded 2,000 calls between the regime 's top leadership , including a few with Gaddafi 's sons , on everything from military orders to sex . 
The NTC mined the taped calls for information and broadcast some of them on rebel TV , a move that frightened the regime , according to the senior NTC source . 
`` They knew then that we had infiltrated and broken into their ranks . '' 
Recordings of two of the calls were also handed to the International Criminal Court . 
One featured Gaddafi 's prime minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi threatening to burn the family of Abdel Rahman Shalgham , a one-time Libyan ambassador to the United Nations and an early defector to the rebels . 
Al-Mahmoudi described Shalgham as a slave . 
The other was between al-Mahmoudi and Tayeb al-Safi , minister of economy and trade ; the pair joked about how the Gaddafi brigades would rape the women of Zawiyah when they entered the town . 
Several allied and U.S. officials , as well as a source close to the Libyan rebels , said that around the beginning of May , foreign military trainers including British , French and Italian operatives , as well as representatives from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates , began to organize serious efforts to hone the rebels into a more effective fighting force . 
Most of the training happened in the rebel-held Western Mountains . 
But Eric Denece , a former French intelligence operative and now Director of the French Center for Research on Intelligence , says an elite rebel force of fighters from the east was trained both inside and outside Libya , at NATO bases and those of other allies . 
This `` overseas brigade '' was then dropped back into the country . 
In all , estimated Denece , some 100-200 foreign operatives were sent to Libya , where they focused on training and military coordination . 
Mlegta confirms that number . 
Rebel commander Alhasi insists western special forces were not involved in combat ; the main help they gave was with the bombing campaign and training . 
London , Paris and Washington also say their troops were not involved in combat . 
`` They complied with our -LRB- bombing -RRB- requirements , immediately sometimes , sometimes we had a delay , '' said Alhasi , who has a big satellite photograph of Tripoli on one of his walls . 
`` We had the information on the ground about the targets and relayed it to them . '' 
A European official knowledgeable about such operations said `` dozens '' of plain-clothes French military advisers were sent to Libya . 
A French official said between 30 and 40 `` military advisers '' helped organize the rebels and trained them on basic weapons and more high-tech hardware . 
In May , the French began smuggling weapons into western Libya . 
French military spokesmen later confirmed these arms drops , saying they were justified as `` humanitarian support '' , but also briefing that the aim was to prepare for an advance on Tripoli . 
British undercover personnel carried out some of the most important on-the-ground missions by allied forces before the fall of Tripoli , U.S. and allied officials told Reuters . 
One of their key tasks , according to allied officials , was planting radio equipment to help allied forces target Gaddafi 's military forces and command-and-control centers . 
This involved dangerous missions to infiltrate the capital , locate specific potential targets and then plant equipment so bomber planes could precisely target munitions , destroying sensitive targets without killing bystanders . 
In mid-March , a month after violent resistance to Gaddafi 's rule first erupted , President Obama had signed a sweeping top secret order , known as a covert operations `` finding '' , which gave broad authorization to the CIA to support the rebels . 
But while the general authorization encompassed a wide variety of possible measures , the presidential finding required the CIA to come back to the White House for specific permissions to move ahead and help them . 
Several U.S. officials said that , because of concerns about the rebels ' disorganization , internal politics , and limited paramilitary capabilities , clandestine U.S. support on the ground never went much beyond intelligence collection . 
U.S. officials acknowledge that as rebel forces closed in on Tripoli , such intelligence `` collection '' efforts by the CIA and other American agencies in Libya became very extensive and included efforts to help the rebels and other NATO allies track down Gaddafi and his entourage . 
But the Obama administration 's intention , the officials indicated , was that if any such intelligence fell into American hands it would be passed onto others . 
A senior U.S. defense official disclosed to Reuters details of a legal opinion showing the Pentagon would not be able to supply lethal aid to the rebels -- even with the U.S. recognition of the NTC . 
`` It was a legal judgment that the quasi-recognition that we gave to the NTC as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people did n't check the legal box to authorize us to be providing lethal assistance under the Arms Export Control Act , '' the senior official said . 
In some ways the rebels ' most unlikely ally was Qatar . 
The Gulf Arab state is keen to downplay its role , perhaps understandably given that it is ruled by an absolute monarch . 
But on the ground , signs abounded of the emirate 's support . 
The weapons and equipment the French brought in were mostly supplied by Qatar , according to rebel sources . 
In May , a Reuters reporter saw equipment in boxes clearly stamped `` Qatar . '' 
It included mortar kits , military fatigues , radios and binoculars . 
At another location , Reuters saw new anti-tank missiles . 
Qatar 's decision to supply arms to the rebellion , one source close to the NTC told Reuters , was instigated by influential Libyan Islamist scholar Ali Salabi , who sought refuge in Qatar after fleeing Libya in the late 1990s . 
He had previously worked with Gaddafi 's son Saif , to help rehabilitate Libyans who had fought in Afghanistan . 
Salabi 's brother Ismael is also a leader of a rebel militia in Libya . 
Salabi `` is the link to the influential figures in Qatar , and convinced the Qataris to get involved , '' said the source close to the NTC . 
By early June , Libya seemed locked in a stalemate . 
After three months of civil war , rebels had seized huge swathes of territory , but NATO bombing had failed to dislodge Gaddafi . 
The African Union said the only way forward was a ceasefire and negotiated peace . 
London joined Paris in suggesting that while Gaddafi must step down , perhaps he could stay in Libya . 
But hidden away from view , the plan to seize Tripoli was moving into action . 
The rebels began making swift advances in the Western Mountains , out of Misrata and around the town of Zintan . 
Newly arrived Apache attack helicopters operating from Britain 's HMS Ocean , an amphibious assault ship , were destroying armored vehicles . 
NATO aircraft dropped leaflets to dispirit Gaddafi forces and improve rebel morale . 
`` The game-changer has been the attack helicopters which have given the NTC more protection from Gaddafi 's heavy weapons , '' a French Defense Ministry official said . 
The rebels ' foreign backers were eager to hasten the war . 
For one thing , a U. N. mandate for bombing ran only to the end of September ; agreement on an extension was not guaranteed . 
One U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters the main U.S. concern was `` breaking the rough stalemate before the end of the NATO mandate '' . 
The Europeans were also burning through costly munitions and Washington was concerned about wear and tear on NATO allies ' aircraft . 
`` Some of the countries ... basically every deployable F-16 they had in the inventory was deployed , '' a senior U.S. defense official told Reuters . 
But the momentum was shifting in the rebels ' favor . 
On July 28 , the assassination of rebel military commander Abdel Fatah Younes proved a surprise turning-point . 
The former Interior Minister had defected to the rebels in February . 
Some believe he had held back their advance from the east , for reasons that remain unclear . 
Younes ' death at the hands of his own men raised questions about the NTC and added impetus to NATO 's desire to push things along in case the anti-Gaddafi forces imploded . 
The West forced NTC head Mahmoud Jibril to change his cabinet . 
NATO then took more of the lead in preparations , according to Denece , who said he has contacts within both French and Libyan intelligence . 
There was another boon to the rebels . 
Regional heavyweight Turkey came out in support of the NTC in July , and then held a conference at which 30 countries backed them . 
`` The Turks actually were very helpful throughout this in a very quiet kind of way , '' said the senior U.S. defense official . 
With the morale of Gaddafi troops eroding , the end was clearly near . 
Mediocre at the best of times , Gaddafi 's fighters began fading away . 
So too did his secret weapon : foreign mercenaries . 
After the uprising began , Gaddafi recruited several thousand mercenaries ; some formed the core of his best-organised forces . 
Most of the hired guns came from countries to Libya 's south such as Chad , Mali , and Niger , but some were from further afield , including South Africa and the Balkans . 
Among them was a former Bosnian Serb fighter who had fought in Sierra Leone as a mercenary and later worked as a contractor in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
Hired in March , first as an instructor and later as the commander of a 120mm mortar battery , the fighter , who used his nom-de-guerre Crni -LRB- `` the Black '' in Serbian -RRB- , told Reuters he had been paid regularly in cash in the western currency of his choice . 
`` I knew Libyans had poor discipline , but what I have seen was dismal in comparison with what we had in former Yugoslavia during our wars , '' he told Reuters . 
`` They were cowards , at least many of them . 
Communications were the biggest problem , as they just could n't figure out how to operate anything more sophisticated than a walkie-talkie , so we resorted to cellphones , when they worked and while they worked . '' 
It was in early August , he said , that `` everything started falling apart . '' 
The force of which he was a part began retreating from a rebel onslaught . 
`` At some point we came under fire from a very organised group , and I suspect they were infiltrated -LRB- by -RRB- NATO ground troops , '' he said . 
The loyalist units pulled back to a point about 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli . 
By mid-August , `` I decided it was enough . 
I took a jeep with plenty of fuel and water and another two Libyans I trusted , and we traveled across the desert to a neighboring country . 
It took us four days to get there . '' 
Foreign agents , meanwhile , were circulating far and wide . 
At the Tunisia-Libya border in early August , a Reuters reporter ran into a Libyan with an American accent who identified himself as the head of the rebel command center in the Western Mountains . 
He was accompanied by two muscular blond western men . 
He said he spent a lot of time in the United States and Canada , but would not elaborate . 
As the rebels advanced on Zawiyah , the Reuters reporter also saw western-looking men inside the Western Mountain region traveling in simple , old pickup trucks . 
Not far away , rebels in Nalut said they were being aided by CIA agents , though this was impossible to verify . 
Operation Dawn Mermaid was initially meant to begin on August 10 , according to Mohammed Gula , the political cell leader in central Tripoli . 
But `` other cities were not yet ready '' , the leadership decided , and it was put off for a few days . 
A debate flared inside the Pentagon about whether to send extra Predator drones to Libya . 
`` It was a controversial issue even as to whether it made sense to pull -LRB- drones -RRB- from other places to boost this up to try to bring this to a quicker conclusion , '' the U.S. defense official said . 
Those who backed the use of extra drones won , and the last two Predators were taken from a training base in the United States and sent to north Africa , arriving on August 16 . 
In the meantime , the rebels had captured several cities . 
By August 17 or 18 , recalls Gula , `` when we heard that Zawiyah had fallen , and Zlitan looked like it was about to fall , and Garyan had fallen , we decided now is the time . '' 
Those successes had a knock-on effect , U.S. and NATO officials told Reuters . 
With much of the country now conquered , Predator drones and other surveillance and strike planes could finally be focused on the capital . 
Data released by the Pentagon showed a substantial increase in the pace of U.S. air strikes in Libya between August 10 and August 22 . 
`` We did n't have to scan the entire country any longer , '' a NATO official said . 
`` We were able to focus on where the concentrations of regime forces were . '' 
Days before the attack on Tripoli , the White House began leaking stories to TV networks saying Gaddafi was near the end . 
But U.S. intelligence officials -- who are supposed to give an objective view of the situation on the ground -- were pushing back , telling journalists they were not so sure of immediate victory and the fighting could go on for months . 
Then , on August 19 , a breakthrough : Abdel Salam Jalloud , one of the most public faces of Gaddafi 's regime , defected . 
Jalloud had been trying to get out for the previous three months , according to the senior NTC official . 
`` He asked for our help but because he wanted his whole family , not only his immediate one , to flee with him it was a logistical problem . 
His whole family was around 35 . '' 
By now , the mountain roads were under rebel control . 
They took him and his family from Tripoli to Zintan and across the border into Tunisia . 
From there , he flew to Italy and on to Qatar . 
The rebel leadership was ready . 
But now NATO wanted more time . 
`` Once they got control of Zawiyah , we were sort of expecting that they would make a strategic pause , regroup and then make the push on into Tripoli , '' the senior U.S. defense official said . 
`` We told NATO we 're going to go anyway , '' said a senior NTC official . 
The western alliance quickly scaled back its number of bombing targets to 32 from 82 , while rebel special forces hit some of the control rooms that were not visible , like those in schools and hospitals . 
The signal to attack came soon after sunset on August 20 , in a speech by NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil . 
`` The noose is tightening , '' he said . 
A `` veritable bloodbath '' was about to occur . 
Within 10 minutes of his speech , rebel cells in neighborhoods across Tripoli started moving . 
Some units were directly linked to the operation ; many others were not but had learned about the plan . 
`` We did n't choose it , the circumstances and the operations led us to this date , '' Alhasi told Reuters when asked why the uprising in Tripoli began then . 
`` There was a public plan in Tripoli that they would rise up on that day , by calling from the mosques . 
It was not a military plan , not an official plan , it was a people 's plan . 
The people inside Tripoli , they did this in coordination with us . '' 
In the first few hours , rebel cells attacked installations and command posts . 
Others simply secured neighborhoods , setting up roadblocks and impeding movement . 
Ships laden with food and ammunition set off from rebel-held Misrata . 
Rebel forces began pushing toward the capital from the Western Mountains and from the east . 
According to French newspapers , NATO cleared a path on the water by destroying pro-Gaddafi speed boats equipped with explosives . 
The first rebel soldiers reached the city within a few hours . 
The rag-tag army did n't look like much : some warriors wore football kit bearing the name of English soccer players . 
But they encountered little resistance . 
One rebel source said Gaddafi had made a fatal error by sending his important brigades and military leaders , including his son Mu'atassem , to secure the oil town of Brega . 
The Libyan leader apparently feared the loss of the oil area would empower the rebels . 
But it meant he left Tripoli without strong defences , allowing the rebels easy entry . 
The air war was also overwhelming the regime . 
Under attack , Gaddafi forces brought whatever heavy equipment they still had out of hiding . 
In the final 24 hours , a western military official said , NATO `` could see remnants of Gaddafi forces trying to reconstitute weapons systems , specifically surface-to-air missiles '' . 
NATO pounded with them with air strikes . 
By Sunday August 21 , the rebels controlled large parts of Tripoli . 
In the confusion , the NTC announced it had captured Saif al-Islam . 
Late the following evening , though , he turned up at the Rixos , the Tripoli hotel where foreign reporters were staying . 
`` I am here to disperse the rumors ... , '' he declared . 
U.S. and European officials now say they believe Saif was never in custody . 
NTC chief Mahmoud Jibril attributes the fiasco to conflicting reports within the rebel forces . 
But , he says , the bumbling turned into a bonanza : `` The news of his arrest gave us political gains . 
Some countries recognized us , some brigades surrendered ... and more than 30 officers defected . '' 
As the Gaddafi brigades collapsed , the rebels reached a sympathizer in the Libyan military who patched them into the radio communications of Gaddafi 's forces . 
`` We could hear the panic through their orders , '' said the senior NTC official . 
`` That was the first indication that our youths were in control of Tripoli . '' 
As the hunt for Gaddafi got underway , the NTC began implementing a 70-page plan , drawn up in consultation with its foreign military backers , aimed at establishing security in the capital . 
Officials in London , Paris and Washington are at pains to say the plan is not based on the experience of Iraq or any other country , but the lessons of their mistakes in Baghdad are obvious . 
At a press conference in Qatar , NTC head Jibril said Libya would `` rehabilitate and cure our wounds by being united so we can rebuild the nation . '' 
Unity was not hard to find during the uprising . 
`` The most important factor was the will of the people , '' commander Alhasi told Reuters . 
`` The people hate Gaddafi . '' 
Will Libya remain united once he 's gone ?

2011-09-07,"TRIPOLI | Wed Sep 7 , 2011 10:10 am EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A major Western defense firm was upgrading military equipment for an elite Libyan security brigade just before an uprising against Muammar Gaddafi , documents show , showing how the West tried to foster ties with him during his final years in power . 
Less than a month before the start of the revolt , the British arm of U.S.-based General Dynamics was making arrangements to improve communications systems for tanks , artillery and armored troop carriers for the Khamis Brigade , which played a lead role in cracking down on the revolt , according to documents found by Reuters at a brigade base . 
General Dynamics said the upgrade was never completed . 
But the documents illustrate in detail for the first time what weapons were involved in the deal and that the firm was doing business with Gaddafi 's forces on the eve of the uprising . 
It said the equipment might have been included in the British subsidiary 's May 2008 contract with Libya -- an 85 million pound -LRB- $ 136 million -RRB- deal to provide a tactical communications and data system as part of what it termed at the time `` the United Kingdom 's initiatives to improve economic , educational and defense links with Libya . '' 
This was after Gaddafi , widely ostracized abroad for much of his 42-year rule because the West accused him of supporting terrorism , abandoned his program of mass-destruction weapons in 2003 , returning Libya to mainstream international politics . 
The Khamis Brigade , led by and named after one of Gaddafi 's sons , was the best equipped of Libya 's security forces and was directly involved in putting down the uprising in cities such as Misrata and Tripoli , where thousands of people were killed . 
Peter Bouckaert , emergencies director with Human Rights Watch , said the brigades commanded by Khamis , and another Gaddafi son , Mutassim , were able to become so strong thanks in part to procurement from Western countries . 
`` These elite brigades ... had access to the most modern weapons , '' he said . 
`` We 've documented arms sales from not just the usual suspects but also Western companies . 
`` I think the lesson is that if you 're going to sell weapons to dictators , at some point down the line you 're going to be deeply embarrassed . '' 
A letter from a General Dynamics UK project manager , Simon Kirkham , to Libya 's defense ministry dated January 25 was found this week in the Khamis Brigade 's bullet-scarred compound near Tripoli . 
That date marked the start of anti-government protests in Egypt , to Libya 's east . 
Libya 's neighbor to the west , Tunisia , had already toppled its president and political analysts were predicting similar protests could erupt against Gaddafi . 
The note , and an Arabic document accompanying it , listed 40 T-72 tanks , eight Palmaria artillery pieces , four BTR-60 armored personnel carriers , 10 Shilka anti-aircraft systems and two M-113 armored personnel carriers to be upgraded . 
`` These platforms are required to meet the proposed 1 April conversion deadline , '' said the letter , which listed offices in England and Wales . 
A spokesman for General Dynamics , Rob Doolittle , said he could not comment specifically on the documents without seeing them , but said the equipment might have been included in the British subsidiary 's May 2008 contract with Libya . 
That deal came as `` part of the United Kingdom 's initiatives to improve economic , educational and defense links with Libya , '' a statement released at the time said . 
`` It will provide communications and data handling capabilities , together with technical and training support , to the Elite Brigade of Libya 's armed forces , '' the release said . 
Doolittle said the firm did not finish deploying the system , involving a process sometimes referred to as `` conversion '' -- switching from one communications system to another -- and did not train Libyan forces in its use . 
A small group of General Dynamics UK employees working on the system were withdrawn from Libya in early February , he added . 
Inside the Khamis Brigade compound , a narrow road cuts through rows of planted cypress trees which shield the central area from view . 
The burned-out husks of tanks and ammunition crates lay tucked between the trees . 
Human rights activists and analysts say the Khamis unit played a major role in the civil war , spearheading the fight against NATO-backed rebels who took up arms after a crackdown on anti-government protesters in February . 
A leaked 2009 U.S. diplomatic cable said the brigade `` effectively serves as a regime protection unit . '' 
Libyans knew the brigade for its discipline and fierce loyalty to Gaddafi . 
`` This was a place of torture , a place of imprisonment , a place of mercenaries and a place of terrorism , '' Abdel Hafidth Iswad , a former rebel now helping guard the compound , said . 
The General Dynamics UK deal to provide communications technology to the unit came the year after former Prime Minister Tony Blair 's 2007 visit to Libya , a seminal moment in the push to warmer relations between Gaddafi and the West . 
For years , Gaddafi had been shunned for his government 's alleged role in bombings and other attacks in Britain and elsewhere , and was accused by human rights activists of brutal repression of dissent at home . 
The documents obtained by Reuters showed the General Dynamics UK work was scheduled up to and through the date the revolt broke out , with start dates between February 10 and February 24 , and end dates between February 24 and March 17 . 
Separate documents found by Human Rights Watch in the unit 's compound , overrun by anti-Gaddafi fighters last month and now open to journalists , showed the brigade was receiving arms from a variety of countries and companies . 
One 2004 order marked the delivery of Russian-made Kalashnikov rifles , and one from 2009 showed an unspecified delivery was made from South Africa . 
Another 2009 order showed rifles came from Belgium 's FN Herstal . 
Boxes of those FN rifles now litter the compound , including the archives room where many of the documents related to the daily functioning , tactical planning and weapons procurement of the base were found . 
`` Is anyone surprised these weapons were used against his -LRB- Gaddafi 's -RRB- own people ? '' 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
If it 's based in America it is American , so what if they have a section in the UK ? 
So you see , the US government has no problem with American companies providing weapons and technology to unpopular undemocratic regimes . 
Corporations rule American policy . 
Kind of interesting , but no big surprise , we are n't the most moral country . 
Hey -- Our government tortures ! 
You can not expect much from the good old USA anymore . 
Why would they be embarrassed ? 
I 'm sure it was a very lucrative deal for them . 
Kind of like Halliburton 's current drilling operations in Iran . 
Or Reagan 's arms deals to the Mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan -LRB- early Al Qaeda brigades -RRB- . 
You ca n't embarrass these people . 
Making more than one billion dollars means never having to say you 're sorry .

2011-09-07,"U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South . 
Full Article Gaddafi tracked heading south - Libyan official BENGHAZI , Libya\/AGADEZ , Niger | Wed Sep 7 , 2011 6:30 pm IST BENGHAZI , Libya\/AGADEZ , Niger -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi was last tracked heading for Libya 's southern border , the man leading the hunt told Reuters , though Burkina Faso again denied on Wednesday any plan to offer the deposed leader refuge . 
After the arrival in neighbouring Niger of dozens of Libyan vehicles , including some which may be carrying gold and cash , the United States said the convoy included aides to Gaddafi and urged authorities in Niger to hold any war crimes suspects . 
Niger has denied Gaddafi is in the poor , landlocked former French colony . 
But a French military source has told Reuters that he and his son Saif al-Islam may have planned to rendezvous with the convoy in the Sahara , possibly via Algeria , before heading for Burkina Faso , which in the past had offered refuge . 
Hisham Buhagiar , who coordinates efforts by Libya 's interim government to find the ousted strongman , said he had evidence he may have been near the southern village of Ghwat , some 300 km -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- north of the border with Niger , three days ago . 
`` The last tracks , he was in the Ghwat area . 
People saw the cars going in that direction , '' Buhagiar said in an interview late on Tuesday . 
`` We have it from many sources that he 's trying to go further south , towards Chad or Niger . '' 
Burkina President Blaise Compaore denied discussing giving Gaddafi sanctuary . 
`` We have no information regarding the presence of Libyans on our soil since these events , and we have had no contacts with anyone in Libya about a request for political asylum , '' he told reporters in the capital Ouagadougou . 
Compaore has ruled for 24 years after taking power , like Gaddafi , in a military coup . 
And like other African states , Burkina benefited from oil-funded Libyan aid under Gaddafi . 
Niger has also tried to distance itself . 
Officials have confirmed that Gaddafi 's security chief Mansour Dhao had been let in but insisted it was a humanitarian gesture . 
Its interior minister denied on Tuesday a report from Niger and French military sources that 200-250 Libyan army vehicles had arrived via Algeria on Monday near the northern town of Agadez . 
As with all efforts so far to find Gaddafi , two full weeks after his Tripoli headquarters were overrun by the motley collection of rebel groups who rose up in February , the trail is hazy , in a region where people are few and far between . 
Buhagiar also said : `` He 's out of Bani Walid , I think . '' 
He was referring to the besieged tribal bastion , 150 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , where fighters of the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- have been trying to negotiate the surrender of a hard core of Gaddafi loyalists . 
NTC commanders said last week they thought Gaddafi , 69 , was there planning a counter-strike with Saif al-Islam , his heir apparent , and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi . 
But it appears the senior figures are not there now , officials say . 
All three are wanted by the International Criminal Court at The Hague for war crimes committed during the revolt -- though Libyans say they want to try them first , including for atrocities over the four decades before this year 's uprising . 
U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he was unsure whether , as U.S. officials have said , Gaddafi was still in Libya : `` I think he 's been taking a lot of steps to make sure that in the end he could try to get out if he had to , but as to where , when , and how that 'll take place , we just do n't know . '' 
Gaddafi 's fugitive spokesman , Moussa Ibrahim , insisted in a call to Reuters on Tuesday that he had not left . 
`` He is in Libya . 
He is safe , he is very healthy , in high morale . '' 
NTC commanders have said this week they believe Ibrahim may be in Bani Walid , where a tense standoff continued . 
Outside the town on Wednesday , residents leaving through a sun-scorched NTC checkpoint set up around the nearby settlement of Wishtata painted an increasingly desperate picture inside Bani Walid . 
`` People are terrorised . 
There is no one in the streets , '' said Salah Ali , 39 . 
`` But many still support Gaddafi because they were paid by the regime , because many have committed crimes and are afraid of arrest . '' 
Inside Bani Walid , tucked away in a valley in barren hills south of the capital , residents said Gaddafi-era green flags still wave above houses and a portrait of the `` Brother Leader '' in military uniform towers above its central square . 
Shooting in the air and shouting insults from the back of their pick-up trucks , groups of Gaddafi loyalists regularly speed through its streets , residents said . 
They often shout `` Allah , Muammar , Libya , nothing else ! '' 
-- the principal slogan of the old regime , especially during this year 's civil war . 
`` I went to see my family there yesterday , '' said Imad Mohammed Ali , a 21-year-old supporter of the new leadership . 
`` There is no electricity , no cooking gas , no communications . 
There is n't enough food . 
People are using coal to make fire . 
There is no medicine . 
There are no people in the streets . '' 
Aid agencies have also raised concerns about conditions for civilians in the coastal city of Sirte , Gaddafi 's birthplace and another redoubt of tribal leaders still loyal to him . 
Libya 's southern desert is also not under the control of the NTC .

2011-09-08,"Gaddafi vows to fight on , Libyans try to move on TRIPOLI | Thu Sep 8 , 2011 7:26 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The voice of Muammar Gaddafi boomed out from his hiding place on Thursday , denying he had fled Libya and cursing as rats and stray dogs those whose efforts to start governing in his place are being frustrated by his diehard followers . 
`` We will not leave our ancestral land , '' Gaddafi said in what Syria 's Arrai TV said was a live broadcast from somewhere in Libya . 
`` The youths are now ready to escalate the resistance against the rats in Tripoli and to finish off the mercenaries . '' 
`` Our resolute Libyan people , the Libyan land is your own , '' said the 69-year-old who ran the country since he was 27 until two weeks ago . 
`` Those who try to take it from you now , they are intruders , they are mercenaries , they are stray dogs . '' 
Backing up his words , a cannonade of Grad missiles flew out of Bani Walid , a desert town south of Tripoli where a hard core of loyalists -- estimated by their opponents at about 150 -- are under siege by the new interim government . 
Some of its commanders suspect Gaddafi himself might be hiding inside . 
Two of the defenders were killed and one of the siege force wounded in overnight skirmishing , though a military spokesman for the National Transitional Council said the new rulers would abide by a truce until Saturday to allow negotiated surrenders at Bani Walid and Gaddafi 's home town of Sirte , on the coast . 
`` We can do it within two hours maximum , '' Ahmed Bani said of taking over Bani Walid . 
He said he believed Gaddafi 's son and heir-apparent Saif al-Islam was there , though he did not share the belief of some others in the NTC that his father was . 
Referring to the arrivals this week of senior Gaddafi aides in Niger , across the Sahara desert , which prompted speculation that could be an escape route , Bani said : `` He 's a fox . 
Maybe he wants us to believe that he 's out -LRB- of Libya -RRB- but he 's inside ... close to the border so that in an emergency he can escape . '' 
In remarks which clearly indicated he was speaking after the reports from Niger were published , Gaddafi said : `` This is not the first time that convoys drive in and out of Niger . '' 
Despite the sweeping and sudden nature of their victory in Tripoli two weeks ago after six months of civil war , the new leadership is still struggling to impose its authority across the capital and the rest of the sprawling , oil-rich desert nation which is home to just six million people . 
The stalemates around Sirte , Bani Walid and south into the desert town of Sabha -- all pro-Gaddafi bastions -- means the original rebel stronghold of Benghazi is still largely cut off from Tripoli , an 800-km -LRB- 500-mile -RRB- drive away to the west . 
NTC leaders have said they hope to be pumping oil again next week , and the new head of the central bank briefed the media on Thursday to assure Libyans and their foreign business partners that the bank had not been looted by fleeing members of the old regime . 
Business as usual was the watchword . 
In another nod to getting down to government , the interim prime minister Mahmoud Jibril was making his first appearance in Tripoli on Thursday since the uprising . 
But there is still considerable doubt , contradiction and hesitation about moving the operations of the NTC from Benghazi to the capital . 
Some of that delay appears to stem from long-standing regional rivalries and from a sense that Tripoli may not be a safe place for every Libyan official , as potentially rival militias coalesce around the rebel brigades which swept in to the city from different towns and provinces , eager for a share of power that for 42 years was in the hands of one man only . 
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen assured Libyans the Western military alliance whose air power helped topple Gaddafi will keep up the pressure . 
`` NATO and our partners will continue the mission as long as the threat remains , but not a minute longer , '' Rasmussen said . 
`` Gaddafi and the remains of his machine must realize that there is nothing to be gained from more fighting . '' 
Nevertheless , Western officials are keen to play down the extent to which they will -- or can -- help track Gaddafi down . 
The U.S. ambassador to NATO , Ivo Daalder , said Gaddafi 's capture might not signal the end of the campaign : `` It is n't clear that if he were to be taken out that the whole thing would necessarily collapse ; we just do n't know that . 
`` We do know that if he does n't have the capability to pose a threat to civilians , then it does n't really matter . '' 
A diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , repeated alliance statements that NATO was not searching for Gaddafi and suggested its ground surveillance did not cover the south of Libya , which borders countries to which Gaddafi might flee . 
`` The operations plan that we adopted limited the area of operations to the coastal area , '' he said . 
`` It is very expensive and difficult to monitor the entire country , which is mostly desert and very big , '' he said . 
`` Since this was fundamentally about protecting people , rather than watching sands , this was where the resources were located . ''

God help the people of Libya . 
Both NATO and Qaddafi are foxes , it is only the NTC and its rag tag forces that have little or no clue about what is going on . 
Once NATO has access to major coastal oil cities and oil can flow , why would they waste resources to hunt for their former - friend-though stubborn ? 
For Qaddafi , if his resistance can give headache to the NTC and help his former loyalists have strong bargain -- why not keep NTC rebels on their toes . 
In the end it is NTC to loose , soon the Libyans will kick them out through elections or otherwise . 
After all any new Govt will still trade with NATO countries only that it may not be as strongly opposed to western exploitation of Libya\/Africa as Qaddafi regime has been . 
There is likely to be much news from Libya for sometime before a real new indigineous authority , not just a NATO proxy NTC settles in place !

2011-09-09,"By Maria Golovnina and Sherine El Madany NORTH OF BANI WALID\/EAST OF SIRTE , Libya | Fri Sep 9 , 2011 4:06 pm EDT NORTH OF BANI WALID\/EAST OF SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fighters loyal to Libya 's new rulers launched what appeared to be assaults on the final bastions of Muammar Gaddafi loyalists on Friday , with fighting reported inside the town of Bani Walid and near Gaddafi 's home town of Sirte . 
The battles at the two towns broke out a day before a deadline set by Libya 's interim National Transitional Council for Gaddafi holdout towns to surrender or face onslaughts . 
NTC officials said the outbreaks of fighting meant the ceasefire had effectively been scrapped . 
That could pave the way for some of the final battles of a six-month civil war . 
Fighters besieging Bani Walid went into the town a day ahead of the deadline to protect civilians and were engaged in street-to-street fighting with Gaddafi forces , an NTC official near the town said . 
An NTC spokesman said battles also began outside Sirte in response to barrages of rockets fired by pro-Gaddafi forces . 
The two towns , along with the remote desert outpost of Sabha , are the main areas still in control of Gaddafi loyalists since NTC fighters overran his Tripoli headquarters last month . 
The NTC said it had also dispatched hundreds of fighters deep into the desert , headed toward Sabha where it was advancing . 
NTC official Abdallah Kanshil said fighters had entered Bani Walid from the north , east and south and had advanced as close as 2 km -LRB- 1.5 miles -RRB- from a market in the center . 
Anti-Gaddafi forces believe some of Gaddafi 's sons , and possibly even the ousted leader himself , are holed up in the town , 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- southeast of the capital . 
NTC spokesman Ahmed Bani said battles had also erupted close to a river near Sirte after pro-Gaddafi forces fired rockets at NTC forces laying siege to it . 
The coastal city was just a village when Gaddafi was born there 69 years ago , but has become a power base , lavished with cash under his rule . 
`` They attacked our forces so we had to answer them . 
There was shelling and there was no way to avoid that , '' Bani said . 
Asked if the fighting meant Saturday 's ceasefire deadline had been effectively scrapped , he said : `` Yes , it was breakable . '' 
Kanshil estimated loyalist forces in Bani Walid at around 600 men , more than previous estimates . 
`` People are very afraid , that is why we have to go in , '' he said . 
Troops were still hoping to avert `` full-scale war '' and had entered Bani Walid without orders from central NTC command . 
One NTC fighter had been killed so far and four wounded in Bani Walid while three Gaddafi fighters were killed and three wounded , Kanshil said . 
Seven Gaddafi loyalists were captured . 
Reuters reporters near both towns said volleys of Grad rockets had been fired by Gaddafi loyalists at NTC fighters earlier in the day . 
Ambulances streamed back and forth with casualties from near Bani Walid , and NTC fighters grabbed crates of rocket-propelled grenades and mortars and raced to the front . 
Smoke rose from the frontline and NATO warplanes roared overhead . 
Officials at the National Transitional Council 's Tripoli military headquarters told Reuters that between 100 and 150 vehicles had set off into the desert for Sabha on Friday . 
More would leave in convoy later in the day and into Saturday . 
`` There are people going from Jadu , from Zintan , from Tripoli , there is a mixture , '' NTC fighter Abu Aziz Selem told Reuters as he rushed out of the capital with a Kalashnikov assault rifle slung over each of his shoulders . 
Families trickled out of Bani Walid before the fighting intensified , belongings crammed into their cars . 
`` I 'm taking my family away from war , '' said Khalid Ahmouda , stopping his car briefly to speak to Reuters . 
`` They are afraid because there will be a big fight today or tomorrow . '' 
His veiled wife , Oum Abdurahman , leaned from a window , holding her baby son . 
`` There 's no power , no food , no water . 
Many people want to leave but have no fuel for their cars and Gaddafi forces are preventing people from leaving , '' she said . 
`` They fire in the air to terrorise people . 
Today we managed to leave , '' she said , adding her brother-in-law was among 11 people killed in a May 25 crackdown on anti-Gaddafi protests . 
NTC officials at a checkpoint 30 km from Bani Walid said Gaddafi fighters had been captured . 
Reuters witnesses saw some men driven away with their hands tied behind them , as well as two bodies , said to be Gaddafi fighters , in a pick-up truck . 
Muammar Gaddafi 's location is still a mystery . 
In a defiant message broadcast on Thursday though , he said he was still in Libya to lead the fight against what he called `` rats '' and `` stray dogs '' who had taken over the capital . 
Interpol issued arrest warrants for him , his son Saif al-Islam and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi , all wanted by the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- for war crimes . 
Four top officials , including Gaddafi 's air force commander and a general in charge of his forces in the south , were among a new group of Libyans who have fled to neighboring Niger , officials in Niger said . 
Niger said it would respect its commitments to the Hague-based international court if Gaddafi or his sons arrived , but had accepted the lower-ranked officials as a humanitarian case . 
`` We are signatories of the -LRB- ICC 's -RRB- Rome Statute so they know what they are exposed to if they come , '' said the head of President Mahamadou Issoufou 's cabinet , Massaoudou Hassoumi . 
Most residents of Sabha , Bani Walid and Sirte are trapped and awaiting either a final battle or a surrender . 
`` We are not seeing many people leaving . 
How can they ? '' 
Khalid al-Riahi , an NTC commander outside Sabha , told Reuters by phone . 
`` They have no money , they ca n't afford to buy fuel , which is scarce and more expensive . 
The city is too remote to have regular supplies and the road is not safe at all . '' 
Sabha , deep in the desert , has been cut off from the rest of the country since shortly after the fall of Tripoli and little information is available about the situation in the town of 100,000 people , home to many sub-Saharan African migrants . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Translation : I was out-foxed by Al Qaeda militias who killed my commander -LRB- Younis -RRB- , then rushed in to take Tripoli before me . 
Okay , I had a pretty good tumbling run , but couldn t stick my landing . 
I better retreat back to Cyrenaica and leave Tripolitania to Al Qaeda revolutionaries -LRB- = this experiment -RRB- , before they decide to slit my pale tender throat ! 
The media took chose its side from the beginning and has only reported from one side of the story . 
Maybe if Gaddafi had let the media participate in Tripoli prior to its fall he would be in better standing now , although it is more likely he did n't want them to see the war crimes he was committing .

2011-09-11,"TRIPOLI\/OUTSIDE BANI WALID , Libya | Sun Sep 11 , 2011 6:45 pm EDT TRIPOLI\/OUTSIDE BANI WALID , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - - Libya 's new rulers said on Sunday their fighters were holding back an assault on one of the last bastions loyal to Muammar Gaddafi after fighting their way into the town and finding civilians in peril . 
Southern neighbor Niger said one of the fugitive former leader 's sons , Saadi Gaddafi , had turned up there after crossing the remote Sahara desert frontier . 
The National Transitional Council , which is trying to exert its control over the entire country three weeks after its fighters stormed Tripoli , said it plans to unveil a new , more inclusive government for the country in 7-10 days . 
It also said it had begun producing oil , Libya 's economic lifeblood , production of which had been all but halted throughout six months of civil war . 
In Tripoli , NTC fighters revealed they had captured Gaddafi 's foreign spy chief . 
The NTC says it will not declare Libya `` liberated '' until it has taken control of towns still in the hands of Gaddafi loyalists . 
It had given holdout towns a deadline of Saturday to surrender , and its fighters have been battling since Friday inside the town of Bani Walid . 
They said on Sunday they were meeting stiff resistance in the town 95 miles southeast of the capital and were also edging toward the ousted ruler 's birthplace Sirte . 
`` We are inside Bani Walid , we control big chunks of the city . 
There are still pockets of resistance , '' one fighter named Sabhil Warfalli said as he drove away from the front line in the town 95 miles southeast of Tripoli . 
But the advance into the town seems to have stalled after heavy fighting . 
NTC spokesman Ahmed Bani told reporters the plan for Bani Walid for now was to wait . 
`` When our forces entered Bani Walid they found the brigades of Gaddafi using citizens as shields , '' he told reporters . 
He said Gaddafi fighters had put missile launchers on the roofs of houses with civilian families inside , making it impossible for NTC forces or their allied NATO war planes to strike . 
Fighters said they were meeting fiercer resistance than expected in the town . 
Ambulances were rushing between the front and field hospitals . 
A man who lived in the town center was driving out in a car packed with his wife , some small children and assorted family members . 
`` There is no food . 
People are trying to bring us food and medicine but Gaddafi gangs turn them away , '' he said . 
The NTC has made a priority of hunting down Gaddafi and his seven sons . 
Mustafa Abdel Jalil , the NTC chairman , said Gaddafi is still a threat as long as he is at large . 
`` Gaddafi still has money and gold , '' he said . 
`` These are the fundamental things that will allow him to find men . '' 
The justice minister of Niger said Gaddafi 's son Saadi had been intercepted in a convoy after crossing the frontier , heading in the direction of the oasis town of Agadez . 
Two of Gaddafi 's other sons , Mohamed and Hannibal , and his only daughter Aisha have already obtained shelter in Algeria . 
Three sons remain at large -- Mutassim and Khamis who both run elite military units , and Saif al-Islam , Gaddafi 's one-time heir apparent who like his father is wanted for war crimes by the international court in the Hague . 
One son , Saif al-Arab , was reported killed during the war . 
Asked what Saadi Gaddafi 's status in the country was , Niger Justice Minister Marou Adamou said only that Niger would fulfill its humanitarian obligations . 
Washington and others have put pressure on neighboring states not to shelter Gaddafi or officials who are wanted for crimes . 
The NTC , based for months in the eastern city of Benghazi , faces the difficult task of winning the support of all Libyans , including fighters from towns and cities in the west who did the bulk of the fighting in the rapid advance on Tripoli . 
The interim government also has to deliver on promises to quickly restart an economy frozen by international sanctions , the halt in oil production and an exodus of foreign worker . 
Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril announced the NTC would form a more inclusive interim government within 10 days . 
He said it had started to produce some oil on Saturday , but gave no details of where or how much . 
Inside the capital , Reuters reporters saw Bouzaid Dorda , a former prime minister who ran Gaddafi 's external spy service , held by a group of about 20 fighters under guard in a house in the capital 's Zenata district . 
A fighter said he would be handed over to the interim authorities later on Sunday . 
A tall , lanky figure in safari jacket and slip-on shoes , Dorda was sitting on a sofa and was not physically restrained but an armed guard sat beside him . 
He declined a request for an interview , but in response to an assertion by a fighter that he had killed people , he replied : `` Prove it . '' 
`` I am innocent until proven guilty . 
I am willing to be referred to the Libyan prosecutor general , '' he said . 
Visibly agitated , he added : `` You have to remember it was a regime already in existence . '' 
Bani Walid resident Khalifa Telisi , who had telephoned a family inside the town , said fighting was concentrated around the central market area , where Gaddafi forces were based . 
`` There is still resistance from the central market . 
All other parts of Bani Walid have been liberated , '' Telisi said . 
Inside the town , a pro-Gaddafi local radio station appealed for the city 's 100,000 people to fight to the death . 
`` We urge the people of Bani Walid to defend the city against the rats and armed gangs . 
Do n't back down . 
Fight to the death . 
We are waiting for you . 
You are just a bunch of gangsters . 
God is on our side , '' an announcer said . 
The language echoed turns of phrase used by Gaddafi in recent broadcasts . 
Gaddafi 's loyalists also control Sirte , which sits on the main east-west coastal highway , effectively cutting Libya in two . 
Advancing NTC troops said the front line was now about 90 km east of the city . 
Fighters were firing tanks and howitzers amid the sound of heavy machinegun fire and the roar of NATO warplanes overhead . 
`` There were clashes this morning and Gaddafi forces were firing Grad rockets , but we managed to advance a little bit and we will enter Sirte very soon , '' fighter Salah al-Shaery said . 
The United Nations says it is worried about the fate of civilians trapped inside the besieged pro-Gaddafi bastions . 
`` Our big concern right now is Sirte , where we are receiving reports that there 's no water and no electricity , '' U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told Reuters in an interview . 
She said the world body was also worried about the fate of sub-Saharan African migrants , who face revenge attacks as suspected mercenaries even though most are ordinary laborers . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
The only hope for the rag-tag rebels is for their masters in the UN\/NATO to apply their brutal scotch earth policy to bombard Qaddafi supporters and reduce entire cities to rubble . 
NATO do not really care about the tribes that want sovereignty , they need 100 % puppets . 
The rag-tags too are heartless , greedy and hungry to loot and revenge . 
NATO is itching for the oil\/gas wealth and are already squabbling about contracts . 
More greed and exploitation will show soon and all Libyans will realize what is in store with the kind of NATO regime they are tying to put in place-led by the NTC proxy group . 
The whole war fiasco was imposed on Libyans , the rebels are unpopular , backward and racists eliminating dark skinned people , the UN is just a club for the west or in the pockets of the west . 
UN means very little to the rest of the world in the current state of the world . 
Why is the U.S. helping to overthrow Ghadaffi ? 
He was doing a fine job of keeping his muslims in check . 
When he is gone , we will probably see another chaos-causing islamic state similar to Iran . 
Military wing of Libyan `` rebel '' movement has strong links to Al Qaeda . 
This wing already assassinated the more moderate civilian-minded rebel commander -LRB- Younis -RRB- . 
After 9\/11 Gaddafy collaborated with CIA and British intelligence to interrogate\/torture Libyan Al Qaeda suspects . 
These same former suspects helped overthrow Gaddafy and are now in charge of Tripoli militias and gangs . 
Assuming they are not totally innocent of those Al Qaeda suspicions , then they will likely try to use Libya as new Al Qaeda base , like Afghanistan used to be , armed with all the weapons they took as trophies from Gaddafy-regime army . 
From this base they could launch attacks on other Middle East countries , as well as Europe and USA . 
A fine pickle it could turn out to be .

Full Article Libyan forces push into Gaddafi bastion NORTH OF BANI WALID , Libya | Sun Sep 11 , 2011 9:57 pm IST NORTH OF BANI WALID , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan forces who have launched an assault on the last holdout towns of Muammar Gaddafi 's loyalists were still meeting resistance in one desert town on Sunday , and said they had edged towards the ousted ruler 's birthplace Sirte . 
`` We are inside Bani Walid , we control big chunks of the city . 
There are still pockets of resistance , '' one fighter named Sabhil Warfalli said as he drove away from the front line in the town 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- southeast of Tripoli . 
He said pro-Gaddafi forces were now concentrated in the central market area -- an account backed up by a resident named Khalifa Telisi who had telephoned a family in the town . 
`` There is still resistance from the central market . 
All other parts of Bani Walid have been liberated , '' Telisi said . 
`` Another revolutionary battalion is coming in from the south . 
Gaddafi forces are scattered . 
It is a matter of hours now . '' 
A pro-Gaddafi local radio station appealed for the city 's 100,000 people to fight to the death . 
`` We urge the people of Bani Walid to defend the city against the rats and armed gangs . 
Do n't back down . 
Fight to the death . 
We are waiting for you . 
You are just a bunch of gangsters . 
God is on our side , '' an announcer said in language that echoed that used by Gaddafi in recent broadcasts . 
Libya 's National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- is trying to capture Gaddafi 's last bastions and find the fugitive leader to assert its grip over the vast North African oil-producer and begin a countdown to elections and a new constitution . 
Gaddafi troops firing rockets and mortars have fought back against fighters trying to push into Bani Walid for two days . 
`` There has been ferocious resistance from them at Bani Walid , '' Jalil al-Galal , an NTC spokesman in Tripoli said . 
The NTC sent experienced reinforcements to join the fight , but fighters said they were awaiting a go-ahead from NATO , whose warplanes hit Gaddafi positions in the area on Saturday . 
`` Yesterday we set up checkpoints in Bani Walid but had to leave after NATO told us to do so . 
Today we 're waiting for their green light to go back in again , '' said a 42-year-old fighter named Abdenabi Abdulrahman outside the town . 
NATO says it has no contacts with the NTC , but confirmed its aircraft had been in action the day before . 
Gaddafi 's loyalists also control Sirte , which sits on the main east-west coastal highway , effectively cutting Libya in two . 
Advancin NTC troops said the front line was now about 90 km east of the city . 
Fighters were firing tanks and howitzers amid the sound of heavy machinegun fire and the roar of NATO warplanes overheard . 
`` There were clashes this morning and Gaddafi forces were firing Grad rockets , but we managed to advance a little bit and we will enter Sirte very soon , '' said fighter Salah al-Shaery . 
The pro-Gaddafi towns still holding out , as well as the uncertain loyalties of the vast desert interior , undermine the NTC 's efforts to show it is firmly in control of the country . 
NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , a former Gaddafi justice minister who has run the council from the eastern city of Benghazi , arrived in Tripoli on Saturday for the first time since bands of anti-Gaddafi rebels captured it on Aug. 23 . 
`` Brotherhood and warmth -- that 's what we will depend on to build our future . 
We are not at a time of retribution , '' Abdel Jalil declared . 
`` This is the time of unity and liberation . '' 
The NTC has said it will complete its move to Tripoli this week , although previous timelines for this have slipped . 
Establishing a credible interim government in the capital would mark an important step for Libya , where regional and factional rivalries among forces united only by contempt for Gaddafi could trouble efforts to reshape the country . 
The NTC also promised to resume oil production , virtually stalled since the civil war began six months ago , within days . 
But Abdel Jalil said Libya could not yet be declared `` liberated '' from the man who ruled it for 42 years . 
`` Gaddafi still has money and gold , '' he said . 
`` These are the fundamental things that will allow him to find men . '' 
The NTC had given the main pro-Gaddafi towns -- Sirte , Bani Walid and the remote desert outpost of Sabha -- until Saturday to surrender or face attack . 
Fighting around Sirte and Bani Walid erupted a day before the deadline . 
Anti-Gaddafi fighters believe one or two of the ousted leader 's sons may be holed up in Bani Walid . 
Some NTC officials have even suggested Gaddafi might be there . 
Others say he may be hiding deeper in the Sahara . 
Several former Gaddafi officials and generals have fled across the vast desert to neighbouring Niger . 
The toppled leader 's wife and three of his children found sanctuary in Algeria last month . 
Some civilians managed to flee Bani Walid on Sunday . 
`` We live right in the center . 
We are leaving because we want to be on the side of the revolution , '' said a man in a car with his wife , children and other relatives . 
`` For six months I could n't get out . 
There is no food . 
People are trying to bring us food and medicine but Gaddafi gangs turn them away , '' he said , referring to efforts by civilians to bring supplies into the besieged town . 
The original plan was for local fighters to enter Bani Walid to reassure residents and to encourage Gaddafi fighters to lay down their weapons and stay indoors . 
But NTC officials , who first estimated they were facing only 150 Gaddafi loyalists , now say their opponents number about 1,000 after an influx of extra men from other Gaddafi strongholds such as Sirte and Sabha . 
`` Last night the enemy fired many Grad rockets and mortars . 
We were under a hail of Grads . 
We do n't know what we 're going to do now . 
I have to admit , they have more experience than us , '' said Mohammed Ibrahim , a local anti-Gaddafi fighter .

2011-09-14,"UNITED NATIONS | Wed Sep 14 , 2011 2:06 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain has circulated a draft resolution that would ease U.N. sanctions against Libya to members of the Security Council and hopes to vote on it this week , diplomats said on Wednesday . 
The draft would have the council begin lifting six-month-old punitive measures imposed on Libya when its former leader Muammar Gaddafi was overseeing a crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators across the country . 
According to the draft resolution , obtained by Reuters , the resolution would ask the 15-nation council to ease sanctions against Libya 's National Oil Corp and central bank to enable those two key institutions to start functioning . 
The draft would have the council declare `` its determination to ensure that assets frozen pursuant to -LRB- U.N. sanctions resolutions -RRB- shall as soon as possible be made available to and for the benefit of the people of Libya . '' 
The National Oil Corp would become free of sanctions , which should enable the oil-producing OPEC member to begin exporting crude more easily once the resolution is approved . 
But some of the sanctions on other firms would remain in place . 
Assets of the central bank , the Libyan Foreign Bank , Libyan Investment Authority , and the Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio that have been frozen abroad by U.N. member states are to remain frozen for the time being , unless they have been exempted from the freeze by the council 's sanctions committee . 
Such assets , the draft says , can only be released on the basis of a decision of the Security Council 's Libya sanctions committee , which one senior Security Council diplomat said has already unfrozen $ 16 billion of Libyan assets to date . 
The council diplomat described the easing as a `` progressive or controlled lifting of the asset freeze . '' 
Speaking on condition of anonymity , he added that Britain , the drafter of the resolution , hoped to put it to a vote by Friday . 
ARMS EMBARGO , NO-FLY ZONE REMAIN IN PLACE Libya 's frozen assets have been held by various governments over the last half year in compliance with the U.N. sanctions regime imposed in February and March . 
The draft resolution does not call for an end to the no-fly zone over the North African state or an end to NATO 's authorization to protect civilians . 
But it does call for an easing of the arms embargo to enable Libyan authorities and U.N. security officials to import weapons needed to maintain security . 
The draft resolution also follows recommendations from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who asked the council to establish a U.N. mission to help advise Libya 's transitional leadership on restoring public order and security and preparing for democratic elections . 
The initial order for a mission would be valid for three months . 
The mission would not include peacekeepers or U.N. police to help maintain order in the country . 
But the mission , which diplomats say would have up to 200 staff , would help the government promote human rights , the draft says . 
Little resistance to the resolution is expected in the council , diplomats say , since nearly all members have concluded that Gaddafi is effectively no longer in control of Libya . 
Russia and China , which worked hard to prevent the Security Council from waiving certain sanctions to aid the rebel forces during the Libyan civil war , are expected to support the resolution , diplomats say . 
Moscow and Beijing were highly critical of the U.N.-approved NATO intervention in Libya but both have recently recognized Libya 's National Transitional Council as the country 's legitimate government .

2011-09-14,"Analysis : Egyptian firms eye Libya but politics may be hurdle CAIRO | Wed Sep 14 , 2011 2:06 pm EDT CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Egyptians are eager to drum up business in Libya after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi , but countries which were swifter to embrace the rebels who seized power may have a head start in the race for deals . 
Egypt gave a lifeline to Gaddafi 's opponents based in eastern Libya by keeping the border open to flows of food and medical aid . 
But Cairo waited until the rebels fought their way to Gaddafi 's doorstep before officially recognizing them . 
Leaders of Libya 's National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- have publicly said they will favor companies from countries which did most to support the rebellion . 
That could put Western countries such as France , Britain and the United States , which swiftly backed the rebels , ahead in the queue for business . 
Arab states such as Qatar , which provided early diplomatic , material and military support , may also get better treatment . 
`` I consider the opinion of the Egyptian government respectable and responsible , '' the NTC 's delegate to the Arab League in Cairo , Abdel Moneim El Houni , told Reuters . 
`` I of course would have wished something else as a Libyan . '' 
Hani Soufrakis , a Libyan businessman living in Cairo , noted that Egyptian authorities allowed Libya 's opposition to operate in Egypt during the uprising , which was a big help to the rebels . 
But Gaddafi-linked businesses in Egypt , such as hotels and real estate projects , were also permitted to continue working with impunity , he added . 
`` They allowed Gaddafi to keep doing essentially what he wanted and his investments here in Egypt were largely untouched , '' Soufrakis said . 
`` It 's still Gaddafi 's men running them . '' 
Analysts believe the new Egyptian government was distracted from Libya by other policy challenges after the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak earlier in the year , or it may have wanted to avoid committing itself to the uncertain result of a conflict on its doorstep . 
Either way , said Ezzedin Choukri-Fishere , international relations professor at the American University in Cairo : `` Egypt kind of pretended nothing was happening in Libya . '' 
Trying to make up for lost time in building relations with Libya 's new government , Egypt said it was sending a high-level foreign ministry delegation to Libya days after Gaddafi fled into hiding in late August . 
Egyptian firms are already lining up . 
Among them is El Sewedy Electric , which has exported its cables to Libya since 1999 and agreed in 2003 to set up a $ 64 million factory in Tripoli , although the project has yet to be developed . 
Chief Executive Ahmed el-Sewedy told Reuters that Egypt 's government was supporting Egyptian firms , but he said they would find competition in Libya tough and could face a challenge getting into a market that many have not ventured into for years , if at all . 
`` We thought Egyptian companies would have a lot of work with Libya . 
But I 'm not sure . 
All the world is now focusing on Libya and most Egyptian companies have not been there in the last 10 years ... For the new companies to go ahead it will be possible , but not easy . '' 
He added that orders for his company from Libya , which had been put on hold during the civil war , would now go ahead . 
`` For our manufacturing project there , we have to discuss with the new government to see what they want to do . '' 
Other Egyptian companies cited by analysts as possible contenders for business are Orascom Telecom and Orascom Construction . 
Both have a reputation for drumming up business in the toughest of emerging markets . 
Libya took slightly over 4 percent of Egypt 's exports of about $ 25 billion last year , before the civil war , Egyptian media quoted trade ministry officials in Cairo as saying . 
Officials on both sides say there is scope for trade to rise . 
Although the war has ravaged Libya 's economy , reconstruction demand -- for building materials , vehicles , machinery and other products -- is expected to be substantial . 
It could emerge quickly ; foreign lenders such as the International Monetary Fund are offering to provide short-term financing to Libya , and in the medium term it can expect to begin using an estimated $ 150 billion of sovereign assets that were once controlled by Gaddafi and his inner circle , and are now frozen abroad . 
Before the war , petrodollars lured hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Egypt , a country of 80 million people , to find jobs in Libya on farms and in factories and to work as carpenters , plumbers and mechanics . 
Many fled during the fighting , but others stayed and more are likely to return as Libya rebuilds . 
Houni said Egypt had since March provided Libya with electricity to replace capacity destroyed by Gaddafi 's forces in the conflict , and that further cooperation in the area of power was being discussed . 
Egypt , which has government institutions that survived the uprising to overthrow Mubarak in February , might also offer expertise to a fellow Arab state seeking to rebuild institutions that are in disarray after Gaddafi 's ouster . 
Libyan officials say Egypt could provide teachers , doctors and consultants to help revamp education , the police force , utilities and infrastructure . 
Egyptian investment bank Beltone Financial , which set up an office in Libya before Gaddafi was overthrown , said the change of government would create business opportunities for it , because foreign investors would become more interested in the Libyan economy . 
`` We expect from our own perspective that there will be plenty of mergers and acquisitions by European and Gulf entities in the Libyan market , '' said Khalid Helal , managing director at Beltone Securities International . 
Foreigners were already interested before the rebellion in telecommunications , steel , cement and other assets in Libya . 
Beltone had been helping to manage planned initial public offers of shares by Libyan mobile phone firms Madar and Libyana , Helal said . 
But he added that Egyptian firms could not afford to wait to pursue such opportunities : `` We in Egypt should start yesterday , because we will be in severe competition with Asians and Gulf states . ''

Little resistance to the resolution is expected in the council , diplomats say , since nearly all members have concluded that Gaddafi is effectively no longer in control of Libya . 
Russia and China , which worked hard to prevent the Security Council from waiving certain sanctions to aid the rebel forces during the Libyan civil war , are expected to support the resolution , diplomats say . 
Moscow and Beijing were highly critical of the U.N.-approved NATO intervention in Libya but both have recently recognized Libya 's National Transitional Council as the country 's legitimate government . 
A nine-person U.N. General Assembly credentials committee decided on Wednesday to recommend that diplomats representing Libya 's National Transitional Council be accredited to the world body , a U.N. diplomat said . 
Libya 's U.N. ambassador , Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham , and his deputy , who formerly represented Gaddafi but declared allegiance to the rebels in February , had been de-accredited by the United Nations at the request of the Gaddafi government . 
Diplomats said the General Assembly was likely to accept the committee 's recommendation on Friday . 
That is normally done by consensus , but several left-wing Latin American countries that had close ties with Gaddafi could force a vote , which they would likely lose , diplomats said . 
A U.N. official said Shalgham was expected to be reinstated in his post .

2011-09-15,"Thu , Sep 15 10:57 AM BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Surges in Brent crude oil for immediate delivery that since May have hit the market shortly before monthly futures contracts expire are based on tight supplies and are likely to subside as Libyan oil comes back on the market . 
Such surges have become a regular feature of the market due to reduced supplies of oil related to Brent futures and the linked dated Brent physical market . 
They may also have been exaggerated by the popularity of trading the prompt spread . 
Brent crude futures for October delivery on Wednesday traded at a premium of as much as $ 2.83 a barrel to the November contract , the highest so-called backwardation since June 15 . 
The October contact expires on Thursday . 
`` Dated Brent is very well bid , and there seems to be less Forties cargoes coming on board all the time , '' said Rob Montefusco , a trader at Sucden Financial . 
`` I think it 's more a bit of a play at the moment of traders on the dated side . '' 
Analysts and traders say the trend is likely to diminish as the supply of Brent-related crude becomes more comfortable due to a restart of shipments in Libya and to hopes North Sea output will recover after months of underperformance . 
Libya , whose production was virtually halted by the civil war , is already restarting supplies . 
Libya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company said on Tuesday that production from the eastern oilfield of Sarir had reached 160,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- . 
Christophe Barret , an analyst at Credit Agricole , cited the weaker prices of Brent for delivery in later months as evidence that the strength of the spread will not persist . 
`` Later on , we will have much more relaxed balances , and that 's why you have prices that are coming down further down the curve , '' he said . 
`` I think there is real pressure on the market because of the loss of Libyan supply , '' he said of the spread at present . 
Previous spikes in the spread this year have peaked on contract expiries , such as on July 14 , June 15 and May 16 . 
Supply of Forties , the crude that usually sets the price of dated Brent , began to underperform noticeably in May because of problems at Nexen 's -LRB- NXY . 
TO -RRB- Buzzard field , which delayed shipments and supported prices . 
Delays have persisted into September , and in October less Forties is scheduled to load than in September . 
Forties ' premium to dated Brent hit $ 1.80 a barrel last week , the highest in more than three years . 
Olivier Jakob , analyst at Petromatrix , said there were a number of reasons for volatility in the Brent spread before expiries , including the fact it is a financially settled contract , developments in fundamentals and the reinforcing effect of trading . 
`` The physical premiums have been very strong , so it does justify a backwardation in Brent . 
Now should that backwardation be a dollar , two dollars , that is always a bit difficult to fully assess , '' he said . 
`` What the traders do can also be part of it . 
It 's a bit of a micro-market , so when you have some small imbalances , it will be traders ' job to trade around it . '' 
Montefusco of Sucden said the strength of the prompt spread could be difficult to repeat in coming months as supplies increase . 
`` It 's very well bid now , but hopefully going forward we 'll have a bit more oil around , '' he said . 
`` I think they are trying to get it out of the way now before we start getting this other oil coming back . ''

Full Article U.N. Security Council eases sanctions on Libya UNITED NATIONS | Sat Sep 17 , 2011 8:24 am IST UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.N. Security Council on Friday eased sanctions on Libya , including on its national oil company and central bank , to enable key institutions to recover after rebels won a civil war . 
The 15-nation council voted unanimously for a resolution that also establishes a U.N. mission in Libya to help the North African nation get back on its feet after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi . 
The resolution begins lifting punitive measures imposed on the oil-exporting country six months ago when Gaddafi was overseeing a crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators . 
Despite arguments among council members since then over the application of previous resolutions , especially NATO 's bombing of Gaddafi 's forces , the council came together after Libya 's former rebels established control over most of the country . 
In Friday 's resolution , the council declared `` its determination to ensure that assets frozen pursuant to -LRB- U.N. sanctions resolutions -RRB- shall as soon as possible be made available to and for the benefit of the people of Libya . '' 
Earlier on Friday , the U.N. General Assembly approved a Libyan request to accredit envoys of the country 's interim government as Tripoli 's sole representatives at the world body , effectively recognizing the National Transitional Council . 
Both actions `` make clear the international community 's determination to support the new Libyan authorities , and the Libyan people , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement . 
The Security Council resolution lifts all sanctions against the Libyan National Oil Corp and Zueitina Oil Co as part of what British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said was an effort to `` help kick-start Libya 's economy and encourage economic self-sufficiency . '' 
The British-drafted text also partly eases sanctions on the central bank and other Libyan institutions , although special approval by the Security Council 's Libya sanctions committee will still be needed to unfreeze their seized assets . 
The committee has already authorized the emergency unfreezing of some $ 16 billion of Libyan assets , held mainly by Western countries , Security Council diplomats say . 
But some measures are being kept `` to ensure that previously frozen funds are released in a transparent and responsible way as the situation normalizes and the transition proceeds , '' U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice told the council . 
Diplomats said one problem with immediately unfreezing all assets was confusion in some cases about exactly who would be able to benefit from them . 
An arms embargo will remain in place , but Libya 's interim government and the United Nations will be allowed to import light weapons to maintain security . 
The resolution establishes a U.N. mission in Libya , which diplomats say will consist of up to 200 people in an initial three-month phase to help the government with a post-conflict transition . 
Their tasks are expected to include police training and electoral assistance , U.N. officials say . 
The resolution does not call , however , for the deployment of peacekeepers or police as part of the new U.N. Support Mission in Libya . 
Nor does it call for an end to the no-fly zone a March resolution imposed over the country , although diplomats say Libyan civil airliners will be allowed to fly provided they notify monitors of their flight plans . 
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin , a prominent critic of NATO 's air campaign in Libya , called for the prompt lifting of the no-fly-zone and also voiced concerns about human rights violations in Libya . 
`` It 's becoming increasingly clear that crimes were being committed by all parties to the conflict , '' he said . 
The National Transitional Council was represented at the Security Council meeting by Ibrahim Dabbashi , Libya 's deputy U.N. ambassador whose defection to the rebels in February inspired dozens of his country 's diplomats worldwide to denounce Gaddafi . 
`` A period of terror , of denial of freedom and violation of human rights has now come to an end for the Libyan people , '' Dabbashi told the council . 
He said Libya was the first instance of the much-quoted but seldom-applied U.N. `` responsibility to protect '' principle , `` which was done in a reasonable manner , which saved the lives of thousands of Libyans and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Libya . ''

2011-09-18,"BENGHAZI\/BANI WALID , Libya | Sun Sep 18 , 2011 7:26 pm EDT BENGHAZI\/BANI WALID , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's interim leaders failed to agree a new cabinet on Sunday and the forces that forced Muammar Gaddafi from power remained bogged down in fighting with troops loyal to the former ruler . 
Interim government forces fled in chaos from the town of Bani Walid and pulled back from Sirte after yet more failed attempts to storm Gaddafi 's final bastions and take control of the entire country . 
The political and military problems underscored how hard it would be to restore stability to Libya after Gaddafi was driven out of Tripoli last month . 
The former rebels ' executive committee , or cabinet , was dissolved last month . 
A new committee , to include officials responsible for defense and interior affairs , was supposed to be appointed by interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril on Sunday . 
But the talks broke down when his proposals did not receive full backing from all current members . 
`` We had an advisory meeting with the NTC in order to form a new cabinet . 
We have agreed on a number of portfolios . 
We still have more portfolios to be discussed , '' Jibril told reporters through a translator at a news conference on Sunday . 
A list of the approved ministries was not available , though sources familiar with the negotiations said that the position of Jibril himself was a sticking point during the talks . 
There was also disagreement about whether it is necessary to form a transitional government before the declaration of `` liberation '' - a concept that appears to include the capture of Gaddafi and the defeat of his loyalists who still hold three key towns . 
The NTC has drawn up a road map setting out plans for a new constitution and elections over a 20-month period , which should start once that declaration is made . 
With political negotiations bogged down , Sunday 's failed attempt to take Bani Walid set off angry recriminations among the attackers , who must capture the town and Gaddafi 's birthplace Sirte before they can declare Libya `` liberated '' . 
Since taking Tripoli last month , National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- fighters have tried several times to storm Bani Walid , 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- southeast of the capital , only to retreat under heavy fire and in disorder . 
NTC fighters said they had planned for tanks and pickup trucks with anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers to lead Sunday 's attack , but foot soldiers had piled in first . 
`` There is a lack of organization so far . 
Infantry men are running in all directions , '' said Zakaria Tuham , a senior fighter with a Tripoli-based unit . 
`` Our commanders had been told that heavy artillery units had already gone ahead , but when we advanced into Bani Walid they were nowhere to be seen . 
`` Gaddafi forces were hitting us heavily with rockets and mortars , so we have pulled out . '' 
A Reuters reporter saw fighters withdraw around two km -LRB- more than a mile -RRB- after they had stormed into the town . 
NATO planes circled above the town later on Sunday and loud explosions were heard from the center , though it was not clear whether the planes had attacked . 
Anti-Gaddafi fighters from Bani Walid blamed comrades from elsewhere in Libya for being unwilling to coordinate . 
Those from elsewhere accused some local fighters of being traitors and passing information to Gaddafi loyalists . 
`` Commanders who are from the Warfalla tribe , they tell us one thing and then commanders from the other cities say something else . 
We do not understand anything , '' said pro-NTC fighter Mohamed Saleh . 
Some fighters openly disobeyed orders . 
In one incident , an officer from Bani Walid was heckled by troops from Tripoli after he tried to order them to stop randomly shooting in the air as they celebrated seizing a mortar from Gaddafi forces . 
`` You are not my boss . 
Do n't tell me what to do , '' one of the Tripoli fighters snapped back at him . 
Shells whistled above anti-Gaddafi positions and exploded across the desert valley as invisible snipers sprayed bullets from Bani Walid 's rooftops and smoke rose above the town . 
NTC fighters helped some families leave the town , driving them out in military trucks . 
`` The past two weeks have been awful but last night was particularly bad , '' said Zamzam al-Taher , a 38-year-old mother of four . 
`` We have been trapped here without a car and with no food . 
Snipers are everywhere . '' 
NTC forces and NATO warplanes also attacked Sirte , Gaddafi 's birthplace . 
Fighters launched rockets from the city 's southern entrance and traded fire with Gaddafi loyalists holed up in a conference center . 
`` The situation is very dangerous . 
There are so many snipers and all the types of weapons you can imagine , '' said fighter Mohamed Abdullah as rockets whooshed through the air and black smoke rose above the city . 
As in many episodes during Libya 's conflict , the front lines at Sirte and Bani Walid have moved back and forth , with shows of bravado crumbling in the reality of battle . 
An incoming shell landed within 200 meters of NTC-held lines , only to be met with return fire from NTC fighters shouting `` Allahu Akbar ! '' 
-LRB- God is greatest -RRB- . 
Speaking against the roar of NATO jets overhead , one anti-Gaddafi fighter at Sirte , Mahmoud Othman , said his men were helping families who had fled ahead of the next assault . 
`` We do n't want any more bloodshed between us . 
But if the Gaddafa want more blood , we are ready , '' he said , referring to the deposed leader 's tribe . 
`` In the end we want Gaddafi . '' 
A spokesman for Gaddafi told Syrian-based Arrai TV on Sunday that 17 `` mercenaries '' , including what he called French and British `` technical experts '' had been captured in Bani Walid . 
It was not immediately possible to verify the report . 
NATO , French and British officials had on Saturday denied a report by Arrai TV that NATO troops had been captured by Gaddafi loyalists . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
If the US had merely baldly stated that it desired a regime change and control over the Libyan oilfields , and then invaded forthwith , that would have truly spared civilian casualties . 
Instead , we have another UN `` police action '' civil war with all the inhuman brutality that entails ... The problem here is that we have become desensitized as a people to this . 
Daily we have a gawking , whorish media smilingly and mawkishly retailing of innocents killed in drive by drug gang warfare here at home . 
So why should we give pause when we are told of a young girl killed in her backyard in Libya by a stray bullet that one of the rebels shot into the air in celebration . 
The deceit of this charade is nothing less than disgusting , unless , of course , you have been lulled and stupefied like so many among us . 
Take a gander , if you dare , at Goya 's horrors of war etchings , look in the mirror and then ask yourself who is looking back ? 
An army that is supposedly at 15 % of its original force -LRB- according to NATO -RRB- is holding off attacks from the air and from the ground . 
As long as the NTC and their foreign backers do n't accept fact that the Gaddafi loyalists have the support and help of the people , Libya will continue in chaos . 
No future for anyone .

2011-09-18,"TRIPOLI | Sun Sep 18 , 2011 1:17 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Tripoli 's port is back to near-normal business less than a month after the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi , authorities said on Sunday , with the Libyan capital 's international airport also ready to operate flights . 
As cranes lifted containers and sacks of goods onto the docks , and trucks manoeuvred into position to be loaded , port interim manager Abddel Hakim al-Ghazawi told Reuters the installation was safe and called on insurance companies to reduce fees related to use of the facility . 
`` Tripoli 's sea port is totally secure . 
There is nothing that can be an obstacle for the arrival of goods and ships , '' he said . 
`` Already some companies have started to send ships , '' he said , adding goods were being unloaded efficiently and 85-90 percent of the port was functioning . 
The European Union lifted sanctions on Libyan ports , oil firms and banks on September 2 to try and help the country 's transition from four decades of Gaddafi 's rule . 
Mukhtar al-Akhdar , a military official in charge of the airport , told Reuters damage caused during the uprising has been repaired , the facility was `` totally secure '' and he hoped it would start operations by Thursday . 
`` The airport is ready for airplanes to arrive and depart , '' he said . 
`` We had to do some maintenance on the runway due to the shelling of the -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- militia , which is now fixed . 
We cleared the remains of the planes that were destroyed by the militia . '' 
Diplomats say Libyan civil airliners and flights carrying official delegations are allowed to fly provided they notify monitors of their flight plans in order to avoid NATO attack . 
The U.N. Security Council resolution imposed in March a no-fly zone for civilian flights over the country as part of international efforts to protect anti-government protesters under attack from Gaddafi loyalists . 
Libyan Arab Airlines and the ports of Tripoli , Al Khoms , Brega , Ras Lanuf , Zawiyah and Zuara were among the 28 Libyan entities , along with oil firms and banks , to be freed from restrictions on September 2 . 
The formal lifting of the sanctions came a day after world powers meeting in Paris freed up billions of dollars to help Libya 's new rulers rebuild the nation after 42 years of Gaddafi 's rule and six months of civil war . 
The port had been a focal point in the conflict , which has continued in the towns of Bani Walid and Sirte as interim government forces try to storm the final bastions held by fighters loyal to Gaddafi . 
In May , NATO sank eight Libyan warships and intercepted a fuel tanker it believed was heading for the military in the city in a marked escalation of its bombing campaign in Libya . 
After the strikes , Libyan officials took journalists to the city 's port where a small ship spewed smoke and flames . 
In late August , as anti-Gaddafi fighters overran the capital , they told a rescue ship not to dock at the port because it was too risky -- leaving thousands of foreigners stranded at their embassies waiting for the all clear to leave .

2011-09-19,"BANI WALID\/SIRTE , Libya | Mon Sep 19 , 2011 3:38 pm EDT BANI WALID\/SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's interim government said on Monday its forces had seized the airport and fort in Sabha , one of the last strongholds of forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi which also controls the main route south out of Libya . 
`` Our forces are there in the airport and in the castle ... Our flags are flying there , '' Ahmed Bani , a military spokesman for the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , told a news conference in Tripoli . 
It was not possible to obtain independent confirmation . 
Sabha , 770 km -LRB- 480 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli and overlooked by an old fort built by Libya 's former Italian colonial rulers , controls the main trail south to neighboring Niger , an escape route used by members of Gaddafi 's entourage . 
Any advance on the town , which is still used as a military base , would be an important boost for government forces who are struggling to oust Gaddafi loyalists from the towns of Bani Walid and Sirte as well as to contain disunity in their ranks . 
Bani also denied an assertion by Gaddafi 's spokesman that his forces had captured 17 British and French nationals in the fight for Bani Walid . 
`` There are no British or French prisoners '' in the town , Bani said . 
The claim by Gaddafi 's spokesman Moussa Ibrahim that foreign security personnel had been captured could not be verified and no immediate proof was presented . 
`` A group was captured in Bani Walid consisting of 17 mercenaries . 
They are technical experts and they include consultative officers , '' Gaddafi spokesman Ibrahim said on Syria-based Arrai television , which has backed Gaddafi . 
`` Most of them are French , one of them is from an Asian country that has not been identified , two English people and one Qatari . '' 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said there were `` no French mercenaries in Libya , '' while the British foreign office said it had no information about whether the report was true . 
Qatar 's foreign ministry was not available for comment . 
NATO , which is staging air strikes on Gaddafi loyalist positions , says it has no troops on the ground in Libya . 
Western nations have sent special forces in the past , and media have reported that private security firms have aided anti-Gaddafi forces in training , target ting and with leadership . 
Gulf Arab states have also sent trainers and arms . 
Among the confirmed sightings of foreign security personnel in Libya during the conflict , the head of a French security firm was shot dead at a checkpoint in Benghazi in May , and British special forces troops were held for three days by rebels in March while escorting a spy trying to make contacts . 
The claim about the capture of foreign security personnel added to confusion about the situation in Libya nearly a month after Gaddafi was driven from power . 
The former leader 's loyalist holdouts have beaten back repeated assaults by National Transitional Council forces at Bani Walid and Gaddafi 's home city of Sirte . 
NTC fighters have been sent fleeing in disarray after failing to storm Gaddafi bastions . 
The NTC , still based in the eastern city of Benghazi , has faced questions about whether it can unify a country divided on tribal and local lines . 
A long-promised attempt to set up a more inclusive interim government fell apart overnight . 
On Monday , NTC forces were unable to approach the northern gate of Bani Walid , 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- southeast of Tripoli , to attack the town because of heavy gunfire from Gaddafi loyalists . 
`` There is a lack of organization so far . 
Infantrymen are running in all directions , '' said Zakaria Tuham , a senior fighter with a Tripoli-based unit . 
Many fighters spoke of tension between units drawn from Bani Walid itself and those from other parts of the country . 
Some fighters openly disobeyed orders . 
In one incident , an officer from Bani Walid was heckled by troops from Tripoli after he tried to order them to stop shooting in the air . 
NTC forces and NATO warplanes also attacked Sirte , Gaddafi 's birthplace , where assaults have been repelled . 
Hundreds of families were fleeing the city on Monday as NTC forces rolled up with huge rocket launchers and artillery . 
Humanitarian groups have voiced alarm at reported conditions in the besieged coastal city . 
`` There 's no electricity , no phone coverage . 
Nothing , '' resident Ibrahim Ramadan said , standing by a car packed with his family at a checkpoint . 
Interim government forces were handing out juice to civilians and rifling through their belongings to search for weapons . 
Residents said homes had been destroyed and cars smashed to pieces as disorder spread through the city . 
`` People are fed up . 
There are explosions going off everywhere and you do n't know where the bullets will come from next , '' said Abubakr , a resident making his way out of the city . 
`` Look at this , '' he said , pointing to a bullet hole in his windshield . 
`` Bullets are coming down from above . 
People are just firing randomly . '' 
In Benghazi , interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril failed to name a new cabinet on Sunday when his proposals did not receive full backing from all current members . 
`` We have agreed on a number of portfolios . 
We still have more portfolios to be discussed , '' Jibril told reporters at a news conference on Sunday . 
Sources familiar with the negotiations said Jibril 's own role had been a sticking point . 
There was also disagreement about whether it was right to form a transitional government before declaring Libya `` liberated , '' which NTC officials say can only happen when all Gaddafi loyalists are defeated . 
The political infighting reveals some of the fractures in an alliance that was united in civil war by hatred of Gaddafi but remains split among pro-Western liberals , underground Islamist guerrillas and defectors from Gaddafi 's government . 
The NTC has its roots in Libya 's east , but most of the militiamen who finally succeeded in driving Gaddafi out of Tripoli are from towns in the west . 
Fighters are organized by home town into units with little overall coordination . 
Nevertheless , many Libyans say they can tolerate confusion among the new rulers as the price of being rid of Gaddafi , who crushed all opposition during four decades of rule . 
`` The delay in the new government is n't important ... We need time to recover , '' engineer Mustafa Saab bin Ragheb told Reuters in Tripoli 's main Martyrs ' Square , where traffic police in crisply pressed which uniforms took up patrols on Monday for the first time since Gaddafi 's fall . 
`` Look , we finally got rid of that bloody monkey . 
We are better than before . 
We will hang him and his sons , and then we can breathe freely . 
It 's too early for politics . '' 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
If you ca n't love your neighbors , and get their love , what 's the point . 
Nato countries have become the savages they claim to be attacking and killing in Libya . 
It 's all about oil and has little to do with saving lives and implementing European and American\/Canadian style democracy .

2011-09-22,"\* Pre-uprising levels could take 18-36 months to reach \* Mines , booby traps likely to slow progress \* Foreign staff , industry expertise hard to lure back LONDON , Sept 22 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil , the lifeblood of the battered Libyan economy , is starting to trickle onto the world market as the country recovers from seven months of fighting , but it could take as long as three years to get back to pre-war output levels , analysts say . 
Before the conflict , Libya turned out 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of high quality crude and the loss of that oil has helped keep oil prices at historically high levels with Brent crude above $ 100 per barrel for most of this year . 
Libyan officials have said some oil output is likely to come back quickly and analysts say some fields will return to production much faster than expected . 
But Libya 's Sirte Basin , which holds about 80 percent of Libya 's proven oil reserves and accounted for the majority production before the war , could be more difficult to revive , according to John Hamilton , director at energy market consultancy Cross Border Information . 
Troops loyal to former leader Muammar Gaddafi controlled the Sirte Basin for much of the uprising and some areas could be hazardous , he said . 
`` It could take a lot of time to clear the mine fields and remove booby traps from installations in that area as Gaddafi held onto it for most of the war , '' he said . 
`` That 's where there could be nasty surprises . '' 
`` There will be a long , slow incremental process of building up to where they ought to be , and that could take much longer than people hope . 
It could be three years if it 's tough . '' 
Industry players are optimistic that the taps will be easy enough to turn back on in some oilfields . 
The chief executive of Austrian energy group OMV told Reuters it would take 12-18 months for oil production in Libya to get back to pre-war levels . 
Christopher Bellew , broker at Jefferies Bache said many in the market believed Libyan oil could come back on track even more quickly than this . 
`` In general , oil tends to come on stream quicker than people expect because there 's such a strong economic incentive to see the oil flowing , '' Bellew said . 
`` But there are the unknowns on whether civil war will continue and whether there will be attacks on instillations . '' 
While production has started at various oilfields , and tenders for sales of some oil have been submitted , there has been little significant volume of crude exported since the National Transitional Council took power . 
The way in which the first cargo was brought to market highlights the pitfalls for getting crude to world markets . 
Libya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- Agoco -RRB- filled a cargo which failed to attract buyers because of confusion over quality , traders said this week . 
Trading house Vitol re-offered the oil on Thursday . 
And a lack of experience leading to errors and slow progress in getting oilfields and refineries back up to scratch will likely be a theme that keeps a brake on progress as Libya struggles to attract back people with appropriate expertise . 
`` It will need tens of thousands of people to return , such as oil engineers from places like China and India , '' said Samuel Ciszuk , senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy . 
`` Many will have left Libya in difficult circumstances , and may not want to go back . '' 
And while Libya post war -- at least so far -- looks to be in much better shape than Iraq , which was traumatised for years by sectarian violence , there are still plenty of obstacles in the way of a steady flow of oil . 
Oil companies that had significant operations have said they are unwilling to send staff back to fields that they operated before the hostilities erupted because they still see the situation as too unsafe and volatile . 
French oil major Total said on Monday that it was not planning to transport any Libyan crude oil for now . 
And even when companies are confident their staff will be safe , poor quality infrastructure will slow progress . 
`` There was not that much damage -LRB- caused by the fighting -RRB- , but the equipment was in a bad state before the war after decades of under-investment and mismanagement , '' Ciszuk said .

Full Article Gaddafi 's ex-premier jailed after fleeing Libya TRIPOLI | Thu Sep 22 , 2011 11:38 pm IST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's neighbor Tunisia jailed Muammar Gaddafi 's former prime minister on Thursday , and Libya 's new rulers said they were tightening their grip on the desert towns where Gaddafi himself may be hiding . 
In the highest profile detention of a Gaddafi associate to date , a Tunisian court sentenced ex-prime minister Al Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi to six months in jail on charges of illegally entering the country on Wednesday evening . 
`` Al-Mahmoudi was arrested yesterday evening , '' a Tunisian Interior Ministry official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters . '' 
-LRB- He -RRB- was arrested because he entered Tunisian territory illegally ... He did not have an entry stamp in his passport . '' 
The justice minister in Libya 's new government said Tripoli would request that the former prime minister be extradited to stand trial in Libya . 
`` Baghdadi directly oversaw the operations which had to do with the killings of Libyans , '' the minister , Mohammed al-Alagi , said on Al Arabiya television station . 
The National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , Libya 's de facto government since Gaddafi was swept from the capital last month , has been anxious to show that it can establish firm control over a country riven by tribal and regional rivalries . 
The new government said it was consolidating its grip on Sabha and other oasis towns in the far south of the country which had sided with Gaddafi . 
`` Our revolutionaries are controlling 100 percent of Sabha city , although there are some pockets of resistance by snipers , '' NTC military spokesman Ahmed Bani told reporters in the capital , Tripoli . 
`` This resistance is hopeless ... They know very well that at the end of the day they will show the white flag or they will die . 
They are fighting for themselves , not for the tyrant , '' he said , referring to Gaddafi . 
Until now some parts of Sabha , the traditional base for Gaddafi 's own tribe about 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , had been occupied by fighters loyal to him . 
The council says its forces have now also taken control of Jufra , to the north-east of Sabha , and the nearby oasis towns of Sokna , Waddan , and Houn . 
The NTC official said the manhunt for Gaddafi , in hiding for weeks though he occasionally issues defiant audio messages , was drawing closer to its target . 
`` There is no whole tribe or city on Gaddafi 's side , '' said Bani . 
`` I 'm asking everyone in the south who has any news about the tyrant or his loyalists ... to notify the legal bodies about them . '' 
`` We are doing our best looking for the tyrant . 
There is some news here and there that he ran away from Sabha to another place but it can not be confirmed . '' 
In Tripoli on Thursday , the U.S. ambassador returned to work after a hiatus caused by the civil war , and predicted a quick end to the fighting . 
`` I think it is a matter of time -LRB- for -RRB- Gaddafi and his remaining loyalists . 
Their resistance is finished , '' Ambassador Gene Cretz told reporters at a ceremony to mark the re-opening of the U.S. mission . 
Libya 's interim government received a diplomatic boost when its neighbor Algeria recognized the NTC as the country 's legitimate representative , according to a report broadcast by Al Arabiya . 
Algeria was the last of Libya 's neighbors to grant recognition , and the two sides have for months been trading allegations . 
The NTC accused Algiers of abetting Gaddafi in the civil war , and Algeria said it was worried the new government was not firm enough on the threat from Islamist militants . 
Western security officials say good relations between Libya and Algeria are vital if they are to keep a lid on al Qaeda 's north African branch , which has kidnapped foreigners and attacked Western targets in the region . 
The country 's new rulers were faring less well on the battlefield , aside from advances in the far south . 
In the two biggest towns where Gaddafi loyalists are still holding out , Sirte and Bani Walid , the NTC 's offensive has been chaotic , raising fresh questions about the council 's ability to run the oil exporting country effectively . 
Despite support from NATO warplanes , government forces have struggled to capture Sirte , Muammar Gaddafi 's hometown and the biggest of the towns still outside their control . 
It is a thorny task because the sympathies of many residents lie with Gaddafi . 
The city typifies the challenges the NTC faces in reconciling the significant parts of the country that have tribal loyalties to Gaddafi or did not support the revolution . 
A spokesman for Gaddafi told Reuters on Thursday that NATO air strikes and interim government forces ' shelling of Sirte were killing civilians . 
`` Between yesterday and this morning , 151 civilians were killed inside their homes as the Grad rockets and other explosives fell upon their heads , '' Moussa Ibrahim said in a satellite phone call to Reuters from an undisclosed location . 
His claims could not be verified as journalists are unable to reach the city . 
NATO comment was not immediately available . 
There was a counter-claim from rebel fighters near Sirte , and from residents fleeting the city , who said that pro-Gaddafi forces had been executing people suspected of sympathising with the NTC forces . 
An NTC commander on the outskirts of Sirte , who gave his name as Saleh , showed Reuters a handwritten list of families whose members were said to have been executed in Sirte . 
`` One man , they cut him like this , '' the commander said , dragging his finger from the ends of his mouth across his cheeks . 
`` Another , they cut his lips . '' 
On the Western outskirts of Sirte on Thursday there was little fighting , and dozens of civilians poured out of the city through anti-Gaddafi checkpoints . 
Over on the eastern side of the city , NTC forces came under heavy artillery fire . 
One fighter there said pro-Gaddafi artillery batteries appeared to have found the range of the NTC tanks , positioned more than 50 km east of Sirte , and were targeting them . 
`` There has been heavy shelling from Gaddafi forces , '' said Adel Al-Tarhouni , an anti-Gaddafi fighter in the village of Sultana , which came under artillery attack . 
`` I was able to see palm trees cut from the top by the shrapnel . '' 
North of Bani Walid , NTC military forces brought forward tanks and Grad rocket launchers in preparation for a renewed attempt to take the town . 
It was not clear when that attack might begin . 
Later in the day , a Reuters reporter near the town said fighting had resumed after a lull , though it did not appear to be an all-out assault . 
Gaddafi loyalists were firing shells at NTC positions on the edge of the town , and plumes of smoke could be seen rising up from within Bani Walid . 
The offensive there has been frustrated by stiff resistance from well-drilled loyalist fighters , and also by a lack of organization among the NTC forces . 
They operate in disparate units based on their home towns , with little overall command . 
On Wednesday , one fighter shot his own head off and killed another fighter while handling a rocket-propelled grenade in full view of a Reuters team . 
In another incident , a fighter wounded himself and another fighter after losing control of his machinegun . 
The nascent NTC national army has tried to bring order . 
If the NTC is unable to swiftly assert its control over the country and its own forces , it could embarrass Western leaders , especially France 's Nicolas Sarkozy and Britain 's David Cameron , who took a gamble by backing the anti-Gaddafi leadership . 
`` We have set up a unified operations room to unite all brigades , '' said brigade commander Omar Kabout . 
`` The purpose is to increase coordination and end all this chaos because many rebels have arrived without commanders . 
We need to put them into brigades and stop all this random shooting . '' 
But the message was not getting through to all the fighters , many of whom go into battle wearing flip-flop sandals , T-shirts and jeans and have no military training . 
`` We do n't take orders from the NTC . 
We listen only to our own commander , '' said Ziyad Al Khemri , a fighter from the town of Zawiyah , just west of Tripoli .

2011-09-26,"Mon Sep 26 , 2011 5:35 pm EDT CALGARY , Alberta -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Suncor Energy Inc said on Monday it is still unwilling to send its employees back to Libya even though its joint-venture partner there is getting ready to resume oil production in the strife-torn country . 
Kelli Stevens , a spokeswoman for Suncor , said the company has been in contact with partner Harouge Oil Operations `` and we 're aware of them taking steps to restart production '' . 
Stevens said Suncor is still concerned about the safety and security of its employees in Libya , and none of the expatriate employees it evacuated in February have yet returned . 
Oil production in Libya is resuming as forces of the National Transitional Council consolidate their control and sweep out Muammar Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists . 
Libya 's oil industry can restart without foreign firms , but analysts say a speedy return to prewar output of 1.6 million barrels per day will depend on their return . 
Suncor 's share of its exploration and production sharing agreements with Libya 's National Oil Co averaged about 35,000 bpd before civil war disrupted operations . 
It picked up the fields in the Sirte Basin of Libya in its 2010 acquisition of Petro-Canada . 
The company wrote down the value of the operations in July by C$ 514 million -LRB- $ 500 million -RRB- . 
The book value is now about C$ 400 million . 
Suncor shares were up 51 Canadian cents , or 2 percent , at C$ 26.83 by late morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange .

2011-09-26,"\* Eni producing 31,900 bopd at Abu Attifel field \* Aims to ramp up Libya output in coming days \* Saras welcomes news , could restart own ops by year-end \* Eni shares up 1.4 percent -LRB- Releads , adds comments from analyst , Saras chairman -RRB- MILAN , Sept 26 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italy 's Eni has restarted oil production in Libya as the group moves to consolidate its position as the dominant foreign oil operator in the country and bolster flagging volume . 
The oil and gas group said in a statement on Monday it had restarted production in 15 Libyan wells in the Abu Attifel field , some 300 kilometres south of Benghazi . 
Production at the field is around 31,900 barrels of oil per day , it said . 
That compares to pre-civil war daily output of around 70,000 barrels . 
`` The foreign operators already present are starting operations as fast as possible , proving their existing contracts are not at risk , '' a Milan-based oil industry specialist said . 
Eni was the largest foreign oil producer in Libya before the civil war and is keen to mend relations with interim government leaders , after hesitant Italian support for the uprising in its early stages . 
Some analysts have expressed concern Eni could lose assets or opportunities in the long run if Rome 's lukewarm early support for the rebels triggers a backlash . 
In Libya since 1959 , Eni produced about 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010 . 
Its oil production contracts are in force until 2042 and gas contracts until 2047 . 
Eni 's adjusted net profit in the second quarter of this year fell 14 percent , hit by oil and gas disruption in Libya . 
Eni shares closed up 1.37 percent at 12.54 euros . 
Eni said on Monday that other wells in Abu Attifel would be reactivated in coming days to reach the volume required to fill the pipeline connecting the field to the Zuetina terminal . 
`` Things are clearly going better and faster than the pessimists thought , '' said Davide Tabarelli , head of energy think-tank Nomisma Energie . 
In August , Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said it would take six to 18 months to resume its oil production in Libya depending on the fields . 
France 's Total said on Friday production at its Al-Jurf offshore field in Libya had restarted , earlier than expected . 
`` There 's a lot of potential in Libya and I believe we could be looking to go back not just to production levels before the war but to the levels of more than 3 million barrels per day we had before Gaddafi came to power , '' Tabarelli said . 
Libya was producing 1.6 million barrels of oil per day before the uprising against leader Muammar Gaddafi began in February . 
The civil war caused foreign workers to flee and some oilfields and export terminals were damaged . 
Last Thursday , a senior source in the National Oil Corporation told Reuters that Libya 's oil production is set to reach 500,000 barrels per day by early October . 
Italian oil refiner Saras welcomed the news of Eni 's production resumption , and said it hoped to restart crude shipment operations with Libya before the end of the year . 
Before the Libyan conflict began Saras sourced about 35 percent of its crude shipments from Libya . 
Light sweet crude , easier to refine than other types and so difficult to replace , accounted for around 25 percent of Saras ' Libyan shipments . 
Half of this came from the Abu Attifel field .

SIRTE , Libya | Tue Sep 27 , 2011 6:47 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Intense sniper and artillery fire from forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi holed up in Sirte kept fighters with Libya 's new rulers at bay in the deposed leader 's hometown on Wednesday . 
Sirte , one of the last two bastions of support for Gaddafi , is encircled by forces with the interim National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- and under aerial attack from NATO . 
NTC fighters have been meeting stiff resistance from Gaddafi loyalists , who have managed to hang on to much of Sirte more than a month after the fall of the Libyan leader 's regime . 
Lack of coordination and divisions at the front have been hampering their attempts to capture Sirte and Bani Walid , which lies 180 km -LRB- 110 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli . 
A commander leading the attack on Sirte said on Tuesday he was in talks with elders inside the city about a truce , but the head of another anti-Gaddafi unit rejected negotiations . 
There were clashes at a roundabout 2 km -LRB- 1.5 miles -RRB- east of the center of Sirte , where anti-Gaddafi fighters were pinned down for a second day by sniper and artillery fire . 
Forces with the new government brought in two tanks and trucks carrying infantry to try to break through . 
Snipers , though , held up the advance , forcing the attackers to take cover behind metal shipping containers . 
Medical workers at a hospital in Ras Lanuf , which lies 220 km -LRB- 137 miles -RRB- east of Sirte , said they had received the bodies of six NTC fighters killed in fighting on the city 's eastern front . 
Some 45 fighters were wounded , many from sniper fire . 
While the fighting continues , humanitarian organizations have expressed alarm at the worsening situation in Sirte . 
`` Our main worry is the people being displaced because of the fighting , '' said Jafar Vishtawi , a delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- , near Sirte . 
Taking Sirte , 450 km east of Tripoli , would bring Libya 's new rulers closer to gaining control of the whole country , something still eluding them more than a month after their fighters seized the capital . 
It is likely some members of Gaddafi 's family are in Sirte but there is no information about the location of the former ruler himself . 
He is the subject of an Interpol arrest warrant . 
A Syria-based television station that has been broadcasting audio speeches by Gaddafi , reported on Tuesday that the toppled leader had addressed his supporters and urged them to fight in a speech broadcast on a local radio station in Bani Walid . 
The report by Arrai television could not be independently verified . 
Arrai also broadcast footage of what it said was Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam , dated September 20 , rallying his forces at an unidentified location . 
`` This land is the land of your forefathers . 
Do n't hand it over , '' Saif al-Islam , shouted to a crowd of followers . 
In neighboring Algeria , the government ordered members of Gaddafi 's family in exile there to stay out of politics after Gaddafi 's daughter Aisha angered the NTC by telling the media her father was still fighting to hold on to power . 
Aisha Gaddafi , her brothers Hannibal and Mohammed , their mother Safia and several other family members fled in August . 
In a separate development , a Tunisian court of appeal freed Gaddafi 's former Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi , who was sentenced to six months in jail last week after he was arrested near the North African country 's border with Algeria . 
Shortly after the ruling , a source at the Justice Ministry told Reuters that Tunisia had not received any request from the NTC to extradite al-Mahmoudi . 
Libya 's new rulers received an important boost when exports of crude oil -- the country 's only major source of revenue -- resumed for the first time in months . 
The head of Libya 's port authority said a cargo of crude oil had sailed on September 25 from the port of Marsa el Hariga , bound for Italy . 
It was only the third cargo to leave Libya since the rebellion against Gaddafi 's rule began in February . 
`` We are working hard to make everything run normally at the ports , '' Capt. Ramadan Boumadyan said in an interview . 
`` I think everything will be back to normal in a month 's time . ''

Extending a truce will only prolong the conflict . 
And why would the rebels give a truce so the regime 's fighters so they can regroup .

2011-09-28,"LONDON | Wed Sep 28 , 2011 10:58 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As Syrian army defectors begin launching attacks on government forces , Syria 's largely peaceful rebellion appears in danger of descending into a sectarian civil war with wider regional consequences . 
Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday attempted to wrest control of a central town from military forces that had gone over to the opposition , whilst in other towns there were also reports of fighters coming together . 
Details were far from clear and diplomats and other sources said defecting units appeared a `` hodgepodge '' who might struggle to mount a sustained fight against superior forces . 
Protesters have occasionally seized weapons to attack security forces , but witnesses say protests have been generally peaceful . 
The appearance of loosely organized groups of military deserters lends a new dimension to the uprising . 
`` The strategy of peaceful opposition is clearly losing ground in the face of Assad 's brutal counter response and the call to arms is gaining currency as the only way of dislodging the regime , '' said Julien Barnes-Dacey , Middle East analyst at London-based consultancy Control Risks . 
`` The key question is whether or not this will spread and result in a more decisive break right across the military . '' 
Most believe that is unlikely . 
Syria 's military has long been divided along sectarian lines and most expect that the units most dedicated to Assad -- made up largely of Alawites who are an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam -- will remain loyal . 
That could leave neither side with the strength to win and open the door to months or years of war . 
The risk , experts say , is that neither side feels they can back down with the opposition fearing they will be hunted down and killed if Assad can reassert control whilst Alawites and other allied groups fear reprisals if he goes . 
Whilst some in Syria 's somewhat unsupported opposition may have ambitions of repeating the success of their counterparts in Libya in ultimately marching on the capital and taking power , few analysts believe that a plausible imminent outcome . 
`` The regime will most likely use this to in order to justify and further intensify its bloody crackdown , '' says Anthony Skinner , Middle East and North Africa director at political risk consultancy Maplecroft . 
`` This increases the risk of Syria sliding into a civil war . '' 
Some worry about a further regionalization of the conflict . 
In Bahrain , largely Sunni Gulf states backed the monarchy as it crushed unrest from primarily Shi'ite demonstrators demanding equal rights in jobs and public services . 
That raised hackles on both sides of the Middle East 's sectarian divide that could worsen further if largely Shi'ite Iran ramps up support for its long-time ally Assad and Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia move closer to backing the opposition . 
`` This has a lot of worrying regional implications , particularly if it leads to Syria moving toward becoming a failed state , '' said Stephen Heydemann , a senior vice president and regional specialist at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington . 
`` There 's a risk it could exacerbate regional tensions that have already been made worse by Bahrain . '' 
Sectarian fighting in Syria could also raise tensions between assorted other smaller cross-border groupings in neighboring countries including Alawites and Kurds in Turkey and Shi'ites and Sunnis in Lebanon . 
For now , analysts say it is still too soon to say whether enough soldiers will defect to form a force that could be a significant military threat to the Damascus government . 
`` The rate of defections is increasing , '' says Alan Fraser , Middle East analyst for London-based risk consultancy AKE . 
`` However ... it is coming amid a fall in the number of protests throughout the country -- which are slowly losing momentum amid the ongoing crackdown . 
It will take significantly greater numbers of defectors to significantly threaten the regime . '' 
Nor is it yet clear to what extent the wider , somewhat disparate opposition movement wants to embrace a more violent approach . 
The Syrian National Council , a unified opposition formed this month to support the uprising , and the Local Coordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- , the grassroots activist network that has powered the rolling demonstrations across Syria over the past six months , are explicitly against recourse to violence . 
`` It is not a countrywide trend , '' said Peter Harling of the International Crisis Group . 
`` In parts of the country people have been preparing themselves ... but continue showing restraint . 
In others , they simply can not afford weapons . '' 
In the longer run , some analysts say the opposition 's best hope is to try to hang on in the hope that ever tightening sanctions take their toll on Assad 's rule . 
Sanctions will likely starve his government of the oil sales that make up some 30 percent of government revenue , whilst much of the wider economy is also now effectively moribund or shut down . 
`` The Libya option is n't there , particularly because the Europeans and other regional powers are n't willing to play the role they played in Libya , '' said Jon Alterman , Middle East program director of the Center for Security and International Studies in Washington DC . 
`` There might be the option of some kind of covert operations support for the opposition but it 's hard to see what the point or strategy might be . '' 
Many outside groups working with Syria 's protesters have long tried to persuade them that taking up arms is the wrong way of pursuing their struggle , encouraging them instead to pursue non-violent methods such as boycotts and strikes . 
`` Any violence committed by opposition forces will harm the movement , '' said Srdja Popovic , a Serbian activist involved in the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic in 2001 and who now works with dissident groups worldwide including the Syrians . 
`` It will also diminish the possibility of achieving unity within the Syrian people and building a realistic alternative . '' 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
Just like in Egypt , Libya and Tunis , this uprising is to get rid of the brutal police state and implement a free democracy . 
This regime has a record of extreme brutality when dealing with anyone with an opinion , and people are sick of that and want change . 
Sectarianism has plays a very small role in this popular uprising .

2011-09-29,"TAWARGHA , Libya | Thu Sep 29 , 2011 12:15 pm BST TAWARGHA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Cast out of his home and with nowhere left to flee , Aboulharef al-Tawarghy laughs when he thinks of the Libyan fighters who toppled Muammar Gaddafi calling for freedom and justice . 
`` Their words are just ink on paper . 
I have n't seen any action , '' the 29-year-old electronics dealer said as he sat near a mosque in the embattled city of Sirte , where scores of men , women and children who fled their home town of Tawargha have found a precarious refuge . 
The families could not go home , they said , out of fear of reprisal attacks by anti-Gaddafi fighters from nearby Misrata who have accused them of harbouring the ousted leader 's troops and committing atrocities during a brutal , months-long siege . 
Tawargha , once home to thousands of people , is now almost entirely deserted , its windows smashed , its stores looted and its walls speckled with gunfire . 
Its inhabitants have scattered across Libya , many to cities such as Benghazi and Tripoli . 
The fate of the town , about 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- from Misrata , has posed a disquieting challenge for Libya 's new leaders in the interim National Transitional Council NTC . 
L as they try to reunify the war-scarred country and impose the rule of law . 
Adding to the issue 's sensitivity , Tawargha 's residents are overwhelmingly black , a legacy of the town 's history as a transit point in the 19th-century slave trade , locals say . 
Many young fighters have treated dark-skinned people with suspicion during the revolt because of reports Gaddafi hired mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa , but the feud between Tawargha and Misrata appears to be about more than just race . 
The NTC 's handling of the crisis will test its ability to rein in Libya 's many largely independent militias and prevent reprisals that could fuel bloodshed and recrimination . 
`` Those who committed crimes should be brought to justice , but it 's important not to generalise , '' NTC spokesman Jalal al-Gallal said , adding that the council favored the return of Tawargha 's residents , but that this would take time . 
`` At the moment it 's a very , very sensitive topic , '' Gallal said . 
`` The Misratans are still simmering . '' 
The derogatory graffiti covering Tawargha 's walls makes it clear where many local fighters stand on the question of return . 
`` Tawargha , you dogs , 3,000 km this way , '' reads one message spray-painted on a road sign , beside an arrow pointing south into the Sahara desert . 
`` Formerly Tawargha , '' says another . 
Many of Tawargha 's erstwhile residents say they see little hope of returning home , partly because their dark skin makes them obvious targets for vengeful fighters in the area . 
`` It 's about the color of the skin . 
That 's why they have problems with Tawargha , '' Samia Taher , a light-skinned Libyan woman born in Illinois who married into a Tawargha family , said as she rested near the mosque where families sheltered , a couple of km -LRB- miles -RRB- from the heart of Sirte , besieged by NTC forces . 
She was interrupted by a burst of tank fire from a nearby hill . 
Women in brightly-coloured headscarves gasped and children flinched as the boom echoed through the lot , where mattresses and blankets were piled up and men rested in the shade . 
`` I just want to get the family out of here . 
We 're in the middle of a battle here in Sirte , '' Taher , speaking in American-accented English , said of the struggle for Gaddafi 's birthplace . 
Many NTC fighters deny their feud with Tawargha is about race . 
But they are openly hostile toward the town , which they say supported Gaddafi in return for money and services . 
Even before the war , Misrata residents disparaged Tawargha , calling its young people criminals and drug addicts , or accusing its menfolk of marrying often and working little . 
Scorn turned to outright hostility after Gaddafi 's forces assaulted Misrata with rockets , snipers and artillery to try to quash the uprising there in February , using Tawargha as a staging ground for a siege that killed more than 1,000 people . 
With the help of NATO air strikes , anti-Gaddafi rebels were able to break the siege and take control of Tawargha . 
The charred husks of tanks , unexploded rockets and bullet casings on the outskirts of the town testify to the battle 's ferocity . 
Many in Misrata accuse men from Tawargha of looting homes and raping women in Misrata during the siege , claims that are impossible to confirm , but display the depth of their enmity . 
As evidence , one resident offered a cell phone video he said was found on a slain Gaddafi soldier . 
It showed scores of black men in green military jackets with assault rifles marching down a tree-lined road he said led from Tawargha to Misrata . 
Tawarghy and other residents admit that support for Gaddafi ran strong in their town , but are quick to add that this does not justify demonising and punishing an entire community . 
Some of those who have taken refuge in cities along the Mediterranean coast say their homes in Tawargha have been burned and that relatives or neighbors have been abducted or attacked . 
The group of about 135 sheltering near Sirte ricocheted for months from town to town in search of a haven , only to end up in the crossfire of one of the civil war 's last battles . 
`` It 's all very tragic . 
We lack security and safety , and we have to worry about food , '' Tawarghy -- the name he gave meaning one from Tawargha -- said . 
`` All this and you 're calling for freedom ? 
What kind of freedom are you seeking ? '' 
Gallal , the NTC spokesman , said he expected residents who had not committed crimes to return to their homes eventually . 
`` The other solution would be mass relocation of people . 
That 's hardly an ideal solution . 
Things are tense at the moment , but I think in time they will fall into place , '' he said . 
Any such restitution is sure to be complicated . 
Much of Tawargha is in ruins . 
The charred skeletons of cars , busted electronics and garbage cover the streets between bullet-scarred apartment blocks . 
Goats and camels wander amid the wreckage . 
Green flags , a symbol of support for Gaddafi , still flutter over many buildings , more than a month after the deposed leader 's forces were pushed out of the capital , Tripoli . 
Despite NTC assurances , many in Misrata say it would only lead to more violence if Tawargha 's residents were allowed to return , even if some were innocent . 
The crimes against Misrata were just too many and too heinous , they say . 
`` To avoid the recurrence of any future problems , we should separate the two groups , '' said a Misrata man named Saleh as he stood near a Tawargha apartment block being used as temporary shelter for non-Tawargha families fleeing fighting in Sirte . 
`` They should be compensated for their land and houses , and they should find a new area to live elsewhere . '' 
A man standing nearby echoed that view . 
`` Even if someone did n't do anything , his nephew or his cousin might have . 
Maybe 95 percent of people in Tawargha supported Gaddafi , '' he said . 
`` It 's better if they find somewhere else , far from Misrata . ''

2011-09-29,"\* To deliver to German Miro refinery - source \* Other U.S. majors also close to resuming buying \* Purchase to help further normalise Libya oil trade By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Emma Farge LONDON , Sept 29 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - ConocoPhillips became the first U.S. major to buy Libyan oil following the end of international sanctions in a move to help the country restore normal oil trade after seven months of civil war . 
Trading sources told Reuters that tanker Hellas Warrior , which loaded 381,000 barrels of Sarir and Mesla crude , was bought by Conoco for delivery to France 's Mediterranean port of Fos\/Lavera , and one source said it was destined for Germany 's MIRO refinery . 
Libya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- Agoco -RRB- gave the cargo to Vitol in payment for oil product deliveries , and Vitol then sold it to Conoco , the sources said . 
U.S. companies were among the most active buyers of light and low-sulphur Libyan crude before the civil war and were the first to stop purchases after Washington and the European Union slapped sanctions on the government of now-ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi . 
Sanctions against Libya have been removed or eased about a month ago , but sources at U.S. firms have said it will take a few weeks before they can resume purchases of Libyan crude . 
`` We have done most of the work and are close to sorting out our internal problems to be able to buy again , '' said a source at a major U.S. firm other than Conoco . 
A source at Libya 's National Oil Corporation -LRB- NOC -RRB- confirmed that the transaction had taken place and said it expected to start dealing with U.S. oil firms directly in the near future . 
`` That deal was done through Agoco . 
We have some contacts with the United States and they tell us they can start buying again , '' he said . 
Agoco , a subsidiary of NOC , has been handling marketing operations in recent months because of international sanctions on the umbrella firm . 
The NOC source said that it would start marketing crude again by mid-October . 
Oil is slowly starting to flow again from Libya after seven months of fighting and , if fresh projections prove correct , may beat the expectations of analysts , who think it could take three years to reach pre-war output levels . 
Libyan oil industry is dominated by European players , although U.S. companies such as Conoco , Marathon , Hess and Occidental are also involved in a number of exploration and production projects in the country , the holder of Africa 's largest oil reserves .

Full Article Analysis - Libya endgame carries new risks for NATO BRUSSELS | Sat Oct 1 , 2011 12:29 am IST BRUSSELS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - NATO commanders face a tough balancing act during the bloody battle for Muammar Gaddafi 's last strongholds , Sirte and Bani Walid . 
NATO allies would like to let the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- claim victory in these battles and war for itself . 
That would enhance the council 's legitimacy as the new ruler of Libya after Gaddafi 's four decades in power , and bolster the chances of a stable democracy taking root in the country . 
But the European governments that led NATO 's air campaign in Libya also need to remain long enough and engaged enough to make sure the success so far is not diminished by a messy withdrawal . 
If NATO quietly stepped aside but fighting restarted , that would diminish Europe 's standing in Libya and tarnish a campaign that has been seen as a success for Europeans . 
To achieve this , experts say , NATO forces are keen to cut back the bombing campaign that was instrumental in giving the NTC a military edge . 
Instead , NATO will likely step up other operations such as surveillance and air support to eliminate any remaining weaponry that could threaten peaceful transition . 
NATO declines to comment on its immediate operations . 
`` As we approach the endgame , it is very clear NATO 's role will become very much the eyes and ears of the NTC , rather than the hammer , '' said Tim Ripley , a London-based military expert at Jane 's Defense Weekly . 
`` The next phase in Libya will amount to a more deliberate mopping up of the country as the NTC moves to establish their control and presence . '' 
One problem is that Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists are in Bani Walid and Sirte , which are densely populated . 
That makes it risky to try to bomb them because of the danger of civilian casualties . 
NATO , argues Shashank Joshi , an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute in London , lacks sufficient intelligence to allow it to pinpoint targets in Sirte and Bani Walid without endangering civilians . 
`` We are in a fortress situation where the city is under siege . 
If you do n't know that a particular building is being used as a school or a mosque , even the best intelligence wo n't give you the details , '' he said . 
`` In Tripoli , you had rebels , you had -LRB- Western -RRB- special forces , networks of resistance . 
We do n't have that kind of information in Sirte or Bani Walid . 
So targeting is inherently difficult . '' 
To a degree , battle conditions with Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists necessitate a change of operational approach because of the limitations of NATO jets ' firepower which is to dangerous to use , said Ripley of Jane 's Defense Weekly . 
`` Gaddafi forces are no longer using tanks and artillery that were easier to hit and identify . 
The NTC is using infantry to drive Gaddafi 's forces from building to building , '' Ripley said . 
`` Both sides are operating in such close proximity that differentiating between the sides is difficult . 
That makes it very difficult to use air-drop weapons -LRB- bombs -RRB- . '' 
Experts say other constraints also complicate NATO 's operations in Sirte and Bani Walid as its military commanders plan how to fulfill the alliance 's United Nations mandate in Libya to protect civilians during the civil war . 
So far , NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said , there are no confirmed cases of civilians being killed by NATO power , although alliance officials say some can not be ruled out . 
Human rights organizations have called on the alliance to lean on NTC fighters to do more to protect civilians as worries mount for people trapped in Sirte . 
Desperation is growing in the besieged city as civilians try to flee the battle , both sides are accusing each other of endangering civilians , and aid agencies say a humanitarian disaster is looming because of shrinking supplies of water , electricity and food . 
`` NATO has significant influence over the actions of -LRB- NTC -RRB- forces , '' said Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch . 
`` And needs to use it to ensure that the NTC meet their legal obligation under international law -LRB- to avoid civilian casualties -RRB- , '' he said . 
Another challenge for NATO , Bouckaert added , was preventing NTC forces from taking action against civilians they suspect of siding with Gaddafi loyalists . 
`` It is essential that those civilian populations , even if they are pro-Gaddafi , do not suffer from vengeance , '' he said . 
NATO officials acknowledge difficulties they are facing in Gaddafi 's last strongholds but have given little indication of how much firepower the deposed leader has at his disposal , other than `` small logistical and mobility capabilities '' . 
`` Their actions are limited to tactical initiatives in isolated pockets , representing a fraction of Libya 's territory and population , '' said NATO spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie . 
`` They do n't control many access routes within Libya . 
The mission is not yet over but the end is near , '' Focusing on Gaddafi loyalists ' access routes to supplies or way out of their strongholds might be an important part of NATO tactics in the near future , military experts said . 
`` A very big role NATO can play is to dominate the terrain , the roads outside of town , '' said Ripley . 
`` They can enforce the siege but they can not finish off Gaddafi forces . 
They can prevent them from rebuilding , replenishing or escaping . '' 
Already , NATO figures from recent days show the alliance 's targeting has focused on storage and command facilities and less on tanks and artillery assets . 
Outside of Sirte and Bani Walid , NATO forces will likely concentrate on hunting down any weaponry left behind by the Gaddafi regime , experts said . 
`` There is a lot of kit left in the country , '' said Douglas Barrie , a military aviation specialist at London 's International Institute of Strategic Studies . 
`` The bombing campaign did n't destroy all of the regime 's military capacity by any stretch of imagination . 
We did n't have enough aircraft , we did n't have enough time . 
`` I suppose the -LRB- NATO -RRB- thinking is they do n't want to leave any credible rump of military capabilities that could cause problems for the transitional council . ''

2011-10-02,"SIRTE , Libya | Sun Oct 2 , 2011 6:21 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - People wounded in fighting in Libya 's besieged city of Sirte are dying on the operating table because fuel for the hospital generator has run out , medical workers fleeing the city said Sunday . 
The birthplace of deposed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is one of two towns still holding out against the country 's new rulers . 
The fighting has entered its third week and civilians are caught up in a worsening humanitarian crisis . 
The interim government , the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , declared a two-day truce to allow civilians to escape , but people emerging from the city said they knew nothing of the ceasefire , and that the shooting had not stopped . 
`` Doctors start operating , then the power goes . 
They have a few litres of fuel for the generators , then the lights go out when they operate , '' said a man who gave his name as Al-Sadiq , who said he ran the dialysis unit at Sirte 's main hospital . 
`` I saw a child of 14 die on the operating table because the power went out during the operation , '' he told Reuters on the western outskirts of the city . 
Aid workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- who brought medical supplies into Sirte Saturday could not reach the hospital because of shooting . 
That hospital has now become the focus of concerns about the humanitarian crisis in the city . 
`` It 's a catastrophe . 
Patients are dying every day for need of oxygen , '' said Mohammed Shnaq , a biochemist at the hospital who fled early Sunday during a lull in the shooting . 
He said private pharmacies in Sirte had handed over their supplies to the hospital after its own stocks ran out a week ago , but these were now running out too . 
The ICRC said that it planned to go back into Sirte and hoped to reach the hospital , security permitting . 
`` We want to deliver oxygen , which is lacking at the hospital , '' ICRC spokesman Marcal Izard told Reuters in Geneva . 
`` But it has to be done carefully , oxygen is very delicate . 
A stray bullet would be a disaster . '' 
Colonel Hamed Al-Hasi , commander of the anti-Gaddafi Qatar brigade east of Sirte , said the truce had expired Sunday , but a full assault was still out of the question . 
`` There are still more than 15,000 persons inside . 
We can not sacrifice them , '' he said . 
He said NTC forces would for now instead be targeting the district of Bouhadi , just to the south of Sirte . 
He said a captured Gaddafi loyalist had told them that Mo'atassem , one of the deposed Libyan leader 's sons and his former national security adviser , was in the district . 
`` We 've been concentrating since last night on Bouhadi , '' he said . 
`` If we catch Mo'atassem , things will calm down . '' 
NATO warplanes were more in evidence than in previous days , with aircraft flying unusually low over the city . 
In one 10-minute period there was a steady rumble from bombs dropping on an area south of the city , a Reuters reporter said . 
Libyans ended Gaddafi 's 42-year rule in August when rebel fighters stormed the capital . 
Gaddafi and several of his sons are still at large , and his supporters hold Sirte and the town of Bani Walid , south of Tripoli . 
Gaddafi 's supporters are too weak to regain power , but their resistance is frustrating the new rulers ' efforts to start building the post-Gaddafi Libya . 
While it needs to stamp out the last resistance swiftly , the NTC does not want to use indiscriminate shelling , which could hurt its standing and make it even harder to govern Libya 's fractious tribes and regions . 
Gaddafi loyalists and some civilians have blamed NATO air strikes and shelling by anti-Gaddafi forces for the deaths of civilians in Sirte . 
Both NATO and the NTC deny that and say it is the Gaddafi loyalists who are endangering civilians by using them as human shields . 
Khalid Ahmed , who fled the city early Sunday , said the residential area where he lives in the center of Sirte had come under heavy artillery fire Saturday . 
`` The reason there is shooting in the city center is that the pro-Gaddafi militia has positioned artillery in the buildings where civilians live . 
The children are terrified and they are screaming all the time . '' 
He said he had been able to get out by borrowing money to buy black-market fuel . 
He said the rate in Sirte now was 600 dinars , or about $ 450 , for 20 litres of fuel . 
Doctors at a field hospital east of Sirte said four NTC fighters had been killed Sunday in `` friendly fire '' incidents -- testament to the often-chaotic conduct of the anti-Gaddafi forces . 
The focus on the battle for the last pro-Gaddafi strongholds -- and on tracking down Gaddafi himself -- has left a power vacuum in Tripoli . 
With no process in motion for electing a new leadership , power on the ground is wielded by anti-Gaddafi militias who are jockeying with each other for influence in the new Libya . 
Some analysts warn that this rivalry could turn violent . 
One commander in Tripoli said he was setting up an armed group to keep order in the city , even though that function is already carried out by a body led by Abdulhakim Belhadj , a former militant Islamist . 
`` Who is he ? 
Who appointed him ? '' 
said Abdullah Ahmed Naker , the head of the new group , when asked about Belhadj . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
The quotes in the title might make someone take this the wrong way . 
Nato does n't seem to mind killing civilians who belong to tribes who wo n't succumb to it . 
The fall of Sirte was first reported 28\/08\/2011 by Haaretz . 
After that date a stream of reports stating that surrender of the Libyan Armes Forces -LRB- LAF -RRB- was imminent and giving totally contradictory distances of the `` advancing '' rebel forces which according to BBC 29\/08\/2011 were 18 miles from the city center -- this figure actually increased as the days went by . 
Over a month later the same reports of an imminenet rebel victory in Sirte from the media . 
Further , the repeated myth of only two cities still under Libyan Govt . 
control just does n't fit the facts . 
80 % of the country remains under LAF control and the town of Ghadames has just been retaken by them . 
A counter offensive has been anounced by the LAF . 
Khamis Gaddafi has been reported dead at on at least 5 different occasions only to miraculously reappear sever days later idem Ibrahim Moussa . 
From the beginning of the civil war and intervention of Nato the rebels have been killing each other starting with the summary execution of the rebel General Younes . 
It is clear that : 1 -RRB- The majority of Libyans are against the CNT rebels and oppose the British , French and Qattari presence . 
2 -RRB- Without Nato air support the civil war would have been over months ago and the rebels in prison . 
3 -RRB- The CNT , even with the miliary support of NATO , is a disparate puppet group representing corporate and western interests and will be incapable of governing the country -- their leaders are already resigning or grasping for power . 
4 -RRB- The inaccurate and selective reporting by the media of this civil war has directly contributed to British and French citizens accepting that their respective governments order the bombing of tens of thousands of ordinary Libyan citizens . 
When will the truth and ordinary Libyans become important to news publications ?

2011-10-02,"Libya 's Waha Oil faces tough task to fix war damage TRIPOLI | Sun Oct 2 , 2011 12:20 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Forces loyal to deposed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi have destroyed vehicles and equipment at some fields owned by Libya 's Waha Oil company and at others security is still too shaky to visit , an engineer with the company said on Sunday . 
Waha Oil is owned by Libya 's National Oil Corporation in a joint venture with American firms ConocoPhillips , Marathon and Amerada Hess . 
Before the conflict , it pumped nearly half a million barrels of oil per day -LRB- 380,000 bpd -RRB- but it is now producing no crude . 
`` They -LRB- company managers -RRB- sent a group of engineers and they have gone around to see the damage , although they were not able to make it to all locations as some are still dangerous because Gaddafi 's troops are still there , '' said Abdullatif Hetwash , an engineer who has worked for Waha Oil for 36 years . 
Waha operates four main oil fields , including Waha , Dahra , Samah and has its main base at the Es-sider terminal on Libya 's Mediterranean coast . 
`` Waha is not safe yet , Samah is not safe yet , but they managed to visit Gialo and reported that everything , the warehouse , facilities , accommodation , has all been destroyed by Gaddafi 's troops . 
They went in and they destroyed the equipment and have taken most of the spare parts , '' he said . 
`` In one raid they took 127 trucks from Es-sider terminal and one of our transport managers gave up to Gaddafi 's troops 60 new Land Rovers . 
We have the report . 
He was pro-Gaddafi . '' 
Most of Libya is nominally under the control of the new interim government , but security provision is patchy and fighting is still going on at Sirte , on the Mediterranean coast , and at Bani Walid , south-east of Tripoli . 
Just weeks ago , 17 people were killed in a raid by militia at Ras Lanuf , Libya 's largest refinery . 
`` There 's no security , no electricity , no food and looting at the warehouses , '' said Hetwash . 
`` In some areas 90 percent of spare parts and motors have been destroyed , and we can not start production until they are replaced because it is dangerous , '' he added . 
It could take six months to restore the facilities at the fields seen by the Waha Oil team , Hetwash said , and the restart is being held up by key workers who say they will not return to the fields until managers , seen as remnants of Gaddafi 's regime , agree to step down . 
He said if the internal dispute is resolved , engineers and other workers are ready to start the work of getting Waha Oil 's fields back on stream . 
`` Most of the people that produce the oil are here . 
We can do without them , the managers . 
We can start from tomorrow if we can have enough transport , equipment , tools and materials , '' Hetwash said . 
Along with hundreds of Waha Oil employees , Hetwash was at a rally on Sunday outside the company 's headquarters to demand a change of management . 
The protest reflected the freedom that Libyans are now enjoying after Gaddafi 's autocratic rule came to an end , and the grievances that built up for decades . 
Before , security forces would stop any public show of dissent . 
`` The chairman and members must go immediately , and not wait another minute , '' said Widad El Said , a secretary at the company for four years . 
`` Everything has stopped for eight months and this is not good for Libya . 
But all the employees in the fields have refused to go back because they will never trust the management again '' she said . 
In August , Marathon Oil said it has had preliminary discussions with the interim government , the National Transitional Council , on restarting output at the Waha field . 
But the firm said it would n't send staff back to Libya until it could ensure their safety .

2011-10-05,"TRIPOLI Oct 5 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's National Oil Company -LRB- NOC -RRB- denied that any new deal involving Libyan oil has been struck with Britain 's Heritage Oil , highlighting the risks of doing business at a time when fighting continues in parts of the country . 
Heritage said on Tuesday it bought 51 percent of Benghazi-based Sahara Oil Services Holdings for $ 19.5 million . 
But NOC 's director of international cooperation , Ahmed Al-Taghdi , told Reuters on Wednesday it was too early to consider any new deals involving Libyan oil companies . 
`` I have been instructed to deny these reports , '' Al-Taghdi said in an interview . 
The British company insisted a deal had been agreed upon and said approval from the Libyan state oil company was not required . 
`` Heritage is reiterating what it said yesterday , which is that it has not signed a deal with the NOC , it has merely acquired a stake in a support services firm , '' a spokesman for Heritage said . 
`` It is not something the NOC has to go through a subsequent approval process on . '' 
Al-Taghdi said Tuesday 's reports were incorrect and that no new deal involving services or production had been authorised . 
The following statement later appeared on NOC 's website : `` The National Oil Corporation denies the existence of any talks with British firm Heritage to reach an agreement on re-upgrading some oilfields , starting production and awarding privileges . '' 
Libya 's oil sector is in flux as the country begins to emerge from more than six months of civil war . 
Fighting continues to sever Tripoli from the east of the country , and the oil sector faces an imminent reshuffle under the new government . 
NOC subsidiaries have called for independence from the state oil body , with Total 's Libyan venture calling for the all-powerful NOC to be dismantled and assume the role of regulator and Benghazi-based Agoco tendering cargoes for delivery later this month . 
Britain has moved fast to win the favor of Libya 's new government in the hope it will help its firms gain access to the North African country 's oil reserves . 
Cash-rich Heritage has a long history in Africa and a reputation for being a first-mover into political hotspots . 
The relatively small outlay for the British company dwarfs the potential returns from securing new deals . 
Others eyeing a quick return to Libya 's oil business may be deterred by the development , in a country where the political landscape is still highly fluid and the organization of the oil sector itself is uncertain . 
The NOC said at the start of the week it would resume full control over the oil business in Libya within the month , but there have been calls from its oil producing subsidiaries for more autonomy . 
There are signs Agoco is enjoying its independence after playing a crucial role in supporting the NTC during the height of the conflict . 
Heritage said on Tuesday it had discussed its deal with members of the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- which has yet to appoint a separate oil minister and plans to fully hand back responsibility for the oil sector to the all-powerful NOC .

2011-10-09,"An anti-Gaddafi soldier breaks a picture frame holding a photo of Muammar Gaddafi inside Ibn Sina hospital in the center of Sirte October 9 , 2011 . 
SIRTE , Libya | Sun Oct 9 , 2011 12:41 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan transitional government forces said on Sunday they had captured landmark buildings in a thrust towards the center of Muammar Gaddafi 's hometown Sirte , but were holding off an assault on its main square to allow civilians to escape the chaotic fighting . 
Taking Sirte would bring Libya 's new rulers a big step closer to establishing control of the entire , sprawling North African country almost two months after they seized the capital Tripoli , but pro-Gaddafi snipers have slowed their advance . 
`` We have made good progress , '' said Mahmoud Bayu , commander of the Shohada Al-Manatair brigade , to the south of Sirte . 
`` We have entered the Ouagadougou -LRB- conference -RRB- center , there is some fighting going on , but it 's under our control . '' 
National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- forces also wrested control of the main hospital , a Reuters witness said , capturing more than a dozen pro-Gaddafi fighters who had used the complex to fire mortars and rocket-propelled grenades . 
`` We are trying to evacuate the sick and wounded , '' said Salah Mustafa , a commander of the government forces . 
`` Most of the Gaddafi militia fled , some of them have disguised themselves as doctors . 
We have to investigate . '' 
Some 15 Gaddafi loyalists were marched out of the hospital premises and one was punched in the back of the head when NTC forces found a picture of the deposed leader in his pocket . 
Bayu said NTC forces had reached the main square of the Mediterranean coastal city of 75,000 people , but could not move in yet as they were waiting for civilians to leave the area . 
A further important target for the new advance on Sirte , the university , had been seized overnight , NTC forces in the east of the city said , but they came under heavy fire there on Sunday morning and some fighters had fallen back . 
`` Last night , we were sleeping in the university and this morning we came under random strikes there , '' said a fighter who had withdrawn from the position . 
`` We have martyrs -LRB- dead -RRB- inside and we are trying to get them out . '' 
Two bodies lay in a nearby field hospital , one with his face blown off . 
They had been hit by fire from an anti-aircraft gun while trying to evacuate patients from a frontline hospital , their comrades said . 
Lines of pick-up trucks mounted with heavy weaponry waited to move up to take on a sniper who was slowing their advance . 
The prolonged struggle to vanquish Sirte and the other few remaining bastions of pro-Gaddafi loyalists has sidetracked NTC efforts to set up effective government over the sprawling North African country and rebuild oil production vital to its economy . 
Sirte holds symbolic significance because Gaddafi , who ruled for 42 years , turned it from a fishing village into a second capital . 
He built opulent villas , hotels and conference halls to house the international summits he liked to stage there . 
But taking Sirte carries risks for Libya 's new rulers . 
A drawn-out battle with many civilian casualties will breed hostility that will make it very difficult for the NTC to unite the country once the fighting is over . 
Thousands of civilians have fled Sirte as fighting has intensified , describing increasingly desperate conditions for those still inside the seafront city . 
There is no electricity while drinking water and food are running out , and there is the stench of rotting corpses at the city 's hospital . 
But Britain 's defense secretary told Reuters that NATO , which has carried out air strikes effectively on behalf of anti-Gaddafi forces over much of Libya 's civil war , had stayed within its U.N. mandate to protect civilians during the siege of Sirte . 
`` NATO has been extraordinarily careful in target selection . 
NATO has been very careful to minimize civilian casualties , '' Liam Fox told Reuters in an interview in the Libyan town of Misrata -- smashed up by pro-Gaddafi shelling during the war . 
`` NATO has stayed within its mandate throughout . ''

2011-10-10,"SIRTE , Libya | Mon Oct 10 , 2011 5:55 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan transitional government forces said they had cornered Muammar Gaddafi loyalists in the center of the deposed leader 's hometown on Monday , where desperate civilians were still trying to flee the fierce street fighting . 
The protracted battle for Sirte has raised concerns that civilian casualties could breed long-term hostility and make it hard for the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- to unite the vast North African state once the fighting is over . 
`` Gaddafi 's forces are cornered in two neighborhoods near the sea , an area of about 2-km square , but there is still resistance , '' Abdul Salam Javallah , commander of NTC units from eastern Libya , told Reuters on the front line of their attack . 
`` We are dealing with them now with light weapons because there are still families inside , '' he said . 
Shortly after he spoke , a group of three women , three small children and two male civilians emerged from a house on the front line . 
They were searched by the rebels and hurriedly got into a car and drove off waving the V-for-victory sign . 
Another family of three women and one man , stopping at a checkpoint as they fled Sirte , said they had been trapped in their house by the fighting . 
`` We did n't know where the strikes were coming from . 
Everyone is being hit all day and all night . 
There is no electricity and no water . 
There is not one neighborhood that has n't been hit , '' said one of the women who gave her name as Umm Ismail . 
NTC commanders say they are using only light weapons , but government tanks have also moved into road intersections and pounded Gaddafi positions , while pick-up trucks mounted with heavy weapons as well as foot soldiers darted out of cover to fire wildly up ahead . 
At times , NTC units came under fire from their own side , a hazard becoming more acute as the poorly coordinated groups of government volunteers attacking from the east and west close in on one another . 
Most of the NTC forces attacking Sirte are from other towns and do not have much help from the inside as they did they when they captured the capital Tripoli on August 23 and ended 42 years of one-man rule by Gaddafi after six months of civil war . 
GADDAFI 'S MEN FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES Many civilians from Sirte are also fighting alongside the remnants of Gaddafi 's army in the belief the outsiders will commit atrocities once they capture the city of 75,000 people , which Gaddafi built into a lavish second capital . 
`` Gaddafi 's troops know their way around , '' said one government fighter in a brief lull in the fighting . 
`` We do n't know the city . 
We do n't even know what 's in the next street . '' 
Gaddafi is believed to be hiding in the desert to the south . 
NTC forces have struggled to take Sirte and a few other bastions of Gaddafi loyalists , which has impeded efforts to set up effective government nationwide and restart oil production , the lifeblood of the Libyan economy . 
Several Libyan analysts also say they are worried fault lines are opening up between the Islamist-run Tripoli Military Council , which has nominal control over the capital and is also believed to be backed by Qatar , and groups loyal to interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril , a Western-trained technocrat . 
The interim government sent out text messages on Monday urging their fighters to report to military bases and join the national army . 
Concern is rising in the capital about potential conflict among armed groups that converged on Tripoli in August and have stayed on to demand stakes in a future government . 
NTC forces in Sirte took three important landmark buildings on Sunday -- the main hospital , the university and the opulent Ouagadougou conference center , built to host the summits of foreign dignitaries that Gaddafi was fond of staging . 
`` Eighty percent of Sirte is now under our control , '' said Omar Abu Lifa , a commander of government forces attacking Sirte from the west . 
NTC forces have repeatedly claimed to be on the point of victory in Sirte , only to suffer sudden reversals at the hands of tenacious enemies fighting for their lives , surrounded on three sides and with their backs to the sea . 
In just one field hospital to the east of the city , doctors said they had received 20 dead and 87 wounded over the last two days from fighting . 
There were many more casualties elsewhere . 
One man , a student , who had escaped from the center of the city , said he had watched from a rooftop on Sunday as Gaddafi soldiers destroyed 10 government pick-up trucks . 
`` Their morale is very high , '' said Salam Awad . 
`` They are prepared to fight to the death . '' 
NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil said his men had reached Sirte city center , while the only other major town in the hands of Gaddafi loyalists , Bani Walid in the interior desert to the south , was also under siege from no fewer than five sides . 
`` I think and I hope , with the help of God , the liberation of these two towns will be completed by the end of this week . 
God willing , '' he told a news conference in Tripoli on Sunday . 
Sirte holds symbolic significance because Gaddafi turned it from a fishing village into a second capital . 
He built opulent villas , hotels and conference halls to house the international summits he liked to stage there . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
It would serve you well if that was made more clear in your headlines . 
You tend to do the same thing with the Syrian conflict . 
Reuters should be above being the mouthpiece for the U.S. State Dept. . 
The reports by the Mass Media , as someone rightly said , is largely based on reports from the NTC . 
We hear reports like , the last bastions of Gadhafi Loyalists . 
So many reports that made it to press have turned out to be false . 
One would think , after being fed with outright lies , many times , in the past , the Media will employ due diligence before running to their blogs to post lies . 
I guess the Media , NATO and the NTC are fingers of the same hand . 
They complement one another . 
For those that do n't know , Jamahiriyas , the tribal Councils , and not the NTC , control 80 % of Libyan cities . 
They were fast to hoist the banner of ` mission accomplished ' on taking Tripoli . 
The Media , in their culpability , reported to readers as if the war in Libya had been won by the Rebels . 
To-day , NATO is still bombing ferociously . 
I guess their mission is far from been accomplished . 
To anonymot : Reuters is a fantastic news outlet . 
They are not a `` mouthpiece '' for anyone . 
And to comment on Reuters when the FORMER regime has n't sputtered a word of truth in 42 years ! 
You appear to be a troll but we can spot you a mile away . 
And it is n't necessarily anti-Gadaffi reporting , it 's anti-brutal mass murdering dictator .

2011-10-12,"TRIPOLI | Wed Oct 12 , 2011 10:00 am EDT TRIPOLI Oct 12 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A holiday in Libya may sound like an absurdity now , but many of the country 's tour operators and officials are already starting to predict a bright future for the travel industry once the dust of war settles . 
The coastal country has all the makings for a vibrant tourism business , they say : warm weather , beaches , antiquities and proximity to Europe -- all factors that helped the industry thrive in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia . 
If developed , tourism could eventually help dent Libya 's high jobless rate by creating work for tour guides , drivers , restaurant workers and hotel staff , as well as help it diversify its economy away from dependency on oil and gas . 
The fact that operators are thinking about resuming business at all -- some predicted tourists would start arriving again within a year -- testifies to the relative peace that has prevailed in Tripoli and other parts of Libya since the former rebels ousted Muammar Gaddafi 's forces from the capital in August . 
One company , Sherwes Travel , already advertises a three-day , 295-euro tour of `` post-war Libya '' on its website , featuring visits to sites in Tripoli and to the Roman ruins of Leptis Magna . 
Employees admit it may be a bit optimistic . 
`` The tour was very popular , actually . 
But not now , not yet , '' said Ibrahim Usta , the company 's self-described international customer assistant . 
He said while some potential visitors had been in touch , it was not yet possible to bring them to Libya . 
`` We have many inquiries right now , but the problem is mainly security and visas , '' he said . 
`` There 's no -LRB- visa -RRB- system in place and many embassies are not functioning . '' 
Usta and others said tourism was languishing before the revolt because of apathy , incompetence , complex visa requirements , draconian police oversight and mercurial regulations under Gaddafi 's government . 
Sabri Ellotai , manager of Sabri Tours and Travel , described bringing a group of Germans in 2009 only to have them turned away at the airport because they did not have an Arabic translation for their passports -- a requirement he had never heard of before . 
`` I heard about it -LRB- the law -RRB- at the airport , '' Ellotai said , shaking his head . 
He and others said they hoped the country 's new rulers -- currently represented by the interim National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- -- would be able to do more with the industry when the war is over . 
NTC forces are still fighting to take over Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte and a few other bastions of Gaddafi loyalists , which has impeded efforts to set up effective government nationwide and restart oil production . 
Libya 's lucrative oil and gas industry made tourism less of a priority than in Egypt and Tunisia , where it was a major contributor of jobs and foreign revenues before the uprisings in those countries . 
Libyan central bank official Ali Shnebesh estimated tourism could account for between 3 and 4 percent of the economy within five to ten years , depending on how much effort the country 's new government puts into it . 
`` It would decrease unemployment , since we have a lot of areas that are good for tourism , '' he said . 
`` It would put thousands of our people to work in these places in many sectors -- telecommunications , transportation , hotels -- everywhere . '' 
It is difficult to tell how much tourism contributed to Libya 's economy before the revolt because it was not tracked as a separate industry in central bank records , but Shnebesh estimated it was below half a percent of gross domestic product . 
That compares to Egypt , for instance , where officials said it accounted for over 11 percent before the revolt . 
There is plenty of evidence of the lax oversight at the ancient Greek colony of Cyrene , which was featured in the chronicler Herodotus 's `` The Histories '' and is now a UNESCO world heritage site , in the eastern Jebel al-Akhdar region . 
The site is overgrown with weeds and graffiti etched onto one of its old columns . 
A renovation crew of Italians , Americans and French fled after the uprising started , guards there said . 
Jamal Salem , 50 , sitting in the afternoon sun outside a souvenir shop filled with woven baskets , photographs and ceramic statues still on display , said there were n't many visitors even before the revolt . 
`` A lot of people think Libyans are terrorists , and so they 're afraid of coming here , '' he said . 
`` We hope the picture will become clearer now , and that things will get better . '' 
Others lingering in the area of Cyrene said they also hoped the revolt would help stamp out what they saw as widespread corruption and regional favouritism in the industry . 
`` Before , companies had their headquarters in Tripoli . 
They brought the cars from Tripoli , they brought the translators from Tripoli , everything . 
Nobody here benefited from it at all , '' Hussein Saleh , who volunteered to help guard Cyrene , said . 
Others near Cyrene and other sites said they also hoped a new government would show more interest in preserving relics . 
`` We 're expecting a better future , and maybe more interest in renovating the antiquities , '' said Muftah Mabrook , a 35-year-old researcher at the ancient Greek port of Apollonia , a picturesque collection of columns and other ruins set against the sea . 
While such ambitions are running high , it 's too soon to say how the situation will turn out . 
Tripoli 's atmospheric old city is slowly coming back to life as jewelry shops and cafes reopen up in its winding streets , for instance , but many alleys are still littered with bullet casings . 
In some areas , young men with Kalashnikov assault rifles sit smoking and chatting on stoops or around street corners . 
They are friendly , for the most part , as they smile and wave at foreign passersby , but their presence is not likely to encourage most holidaymakers . 
The relative lack of English and French language speakers , as well as the ban on alcohol , may also make it hard for Libya to compete on a large scale with Egypt and Tunisia even after the war is finished , some operators say . 
But Usta , like many others , was confident the industry would eventually thrive . 
`` We have everything . 
We have the desert , we have the sea , we have mountains . 
We just need the right people in the right place . ''

2011-10-13,"SIRTE , Libya | Thu Oct 13 , 2011 1:27 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fighters loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fought a last-ditch battle in an ever shrinking pocket of resistance in the ousted leader 's hometown Sirte on Thursday . 
National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- commanders moved up tanks to fire at buildings from close range to try to dislodge the remaining Gaddafi snipers who are now surrounded on all sides in one small part of the city . 
`` We have control of the whole of the city except neighborhood ` Number Two ' where the Gaddafi forces are surrounded , '' said Khaled Alteir , a field commander in Sirte . 
`` This operation is on its dying breath , '' said another commander , Colonel Mohammad Aghfeer . 
The siege of Sirte , which began after the capital Tripoli fell to the NTC two months ago , has held up Libya 's transition to normality as the country 's new leaders say they will only start building a democratic system after the city is captured . 
Efforts to extinguish resistance in Sirte received a big boost on Wednesday when , NTC officials said , government forces captured Gaddafi 's son Mo ` tassim , a former national security adviser , as he tried to escape the battle-torn city . 
`` He was arrested today in Sirte , '' the head of the Tripoli Revolutionary Council , Colonel Abdullah Naker , told Reuters . 
Other NTC officials in Benghazi confirmed Mo ` tassim had been captured and said he was taken to a military base in the eastern city , but the council has yet to make an official confirmation , or denial of the reports . 
Mo ` tassim would be the first member of the Gaddafi family to fall into the hands of the new government that emerged after six months of civil war . 
Gaddafi himself is believed to be hiding somewhere in Libya 's vast desert in the south of the country . 
Die-hard loyalists to the deposed leader have not given up the fight , answering NTC attacks in Sirte with small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades . 
An NTC commander said Gaddafi 's besieged forces were no longer using heavier weapons . 
Green flags , the banner of Gaddafi 's 42-year rule , still fly above many of the buildings in Sirte , but the commander said , the defending forces appeared to have lost their cohesion . 
`` We 've noticed now they are fighting every man for himself , '' said Baloun Al Sharie , a field commander . 
`` We tried to tell them it 's enough and to give themselves up , but they would not . '' 
NTC officers say Gaddafi loyalists fear reprisals if they give themselves up . 
Some captured fighters have been roughed up by NTC forces and Amnesty International issued a report on Wednesday saying Libya 's new rulers were in danger of repeating human rights abuses commonplace during Muammar Gaddafi 's rule . 
The NTC said it would look into the report . 
Close to the center of the fighting in Sirte , government forces found 25 corpses wrapped in plastic sheets . 
They accused Gaddafi militias of carrying out execution-style killings . 
Five corpses shown to a Reuters team wore civilian clothes , had their hands tied behind their backs and gunshot wounds to the head . 
As the tanks pounded the apartment blocks where Gaddafi 's men are holed up , pick-up trucks mounted with heavy machine guns moved in behind , then infantry armed with AK-47s began their assault . 
One field hospital received two NTC dead and 23 wounded on Thursday . 
One of the dead men had been hit while taking food up to the fighters on the front line , doctors said . 
In the skies , NATO aircraft have been carrying out reconnaissance missions and Britain said its jets had bombed and destroyed two pick-up trucks belonging to Gaddafi 's forces in Sirte on Wednesday . 
But as the battle for Libya draws toward what the NTC and NATO hope will be a close , both the new government and the Western alliance which helped topple Gaddafi are looking toward a return to normality . 
The provisional Libyan government and NATO signed an agreement on Thursday to immediately open air corridors for international civilian flights from Benghazi , and domestic flights between the second city and Tripoli and Misrata . 
This is one of the first step toward NATO lifting its no-fly zone over Libya imposed after Gaddafi began a military assault on civilians protesting his one-man rule . 
German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said 150 wounded Libyans would be treated in Germany . 
Berlin plans to support Libya with medical supplies and aid and help in training and educating young Libyans , he said `` We are here because we see the most important raw material of Libya , it is not oil and gas ... -LRB- it is -RRB- the younger people who started the revolution here . 
They need future and perspective after their victory , '' Roesler told a news conference in Tripoli . 
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . 
other media outlets are saying a different story , maybe maybe not . 
it has not been confirmed as 100 % fact . 
so why does your headlines read as such ? 
because you and the rest of the MSM believe whatever the NTC and NATO tells you . 
and the other side that is now the new rebels dont get any voice .

2011-10-15,"TRIPOLI | Sat Oct 15 , 2011 9:10 am EDT TRIPOLI Oct 15 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Thousands of Libyans fleeing fighting in the besieged cities of Sirte and Bani Walid are straining the resources of struggling nearby towns , but the emergency relief fund set up by foreign donors says it is no longer its job to help . 
The fund was set up in a Qatari account to circumvent sanctions in order to help the erstwhile rebels during the war against Muammar Gaddafi . 
It has swollen to more than half a billion U.S. dollars , but only a fraction of the money donated , unfrozen or on loan has been spent . 
The fund says it is no longer responsible for providing emergency cash and its current mandate is to invest in long-term projects , its manager Mazin Ramadan told Reuters . 
International aid organizations should tackle the humanitarian crisis , he said . 
`` We want to fund civil society in Libya , we need to do a better job of communicating that , '' Ramadan said . 
He said confusion had arisen because of the fund 's early involvement in emergency activities , but it was now focusing on designing a program to fund future non-governmental organizations based in Libya . 
When Qatar set up the fund in April , the aim was to provide Libya with a lifeline down which other countries could channel funds without violating sanctions . 
Qatar was the first Arab state to recognize the then opposition and donated the first $ 100 million . 
Many Libyans are still desperate for money and it is no longer clear where they can hope to obtain cash , or who will help the swelling numbers of internally displaced people . 
`` Unfrozen money has been put in the Temporary Financing Mechanism , but it takes a long time for them to use it , '' secretary of finance Emraja Gaith told Reuters in an interview . 
Cash freed up by foreign governments should be transferred directly to the central bank , he said , because it could process urgent payments more effectively . 
-LRB- ID : nL5E7LA3NX -RRB- But local authorities say they have only received a fraction of the money they need to cope with the flood of families escaping the fighting in the last two places where Gaddafi loyalists are still holding out ; Sirte and Bani Walid . 
Some have even journeyed to the capital , cap in hand , to ask new government head Mustafa Abdel Jalil directly for funds . 
As Jalil met the Canadian ambassador , Hakim Badran from Mizdah council waited to see him and ask for money he said was urgently needed to cope with the thousands taking shelter in schools and homes in his village , just west of Bani Walid . 
`` Jalil told me if I came here I could speak to him , '' Badran said . 
In Tripoli , officials said the capital 's resources were also being tested by the arrival of thousands of internally displaced people and more money was needed to provide services in the capital . 
`` In Tripoli we have only received a small amount of the money we asked for . 
We have 15 million dinar -LRB- $ 12.2 million -RRB- ... this is not enough , '' said Ahmed Al Tarhouni , an aide to the council 's head , Abderrazzaq Buhagiar . 
Officially the Temporary Financing Mechanism now tops $ 500 million , after $ 400 million was released from frozen Libyan assets in the United States , further donations were made from Bahrain and Kuwait and Germany made a loan in August . 
About $ 130 million has been spent so far ; on fuel , hospital bills and salaries delivered to a remote mountain region that had been struggling without cash for months . 
Fund officials say further projects will go to non-governmental organizations able to meet the needs of Libyans who have lost their homes , incomes or family in the war , and decentralise some spending power to local government . 
But many of the councillors interviewed were unaware of the fund , or did not know whether they qualified for money . 
Most of Libya 's estimated $ 170 billion in frozen assets are still out of reach , and despite pledges by global powers to make money available , just one third of a promised $ 15 billion has been unfrozen . 
The National Transitional Council has spent $ 1.6 billion so far , the bulk of which has been handed to local councils to provide salaries in many areas which had not seen a pay packet since the uprising began in February .

2011-10-17,"LONDON | Mon Oct 17 , 2011 9:08 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Pro-Gaddafi fighters may resort to hit-and-run guerilla attacks against Libyan politicians , foreign workers and oil installations in the remote southwestern Fezzan district if they are driven from their last bastions , risk consultants say . 
A full-scale insurgency like the one that erupted in Iraq following the ouster of Saddam Hussein by U.S.-led forces is unlikely , but a determined guerrilla campaign could make life difficult for Libya 's new rulers and foreign oil companies considering a return . 
`` Gaddafi supporters will not be able to conduct an insurgency because they do not have the popular support , but they have the technical ability to launch a bombing and assassination campaign against foreigners and NTC leaders , '' said Firas Abi Ali , deputy head of Middle East and North Africa forecasting for Exclusive Analysis . 
Forces loyal to Libya 's ruling National Transitional Council are now moving more tanks into the center of Sirte to try to crush the last pocket of resistance by loyalists of ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi in his home town . 
Other loyalists are still holding out in Bani Walid . 
But guerrilla tactics , used throughout Libyan history against colonial rulers , could stall efforts to rebuild the country after eight months of fighting and ward off foreign oil workers , who are seen as key to restoring output to pre-war levels of 1.6 million barrels per day . 
Such a strategy would also complicate decisions for foreign airlines and oil companies torn between returning to business and protecting their staff in the heavily-armed and heavily-mined country . 
Many are for now settling for quick meet-and-greet encounters with Libya 's new leaders in Tripoli until they get further assurances on safety . 
Control Risks last week dropped its assessment of the travel risk to Tripoli to `` high '' but the classification remains `` extreme '' in many other parts of the country . 
But that was before a gunbattle erupted in the Libyan capital on Friday between NTC forces and up to 50 armed supporters of the deposed Gaddafi . 
Even for those who think the gains justify the risks , insurance premiums are high for doing business in a country where NATO has vowed to extend an air-and-sea campaign until at least December . 
Analysts said that the highest-risk area for attacks was in the oil-rich southwestern Saharan desert region , Fezzan , which was held by pro-Gaddafi fighters until late September . 
Fezzan , where many Libyans believe their former leader is in hiding , is home to Eni 's Elephant and Repsol 's Sharara fields . 
Their combined capacity of around 330,000 bpd is about a fifth of Libya 's total pre-war output . 
While the impact on the oil industry in this region would be less than in the Sirte Basin , now deemed to be relatively secure , attacks could still slow or even halt the ramp-up in oil production keenly awaited by cash-strapped Libyan leaders and consumer countries alike . 
Control Risk 's Henry Smith said installations in the remote Fezzan region were an easy target for roaming militia who could strike , then swiftly disappear back into the desert . 
`` The most significant security threats to oil assets are in the Ubari sand sea , broadly between Ghadames , Sabha and Ghat . 
It is not secure and anyone who has been there will tell you it will remain difficult to police , particularly given the lack of a central security force , '' he said . 
Oil facilities have already been attacked by pro-Gaddafi forces this summer , and in September the Ras Lanuf refinery and export terminal in eastern Libya was ambushed and 17 killed despite being behind NTC lines and supposedly protected by the eastern brigades . 
`` There 's a high risk of hit-and-run attacks on oil workers , blowing up pumping stations or shooting down aircraft that carry people and equipment to fields in the Ubari and Murzuq basins , '' said Firas Abi Ali , referring to parts of southwest Libya . 
Both consultants warned that the risk was higher because of the number of unsecured weapons in the country left over from the conflict , including anti-aircraft missiles . 
Turkish Airlines has resumed commercial flights to Libya despite the no-fly zone but other carriers have been more cautious . 
British Airways , for instance saying it would not resume operations before a NATO no-fly zone was lifted . 
Even some Libyan oil workers are apprehensive about returning to desert oilfields after some of the facilities were sabotaged by militia . 
`` If they find out people are here they might come back , '' said an oilfield manager in the region .

2011-10-17,"Ibrahim Med Khaled , a 24-year-old taxi driver shows the wounds caused by anti-Gaddafi fighters who beat him with an electrical cable , at the displaced persons camp in Benghazi October 15 , 2011 . 
BENGHAZI , Libya | Mon Oct 17 , 2011 3:25 pm EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - After weeks on the run , thousands of black Libyans driven from their homes during the revolt against Muammar Gaddafi have resurfaced across the country , finding refuge in a squalid camp they hope is only temporary . 
Once residents of Gaddafi 's stronghold of Tawergha , the families now wander a dusty compound ringed with garbage and staffed by a handful of volunteers from the city of Benghazi struggling to prevent the spread of disease as numbers swell . 
The group 's eastward flight began last summer , when anti-Gaddafi forces overran Tawergha and vengeance-seeking crowds ransacked it , leaving a ghost town behind . 
`` They chased us with guns and knives , '' said Ibrahim Med Khaled , a 24-year-old taxi driver recently arrived at the former construction site after spending weeks dodging hostile crowds across the country 's west before being captured by armed men . 
`` They brought me to a house and beat me with electrical cable to make me confess I worked for Gaddafi , even though I told them I never carried a gun , '' he said , lifting his shirt to reveal shoulders criss-crossed with fresh wounds from flogging . 
Throughout the uprising against Gaddafi 's 42-year rule , his opponents have accused him of hiring fighters from neighboring African countries which led to reports of mistreatment of blacks , including Libyans . 
The camp has grown since opening from 400 to nearly 3,000 people in just two weeks , despite disrepair and lack of sufficient sanitation and electricity evidenced by raw sewage pooling behind some of the housing blocks . 
Aid workers say overcrowding is forcing hundreds to set up makeshift settlements near by . 
Some of the men at the camp , guarded by troops loyal to the interim government which ousted Gaddafi , still wear camouflage trousers they may have donned last summer in support of Gaddafi . 
One little girl could be seen eating spilled food off the ground . 
`` We have a big heath problem here , '' said Randa Muftah Salem-Oun , a 23-year-old medical student now head doctor at the site , where her day begins at dawn and ends after midnight . 
`` We need many supplies , wound dressings and medicine , '' she said , adding that many at the camp suffered from gastroenteritis - a telltale sign of contaminated food or water - and that hepatitis was also discovered among the sick . 
However dire the conditions may be , the camp 's residents say they are torn between desire to return , and fear of reprisals from heavily armed locals still bitter from one of the bloodiest episodes in Libya 's civil war . 
Many accuse men from Tawergha of committing atrocities in the siege of the city of Misrata , and tales of raping sprees by sub-Saharan African mercenaries - fueled in one version by Viagra doled out by Gaddafi - abound in Libya , leaving dark-skinned people suspect to some of their countrymen . 
Another former Tawergha resident , a 38-year-old mother of four named Rabha Mouftah , said there was no doubt as to the intentions of the mob that stormed into her town last summer . 
`` They came to kill black people , '' she said in a room with no lighting she now shares with her family off an alley strewn with debris . 
`` We were scared to go outside , so we hid in different houses for seven weeks , then came here . '' 
The Tawergha displaced add yet another delicate task to the growing workload of Libya 's interim rulers , the National Transitional Council , -LRB- NTC -RRB- as they try to reunify the country and impose the rule of law amid renewed opposition from Gaddafi loyalists , who launched attacks in the capital Tripoli last week for the first time since it fell in August . 
It also highlights a potential future division in the post-Gaddafi era as leaders strive to integrate a legion of factions , such as the Tuarag , a black tribe of nomads some of whom still support the ousted leader . 
Some groups have reported arbitrary arrests across the country on suspicion of collusion with the former leader , believed to be somewhere in Libya 's vast southern desert . 
While the NTC favors the return of Tawargha 's residents , it admits this will take time . 
But resolving the issue remains a test of its leadership to come . 
Much of the city lays in ruins and people in neighboring Misrata say tensions are still too high to allow a return that could spark more violence . 
`` In the end it 's another ghost of Gaddafi -- he paid many of the tribes to fight for him , so now people see black people and immediately assume they support him , even if they do n't , '' said Imad Eddin , an anesthesiologist volunteering at the camp .

2011-10-18,"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -LRB- L -RRB- shakes hands with Libya 's National Transitional Council Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril after they spoke at the World Islamic Call Society Headquarters during Clinton 's visit to Tripoli in Libya October 18 , 2011 . 
TRIPOLI | Tue Oct 18 , 2011 7:39 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made an unannounced visit to Libya on Tuesday to cement relations with the new leaders Washington helped install , offer aid and encourage them to follow through on a promise of swift elections . 
Clinton arrived in Tripoli aboard a U.S. military aircraft to begin the one-day visit during which she was scheduled to meet leaders from the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , civil society activists and staff of the newly re-opened U.S. embassy . 
She will announce a set of new programs designed to foster closer U.S.-Libyan ties including U.S. help for treating fighters wounded in Libya 's insurrection , resuming student exchange programs and more help for Libya 's effort to track down and destroy dangerous Gaddafi-era weaponry . 
Clinton is the most senior U.S. official to visit Tripoli since rebel forces battling longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi seized the capital in August with the help of NATO warplanes . 
U.S. officials said her visit underscored Washington 's hope to work with Libya 's new leaders as they guide the country toward elections and begin to reform its economy . 
The United States took part in the NATO bombing campaign that helped install the NTC in power , although it was mostly in a support role with France and Britain in the lead . 
The French and British leaders visited Tripoli together last month . 
Clinton 's visit was secret prior to her arrival in Tripoli and marked by tight security . 
U.S. officials said Clinton would discuss Libya 's plans for political transition with NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , de facto prime minister Mahmoud Jibril and Ali Tarhouni , who holds both the finance and oil portfolios . 
NTC forces are still fighting against remaining Gaddafi loyalists in his hometown Sirte and other pockets of resistance , while they are also seeking to bring under centralized control the plethora of rebel militias which sprang up in the revolt . 
A senior U.S. official traveling with Clinton told reporters Clinton would discuss security while stressing the importance of the NTC sticking to its plan for an eight-month timeline toward elections once the country is fully under its control . 
`` The important thing is to be able to show the Libyan people that there is momentum , '' the official said . 
`` We 're pushing the -LRB- NTC -RRB- to be able to show the Libyan people that they 're serious in their commitments to transition , that they 're serious in their commitments to rule of law , that they 're serious about getting to those elections . '' 
The United States has contributed a total of about $ 140 million in aid to Libya since the start of the uprising . 
Clinton was expected to unveil funding for several more initiatives . 
She will increase to about $ 40 million the U.S. contribution toward Libya 's effort to track down and destroy weapons including shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles that western officials fear could fall into militant hands . 
Libya was thought to have had about 20,000 such missiles when the war against Gaddafi began in February . 
While large numbers were destroyed in NATO air strikes , experts believe many are still unaccounted for and NATO countries have said there is an urgent need to track them down . 
Clinton will also announce new U.S. programs to help the NTC care for fighters wounded in the war , including working with the private sector to re-equip Libya 's hospitals and clinics , set up a patient tracking system and possibly bring some of the most severely wounded to the United States for treatment . 
The United Nations has estimated that about 15,000 fighters were wounded in Libya 's war including about 1,500 amputees . 
U.S. officials say helping the NTC care for these casualties could help cement political support for the interim council . 
`` This has humanitarian aspects , but it also has political ramifications : that the people who fought for Libya 's future , fought for the new Libya , can be cared for by Libya 's governing institutions , '' the senior U.S. official said .

2011-10-19,"Anti-Gaddafi fighters fire a rocket during clashes with pro-Gaddafi forces at the frontline in Sirte October 19 , 2011 . 
SIRTE , Libya | Wed Oct 19 , 2011 11:59 pm BST SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan interim government fighters have renewed their offensive on the besieged town of Sirte after being pushed back by die-hard Muammar Gaddafi loyalists holed up in the deposed leader 's home town . 
Hundreds of National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- troops have surrounded the Mediterranean coastal town for weeks in a chaotic struggle to snuff out the last pocket of resistance against the revolution that ended Gaddafi 's 42-year rule . 
Grad rockets , artillery and tank fire rained down on pro-Gaddafi positions in the center of the town on Wednesday . 
Asked about the government forces ' slow progress in taking Sirte , one NTC fighter at the front said : `` All we can think of is catching the rat Gaddafi . 
We are taking it slowly , step by step . 
We have been patient for 42 years . '' 
NTC fighters have deployed an arsenal of homemade weapons . 
On Wednesday a bulldozer arrived at the front fitted with armor and resembling a small ship , with a pointed prow and port holes . 
On its front was mounted a tank turret and the sides were made from concrete sandwiched between steel plate . 
A man wearing a black ship 's captain 's hat with gold braid sat atop the contraption as it manoeuvred into place , ploughing into a lamp-post in the process . 
Government fighters shouted `` Allahu Akbar '' -LRB- God is greatest -RRB- as it made its lumbering progress towards make-shift barricades of vehicles and shipping containers put up by Gaddafi loyalists . 
The NTC 's failure to seize Sirte , nearly two months since the fall of Tripoli , has raised questions about its ability to exert its authority over the entire country and has postponed the launch of its promised democracy program . 
On Monday , NTC forces captured the other main Gaddafi stronghold , the desert town of Bani Walid , where the ousted leader 's loyalists had put up resistance for two months . 
NTC forces were poised a few days ago to declare victory in Sirte , but on Tuesday they were forced to retreat in some places under intense fire . 
But a day later , NTC fighters had taken back the lost ground and made further gains so that for the first time government forces attacking from the east and west could see each other 's positions through the Gaddafi-held enclave . 
Fighters reported Gaddafi soldiers had been firing at them wearing civilian clothes so had stepped up security and were closely checking the identities of everyone at the front , including reporters . 
But faced with a disciplined and determined force , many NTC fighters theorised the defenders may be guarding a high-value target , perhaps even Gaddafi himself . 
`` Why else would a sniper try to take on a tank ? '' 
asked Jafar Al Sharif who commands some eight tanks positioned in the streets of Sirte pounding the low-rise apartment blocks housing Gaddafi remaining loyalists . 
The NTC offensive , by mostly amateur fighters , has been hampered by a lack of coordination . 
Units which converged on Sirte from Benghazi in eastern Libya and Misrata to the west have lost men when they fired at each other by mistake . 
Gaddafi , wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of ordering the killing of civilians , is in hiding , possibly deep in Libya 's Sahara desert . 
Inspired by protests in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt that ended in the overthrow of long-standing autocratic leaders , Libyans rose up against Gaddafi in February , but it took six months of civil war to end his one-man rule . 
The NTC lent its backing to another regional revolt on Wednesday , officially recognizing as Syria 's legitimate authority an umbrella opposition council struggling to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad . 
While Gaddafi himself is still at large , his wife , two sons and a daughter fled to neighbouring Algeria shortly after Tripoli was captured by the NTC in August . 
Algeria 's foreign minister said his country let them in for `` humanitarian reasons . '' 
The NTC at the time called it an `` act of aggression , '' but has since moved to patch up ties with Algeria . 
`` Algeria has systematically honored all its obligations as a member of the international community , '' Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told a news conference in Algiers alongside British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Wednesday . 
Hague , on a tour of the region , said he respected Algeria 's position but had requested all countries in the region honor obligations to turn over any indicted war crimes suspects .

2011-10-20,"SIRTE , Libya | Thu Oct 20 , 2011 6:31 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Disturbing images of a blood-stained and shaken Muammar Gaddafi being dragged around by angry fighters quickly circulated around the world after the Libyan dictator 's dramatic death near his home town of Sirte . 
The exact circumstances of his demise are still unclear with conflicting accounts of his death . 
But the footage of the last chaotic moments of Gaddafi 's life offered some clues into what happened . 
Gaddafi was still alive when he was captured near Sirte . 
In the video , filmed by a bystander in the crowd and later aired on television , Gaddafi is shown dazed and wounded being dragged off a vehicle 's bonnet and pulled to the ground by his hair . 
`` Keep him alive , keep him alive ! '' 
Gaddafi then goes out of view and gunshots ring out . 
`` They captured him alive and while he was being taken away , they beat him and then they killed him , '' one senior source in the NTC told Reuters . 
`` He might have been resisting . '' 
In what appeared to contradict the events depicted in the video , Libya 's ruling National Transitional Council said Gaddafi was killed when a gunfight broke out after his capture between his supporters and government fighters . 
He died from a bullet wound to the head , the prime minister said . 
The NTC said no order had been given to kill him . 
Gaddafi called the rebels who rose up against his 42 years of one-man rule `` rats , '' but in the end it appeared that it was he who was captured cowering in a drainage pipe full of rubbish and filth . 
`` He called us rats , but look where we found him , '' said Ahmed Al Sahati , a 27-year-old government fighter , standing next to two stinking drainage pipes under a six-lane highway near Sirte . 
On the ground , government fighters described scenes of carnage as they told stories of Gaddafi 's final hours . 
Shortly before dawn prayers , Gaddafi , surrounded by a few dozen loyal bodyguards and accompanied by the head of his now non-existent army Abu Bakr Younis Jabr , broke out of the two-month siege of Sirte and made a break for the west . 
They did not get far . 
France said its aircraft struck military vehicles belonging to Gaddafi forces near Sirte at about 8:30 a.m. -LRB- 0630 GMT -RRB- , but said it was unsure whether the strikes had killed Gaddafi . 
A NATO official said the convoy was hit either by a French plane or a U.S. Predator drone . 
Two miles west of Sirte , 15 pick-up trucks mounted with machine guns lay burned out , smashed and smoldering next to an electricity substation 20 meters from the main road . 
They had clearly been hit by a force far beyond anything the motley army the former rebels has assembled during eight months of revolt to overthrow the once feared leader . 
There was no bomb crater , indicating the strike may have been carried out by a jet fighter . 
Inside the trucks still in their seats sat the charred skeletal remains of drivers and passengers killed instantly by the strike . 
Other bodies lay mutilated and contorted strewn across the grass . 
Some 50 bodies in all . 
Mansour Daou , leader of Gaddafi 's personal bodyguards , was with the former strongman shortly before his end . 
He told al Arabiya television that after the air strike the survivors had `` split into groups and each group went its own way . '' 
`` I was with Gaddafi and Abu Bakr Younis Jabr and about four volunteer soldiers . '' 
Daou said he had not witnessed his leader 's death because he had fallen unconscious after being wounded in the back by a shell explosion . 
Fighters on the ground said Gaddafi and a handful of his men appeared to have run through a stand of trees and taken refuge in the two drainage pipes . 
`` At first we fired at them with anti-aircraft guns , but it was no use , '' said Salem Bakeer , while being feted by his comrades near the road . 
`` Then we went in on foot . 
`` One of Gaddafi 's men came out waving his rifle in the air and shouting surrender , but as soon as he saw my face he started shooting at me , '' he told Reuters . 
`` Then I think Gaddafi must have told them to stop . 
` My master is here , my master is here ' , he said , ` Muammar Gaddafi is here and he is wounded ' , '' said Bakeer . 
`` We went in and brought Gaddafi out . 
He was saying ` what 's wrong ? 
What 's going on ? ' . 
Then we took him and put him in the car , '' Bakeer said . 
At the time of his capture , Gaddafi was already wounded with gunshots to his leg and to his back , Bakeer said . 
Other government fighters who said they took part in Gaddafi 's capture , separately confirmed Bakeer 's version of events , though one said the man who ruled Libya for 42 years was shot and wounded at the last minute by one of his own men . 
`` One of Muammar Gaddafi 's guards shot him in the chest , '' said Omran Jouma Shawan . 
There were also other versions of events . 
NTC official Abdel Majid Mlegta told Reuters Gaddafi had been finally cornered in a compound in Sirte after hours of fighting , and wounded in a gun battle with NTC forces . 
He said Gaddafi kept repeating `` What is the matter ? 
What 's going on ? 
What do you want ? '' 
and resisted as NTC fighters seized him . 
He added that Gaddafi died of his wounds as he was being transported in an ambulance . 
`` He was bleeding from his stomach . 
It took a long time to transport him . 
He bled to death -LRB- in the ambulance -RRB- , '' he said . 
Another NTC official , speaking to Reuters anonymously , gave a violent account of Gaddafi 's death : `` They -LRB- NTC fighters -RRB- beat him very harshly and then they killed him . 
This is a war . '' 
Some video footage showed what appeared to be Gaddafi 's lifeless body being loaded into an ambulance in Sirte . 
One of the fighters who said he took part in the capture brandished a heavily engraved golden pistol he said he had taken from Gaddafi . 
Fallen electricity cables partially covered the entrance to the pipes and the bodies of three men , apparently Gaddafi bodyguards lay at the entrance to one end , one in shorts probably due to a bandaged wound on his leg . 
Four more bodies lay at the other end of the pipes . 
All black men , one had his brains blown out , another man had been decapitated , his dreadlocked head lying beside his torso . 
Army chief Jabr was also captured alive , Bakeer said . 
NTC officials later announced he was dead . 
Joyous government fighters fired their weapons in the air , shouted `` Allahu Akbar '' and posed for pictures . 
Others wrote graffiti on the concrete parapets of the highway . 
One said simply : `` Gaddafi was captured here . ''

Could n't have happened to a more repugnant piece of scum . 
He ended up in a way similar to one of his kindred spirits , Benito Mussolini !

2011-10-20,"LONDON | Thu Oct 20 , 2011 11:46 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Jockeying for power among Libya 's well-armed and fractious new leadership may intensify after the death of deposed autocrat Muammar Gaddafi , an anxious and , for many , joyous moment in a country hungry for stability and impatient to swap the bullet for the ballot box . 
The interim government will be determined to ensure that lingering pro-Gaddafi forces are prevented from launching any rearguard guerrilla insurgency from the countryside that could destabilize the north African OPEC member and its oil industry . 
One of Gaddafi 's most politically influential sons , Saif al-Islam , and his security chief Abdullah Sanussi are apparently still at large and may still be able to recruit armed followers . 
But perhaps the most important test for the interim National Transitional Council will be to manage the enormous expectations of Libya 's 6 million people , now freed definitively from the fear that Gaddafi could ever reimpose his long strongman rule . 
`` There is now this massive expectation . 
Up to now they 've had an excuse that they are running a war . 
They do n't have that now ... Everything now has got to happen , '' John Hamilton , a Libya expert at Cross Border Information , told Reuters . 
`` That 's a hard task . 
They have to deliver for the people ... On the other hand , this may renew the honeymoon they enjoyed when Tripoli fell , if they can put a decent government together in a short time . '' 
The news of Gaddafi 's capture and killing came minutes after reports that his hometown Sirte had fallen amid raids by NATO warplanes , extinguishing the last significant resistance by loyalist forces . 
The capture of Sirte and the death of Gaddafi means Libya 's ruling NTC should now begin the task of forging a new democratic system which it had said it would get under way after the city , built as a showpiece for Gaddafi 's rule , had fallen . 
Some fear instability may linger and unsettle that process . 
`` Gaddafi is now a martyr and thus can become the rallying point for irredentist or tribal violence -- perhaps not in the immediate future but in the medium-to-long term , '' said George Joffe , a north Africa expert at Cambridge University . 
`` The fact that NATO can be blamed for his death is worrying , in terms of regional support , and may undermine the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council . '' 
But the interim NTC authorities are also faced with a possibly more critical task , namely getting under control a clutch of anti-Gaddafi armed militias competing , so far peacefully , for ample share of funding and political representation in a post-Gaddafi Libya . 
Libya expert Alex Warren , of Frontier MEA , a Middle East and north Africa research and advisory firm , said the death of Gaddafi `` is clearly a momentous event and far more than just a symbolic one . '' 
But he added , of the NTC militias : `` These groups need to be either carefully disbanded or integrated into the armed forces ... Questions remain about who these militias answer to , how they manage their relationships with each other and what their demands are . '' 
Under rules drawn up by revolutionary forces who overthrew Gaddafi in September , the fall of Sirte will lead to an official declaration that Libya is liberated , which will set in motion a process toward democratic elections . 
On declaring liberation , the NTC will move its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli and form a transitional government within 30 days . 
A 200-member national conference is to be elected within 240 days , and this will appoint a prime minister a month later who will nominate his government . 
The national conference is to be given deadlines to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of elections for a parliament . 
Some worry that the politicking involved in forming a new government in the coming days may strain to the limit the alliance of convenience between provincial forces that constituted the armed opposition to Gaddafi . 
Now he is gone , the glue that held the alliance together may fade . 
Warren said it was not clear whether the current NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , widely seen as the most widely supported politician in the NTC , would step down or not . 
`` In the current absence of any other organized political institutions , it is vital that there is leadership to oversee crucial elements of the transition , including the licensing of political parties , the organization of elections , and the disbanding or reintegration of militias , '' he said . 
In recent weeks Tripoli has seen an apparent competition for the title of top militia in the capital , where the many armed groups now exercising authority in the city portrayed themselves as the sole legitimate security force . 
U.S. Republican Senator John McCain called on the NTC during a visit to Libya last month to move quickly to get the armed groups under their control . 
`` This is an end of one era but the fight over the new government has started already , '' said Ali Abdullatif Ahmida , a Libyan political scientist at the University of New England . 
`` It all depends on how the NTC leadership heals the country and reconciles people ... or takes revenge and settles scores . 
That may be a dangerous road . ''

2011-10-20,"Thu , Oct 20 19:15 PM EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - NATO is to formally decide on Wednesday whether to end its mission over Libya now that Muammar Gaddafi is dead and buried and the country 's new leaders have declared the nation `` liberated '' . 
The likely decision to end the alliance 's patrols over the skies of Libya at the end of the month marks another milestone in what the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- has pledged will be a road toward democracy and free and fair elections in 2013 . 
But the deaths of Gaddafi and his son Mo ` tassim after both were captured wounded but alive on Thursday and the grisly public display of their decomposing bodies in a Misrata meat locker have made the NTC 's Western backers uneasy about Libya 's prospects for stable government and respect for the rule of law . 
Gaddafi and Mo ` tassim were buried in a secret desert location on Tuesday to prevent their graves becoming a shrine for any remaining followers in the oil-rich North African state . 
Under pressure from Western allies , the NTC promised on Monday to investigate how Gaddafi and his son were killed . 
Mobile phone footage shows both alive after their capture . 
The former leader was seen being mocked , beaten and abused before he died , in what NTC officials say was crossfire . 
The treatment of others who supported Gaddafi and fought alongside him was now an issue , said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman . 
`` This is a test . 
The NTC has repeatedly said that they will distinguish themselves from the Gaddafi regime in terms of the respect of human rights and the rule of law , '' he told a news conference in Morocco . 
`` Now is the time for them to begin actions that will help them reinforce these words . '' 
Emerging from 42 years of often brutal one-man rule , many Libyans are savoring the end of eight months of bitter civil war won with NATO 's backing and are unconcerned about how Gaddafi met his end and how his body was treated afterwards . 
`` Throw him in a hole , in the sea , in garbage . 
He is lower than a donkey or a dog and only foreigners say they care about how we killed him . 
And they are lying , '' said engineer Ali Azzarog , 47 . 
Hatred of Gaddafi unified his disparate opponents , who will likely now tussle for power during a planned transition to democracy in a nation riven with regional and tribal rivalries . 
With economic problems at home , NATO countries are expected to endorse an end to their U.N.-mandated mission in Libya when their ambassadors meet in Brussels on Wednesday after a preliminary decision last week to end it on October 31 . 
`` We said that we would consult closely with the United Nations and the NTC and that process of consultations is ongoing , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said . 
Libyan interim Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said he wanted NATO to maintain its mission for another month , but hoped for a swift end to United Nations sanctions to free up funds for the interim government to pay salaries and help reconstruction . 
NATO spokeswoman Lungescu declined to say whether NATO might extend the mission . 
`` I do n't know whether there is a formal request . 
All these things remain to be sorted out . 
But in the end this is a political decision , '' she said . 
NATO 's Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs and Security Policy , James Appathurai , said he expected the alliance to confirm its decision to end the mission . 
`` I do n't expect that there will be a change to that decision , because it is quite clear that the pro-Gaddafi elements no longer have the command and control or other capabilities to pose an organized threat to civilians . 
That is now finished , and as a result our operation will end , '' he said . 
Western military powers have already begun winding down the Libyan mission , and diplomats have said the majority of NATO equipment , including fighter jets , has already been withdrawn . 
A NATO statement on Tuesday said operations in the interim would involve intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance missions , although NATO would retain the capability to conduct air strikes if they were needed . 
The one remaining element from the old order is Gaddafi 's sons , the enigmatic Saif al-Islam , who remains on the run . 
Once viewed as a moderate reformer , he vowed to help his father crush his enemies once the revolt began . 
An NTC official said Saif al-Islam was in the southern desert near Niger and Algeria and was set to flee Libya using a false passport .

2011-10-20,"LONDON | Thu Oct 20 , 2011 6:51 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Jockeying for power among Libya 's well-armed and fractious new leadership may intensify after the death of Muammar Gaddafi , an anxious and , for many , joyous moment in a country hungry for stability and impatient to swap the bullet for the ballot box . 
The interim government will be determined to ensure that lingering pro-Gaddafi forces are prevented from launching any rearguard guerrilla insurgency from the countryside that could destabilize the north African OPEC member and its oil industry . 
Gaddafi 's death is expected to allow Libya to start earning money again by selling its oil on world markets as a more benign security environment allows oilfield staff to get back to work . 
But perhaps the most important test for the interim National Transitional Council will be to manage the enormous expectations of Libya 's 6 million people , now freed definitively from the fear that Gaddafi could ever reimpose his long strongman rule . 
`` There is now this massive expectation . 
Up to now they 've had an excuse that they are running a war . 
They do n't have that now ... Everything now has got to happen , '' John Hamilton , a Libya expert at Cross Border Information , told Reuters . 
`` That 's a hard task . 
They have to deliver for the people ... On the other hand , this may renew the honeymoon they enjoyed when Tripoli fell , if they can put a decent government together in a short time . '' 
The news of Gaddafi 's capture and killing came minutes after reports that his home town Sirte had fallen amid raids by NATO warplanes , extinguishing the last significant resistance by loyalist forces . 
The capture of Sirte and the death of Gaddafi means Libya 's ruling NTC should now begin the task of forging a new democratic system which it had said it would get under way after the city , built as a showpiece for Gaddafi 's rule , had fallen . 
An announcement that the country has achieved `` liberation '' is expected on Saturday , setting in motion a transition to democratic elections . 
Some fear instability may linger and unsettle that process . 
`` Gaddafi is now a martyr and thus can become the rallying point for irredentist or tribal violence -- perhaps not in the immediate future but in the medium-to-long term , '' said George Joffe , a north Africa expert at Cambridge University . 
`` The fact that NATO can be blamed for his death is worrying , in terms of regional support , and may undermine the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council . '' 
But the interim NTC authorities are also faced with a possibly more critical task , namely getting under control a clutch of anti-Gaddafi armed militias competing , so far peacefully , for ample share of funding and political representation in a post-Gaddafi Libya . 
Libya expert Alex Warren , of Frontier MEA , a Middle East and north Africa research and advisory firm , said the death of Gaddafi `` is clearly a momentous event and far more than just a symbolic one . '' 
But he added , of the NTC militias : `` These groups need to be either carefully disbanded or integrated into the armed forces ... Questions remain about who these militias answer to , how they manage their relationships with each other and what their demands are . '' 
Under rules drawn up by revolutionary forces who overthrew Gaddafi in September , the fall of Sirte will lead to an official declaration that Libya is liberated , which will set in motion a process toward democratic elections . 
On declaring liberation , the NTC will move its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli and form a transitional government within 30 days . 
A 200-member national conference is to be elected within 240 days , and this will appoint a prime minister a month later who will nominate his government . 
The national conference is to be given deadlines to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of elections for a parliament . 
Some worry that the politicking involved in forming a new government in the coming days may strain to the limit the alliance of convenience between provincial forces that constituted the armed opposition to Gaddafi . 
Now he is gone , the glue that held the alliance together may fade . 
Warren said it was not clear whether the current NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , widely seen as the most widely supported politician in the NTC , would step down or not . 
`` In the current absence of any other organized political institutions , it is vital that there is leadership to oversee crucial elements of the transition , including the licensing of political parties , the organization of elections , and the disbanding or reintegration of militias , '' he said . 
In recent weeks Tripoli has seen an apparent competition for the title of top militia in the capital , where the many armed groups now exercising authority in the city portrayed themselves as the sole legitimate security force . 
U.S. Republican Senator John McCain called on the NTC during a visit to Libya last month to move quickly to get the armed groups under their control . 
`` This is an end of one era but the fight over the new government has started already , '' said Ali Abdullatif Ahmida , a Libyan political scientist at the University of New England . 
`` It all depends on how the NTC leadership heals the country and reconciles people ... or takes revenge and settles scores . 
That may be a dangerous road . ''
