"Why has the American capital system run amok , taking so many for a ride ? 
According to four recent books , the complicity reaches high and low : reckless financiers , dishonest mortgage brokers , credulous consumers and home buyers . 
But the blame starts at the top , where those in charge -- the Bush administration , Congress , the Federal Reserve and financial industry leaders -- closed or averted their eyes as the crisis approached . 
THE NEW PARADIGM FOR FINANCIAL MARKETS The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What It Means By George Soros | Public Affairs . 
$ 22.95 George Soros is a billionaire speculator whose voice is amplified by real money . 
His distaste for the Bush administration runs deep : He put millions of dollars into Sen. John Kerry 's 2004 presidential campaign . 
Yet his account of the credit crash is personal and revealing , not mere political bashing . 
He admits that he did n't recognize that the crisis was about to break and came out of virtual retirement in 2007 to trade again , hoping to limit the damage to his funds . 
Soros blames former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan for not intervening to slow the mad real estate boom that led to the subprime mortgage disaster . 
Under Greenspan 's leadership , the Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates too low for too long and ignored the spread of impenetrable financial investments , such as complex mortgage-based securities , which expanded risks of default beyond any reckoning . 
When risk ca n't be figured out and markets turn down , panic often follows . 
`` The newly invented methods and instruments were so sophisticated that the regulatory authorities lost the ability to calculate the risks involved , '' Soros writes . 
He calls this a `` shocking abdication of responsibility on the part of the regulators . '' 
FINANCIAL SHOCK A 360 Degree Look at the Subprime Mortgage Implosion , and How to Avoid The Next Financial Crisis By Mark Zandi | FT. 270 pp . 
$ 24.99 Financial Shock by economist Mark Zandi is a clear primer on how and why the crisis occurred . 
Zandi is chief economist and co-founder of Moody 's Economy.com , and his even-handed analysis is often sought by journalists -LRB- including by me in my former role as a Washington Post business reporter -RRB- . 
His lucid book explains the credit default swaps -LRB- CDSs -RRB- ; structured investment vehicles -LRB- SIVs -RRB- ; collateralized debt obligations -LRB- CDOs -RRB- ; CDOs of CDOs , called CDOs-squared ; CDOs-cubed ; and other instruments of financial jabberwocky that caused the credit contagion . 
Most notorious , Zandi says , were the CDOs , `` essentially just a mutual fund for bonds and loans . '' 
These funds filled up with subprime mortgage loans whose risks were unknowable to investors . 
Financial firms pocketed lucrative fees for selling CDOs , and buyers could get them for 7 percent down , the rest borrowed . 
Such highly leveraged deals promised rich payoffs , but delivered cataclysmic losses when the bubble burst . 
It is no surprise to see someone like Soros urging effective regulation of financial market risk . 
But it is significant that Zandi , an adviser to Sen. John McCain 's presidential campaign , agrees with Soros . 
The current crisis , at bottom , is about a serious loss of confidence in U.S. financial markets . 
`` Financial markets work on trust , '' he says . 
`` Without trust , money markets quickly break down . '' 
THE WORLD IS CURVED Hidden Dangers to the Global Economy By David M. Smick | Portfolio . 
$ 26.95 A consultant and founder of the International Economy quarterly , David M. Smick takes his title from Thomas J. Friedman 's The World Is Flat . 
`` For the financial markets , '' Smick argues , `` the world is curved . 
We ca n't see over the horizon ... That is why the world has become such a dangerous place . '' 
Smick built his career through the classic Washington practice of networking and advice-giving , and his analysis is sprinkled with stories of encounters with big players in global finance . 
He describes his sweaty-palmed interview with Singapore 's legendary leader Lee Kuan Yew , who blasted Smick for his confidence in U.S. markets , then gave him a consulting contract . 
It 's classic name-dropping , but it enlivens his account . 
Smick views the country 's economic setbacks from the perspective of a committed globalist who fears that Americans will start demanding barriers to trade and investment , provoking an even greater crisis . 
His book argues that the United States can and must compete in a world with shrinking boundaries because there really is n't another choice . 
BAD MONEY Reckless Finance , Failed Politics , And the Global Crisis of American Capitalism By Kevin Phillips | Viking . 
$ 25.95 Kevin Phillips is alarmed by the increasing gap in wealth between the richest Americans and the rest of the population . 
Other analysts see this trend coming from political choices , the unplanned chaos of global markets and individual avarice . 
Phillips , author of American Dynasty and American Theocracy , spies the shadowy hand of the financial elite pulling the strings . 
According to him , since the 1980s , Wall Street and its Washington allies have set out to tie the U.S. economy to the money sector and let manufacturing companies and factory workers fall by the wayside . 
`` The flight of the economy from tangibles to money manipulation is enriching a broad cross section of the upper-echelon institutions and practitioners of U.S. finance , '' he writes . 
He blames this nefarious plan for the current economic crisis and argues that it dooms the United States to second-class status , behind China . 
The pitch of Phillips 's alarms has led one reviewer to call him a modern Thomas Paine . 
But the sweep of his claims creates a big burden of proof that he does n't even attempt to meet . 
Is there a powerful cabal at work to carry out a sinister `` financialization '' of the U.S. economy ? 
Phillips ducks : `` This book will not try to prove or disprove any particular backstage role '' by Wall Street and Washington power brokers . 
He is `` not interested in becoming a conspiracy investigator , '' he insists . 
But his work edges closer to Dan Brown 's than he should want . 
Of the four books , Zandi 's account of the internal threats to U.S. prosperity is most clinical while Smick provides a global perspective . 
Soros , who calls himself a `` failed philosopher '' attempts in his tenth book to put this crisis into a complex theoretical context and asks readers to make one more try to grasp it . 
All four authors agree on the growing vulnerability of American financial well-being . 
Alone among the major economies , the United States is critically dependent on countries that sell us oil , electronics and the things that fill our shopping bags . 
Americans have stopped saving . 
The Bush administration and Congress have let budget deficits fly . 
And now the country relies on foreigners to plow dollars back in to keep the economy going . 
The authors warn that this financial dependence , like our energy dependence , is eroding the nation 's choices . 
These four experts see the credit shock as a probable turning point toward an even tougher future . 
Budget deficits will have to be faced . 
Painful spending decisions on health care and social security must be made . 
The economy 's rewards must flow more fairly . 
`` Henceforth , American consumers ... have to find ways to live within their means , '' Zandi says . 
`` Their unlimited freedom to spend , as well as their dominant role in the global economy , -LRB- has -RRB- reached an end . ''

"Financial Rescues Show That Faith in Free Market Is Shaken Self-reliance . 
A faith in free markets and a belief that people should have the opportunity to fail or succeed on the basis of their hard work and ingenuity . 
These are qualities that have been as central to the national identity as they have been to the American economic model . 
Which is why it is so extraordinary that the government now finds itself hip-deep in the direct management of the financial system , rescuing four of the country 's biggest financial institutions -- Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and now Lehman Brothers -- from the harsh discipline of markets and the consequences of their own misjudgments . 
This unprecedented intrusion of government is coming in the waning days of the administration of a Republican president who made privatization , deregulation and a faith in free markets the centerpiece of his economic policies and of his political agenda . 
But now , facing the very real risk of a global financial meltdown and the prospect that he could go down in economic history compared to Herbert Hoover rather than Ronald Reagan , the president and his appointees have decided to set aside their principles in favor of economic and political pragmatism . 
It was only a decade ago , after the heads of some of Wall Street 's biggest banks and investment houses were invited to a meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and merely encouraged to mount a private rescue for a failing hedge fund , that there were howls of protest from both the left and the right about undue interference . 
Although no public money was involved , nor any exercise of regulatory powers , the Fed 's behind-the-scenes effort to prevent the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management was seen as an abandonment of free-market principles . 
Today , those objections seem almost quaint . 
In March , the Fed agreed to lend J.P. Morgan Chase $ 29 billion to finance the purchase of Bear Stearns at a price and on terms effectively dictated by the secretary of the Treasury . 
And to forestall the risk of other failures , the Fed for the first time opened its lending window to investment banks that were not normally subject to its regulatory oversight . 
Then , last weekend , the government used its broad regulatory powers to force Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to accept a federal takeover that could potentially require taxpayers to lend or invest hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up not only the two housing giants but also the depressed market for mortgage-backed securities . 
Now , officials from the Fed and the Treasury are carefully orchestrating the breakup and sale of Lehman Brothers to rivals and investors . 
Although it is unclear whether any government money or guarantees will be involved , there is a chance that a part of the venerable Wall Street firm will wind up in the hands of a foreign bank . 
If these actions had been taken in Moscow , Paris , Beijing or even Brasilia , they would have seemed merely confirmation of long-standing socialist instincts and traditions . 
But in Washington , they are revolutionary . 
As with the Great Depression , it has taken a full-blown financial crisis to shake the faith that free markets will always deliver better outcomes than politicians and bureaucrats . 
It will be several years , and probably several more rescues and interventions , before the crisis has subsided . 
There is already talk of $ 25 billion to $ 50 billion in federal loans to the auto industry , along with an economic stimulus package chock full of `` public investments . '' 
And there is a consensus , even among Republicans , that financial deregulation went too far and that a new and more robust regulatory architecture will be needed . 
But even after the economy has recovered and financial markets return to normal , a generation of Americans that has lived through the savings-and-loan crisis of the '80s , the Internet bubble of the '90s and the current credit crisis is likely to retain both a lingering suspicion of unregulated markets and a willingness to use the powers and resources of government to enhance economic stability . 
"
"The U.S. financial system this weekend faced its gravest crisis in modern times , as regulators resorted to triage on Wall Street to contain the spreading damage from a meltdown in the housing and mortgage market . 
Two of the world 's biggest investment banks , Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers , appeared almost certain to disappear , Merrill into the arms of banking behemoth Bank of America and Lehman into bankruptcy . 
American International Group , once the country 's largest insurer , was seeking a financial lifeline . 
This came just seven days after the government took over housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
For all the drama of the weekend , these were the first steps -- but far from the last -- in finding a fundamentally new architecture for the financial world . 
The titans of Wall Street have , over the past 72 hours , been forced to reckon with the reality that the financial sector they built is , in its current form , too big , uses too much borrowed money and creates too much risk for the broader economy . 
In a weekend of intensive and almost nonstop meetings behind the massive stone facade of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and New York Fed President Timothy F. Geithner oversaw a series of meetings that essentially forced the chief executives of every major firm to grapple with a crisis of their own making . 
The work proceeded along parallel tracks . 
Paulson and Geithner were trying to find a buyer for Lehman Brothers . 
But from the beginning , they were also running meetings to try to game out the problems that could result if Lehman did fail . 
This morning will offer an acid test of whether that contingency planning was enough . 
However things go on Wall Street and financial capitals around the world today , the reworking of the global financial system will continue apace . 
Among the issues likely to be scrutinized : How much of a day-to-day role should the government and regulators take in financial markets ? 
Which agencies should oversee financial institutions ? 
Should the basics of the financial world be rethought ? 
Paulson has offered a blueprint to overhaul this financial regulation , and Congress plans to take it up next year . 
The deepening of the financial crisis will almost certainly make that effort more pressing . 
Wall Street firms have been allowed to grow with relatively few restrictions ; the regulator that oversees their financial soundness , the Securities and Exchange Commission , is historically more focused on protecting investors than preventing a run on a bank . 
Indeed , the investment banks -- there were , as of March , five major ones , but after this weekend there now appear set to be only three -- agreed voluntarily to that `` prudential supervision . '' 
The Federal Reserve , the agency that has more explicit focus than any other on rooting out risks to the financial system , has little authority over institutions that are n't commercial bank holding companies . 
Regulators of all stripes have had difficulty getting the information they need to fully understand the risks that financial firms are taking . 
The $ 50 trillion corporate derivatives market is a model of obscurity . 
The same could be said of many structured debt products , which slice up mortgages , credit card debts , or corporate loans in such ways that understanding how risky they are requires a PhD in mathematics . 
Indeed , it is increasingly clear that Wall Street chief executives themselves did n't fully understand the risks they were taking on during the boom years of this decade ; they have seemed as blindsided as any regulator . 
The problems on Wall Street may go deeper . 
Financial firms have expanded vastly in the past decade , hiring tens of thousands of bright business school graduates to engineer new financial products , find ever more complicated ways to manage other peoples ' money , and dream up new ways to combine , divide , and recombine corporate America . 
Some large portion of that work , it now appears , was n't really creating any value for the company 's clients or for the U.S. economy . 
No matter how many times crummy mortgage loans are recombined into clever packages , they 're still crummy . 
In a perfect world , those excesses would be corrected by a gradual , orderly decline , in which a few firms get bought out by competitors , some modest layoffs occur , and Wall Street cuts back on its hiring for a few years . 
In the real world , that correction is occurring before our eyes , through a series of convulsive weekends in which the entire financial world appears at risk of coming off the rails . 
So far , the conflagration has only singed the broader U.S. economy . 
Gross domestic product grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter , and the unemployment rate has risen sharply this year but , at 6.1 percent , is not as high as it has been in past bad economic times . 
The question that remains is : How much more of Wall Street 's problems can the rest of America take ? '' 
"
"In taking the top job at Treasury two years ago , Hank Paulson said he would n't be content to keep the seat warm . 
He was running Goldman Sachs , the preeminent investment bank , and he had no need to come to Washington if he was n't going to make an impact . 
Until Sunday , it was pretty hard to see where Paulson 's impact lay . 
His environmental interests had not caused a sprouting of green policies . 
His strong contacts in China had fostered a bilateral talkfest but no tangible breakthroughs . 
And his efforts to manage the financial crisis had been conventional and tentative -- until his bold gamble on Lehman Brothers . 
President Bush 's first Treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , trumpeted his distaste for bailouts while still bailing out Argentina , Brazil and Turkey . 
Paulson began in similar vein , declaring his belief in markets while presiding over the March bailout of Bear Stearns , extending credit from the Fed 's discount window to all investment banks , and nationalizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two monster mortgage-lending companies . 
Going into the weekend , most people assumed that Paulson would do the same again . 
But instead he refused to extend taxpayer-backed loans to Lehman , causing prospective buyers of the firm to walk away and forcing Lehman to declare bankruptcy . 
After the Bear Stearns bailout , it seemed that a new financial doctrine had been born . 
It used to be said that a bank was `` too big to fail , '' meaning that its collapse would cause heavy losses at other banks that had lent to it , inflicting unacceptable pain on the economy . 
Bear 's rescue seemed to inaugurate the doctrine of `` too entangled to fail , '' which held that even a small bank could not be allowed to go down if it had enmeshed itself in the vast and opaque swaps markets . 
The argument was that a collapse of a major swaps player would sink the banks on the other side of those swaps . 
If , say , Morgan Stanley had controlled its exposure to a falling dollar by selling that risk to Bear , bye-bye to Bear could mean bye-bye to Morgan . 
In refusing to bail out Lehman , Paulson put an end to the too-entangled doctrine . 
He gambled that he could let Lehman fail without sowing market pandemonium , not least because Lehman 's demise had been predicted for weeks , allowing players in the swaps market to take steps to protect themselves . 
As of Monday afternoon , Paulson 's bet had generated some scary moments . 
Stocks fell , and credit markets were naturally repricing the risk of lending to banks . 
But there was no instant catastrophe . 
If Paulson 's gamble pays off , it could affect the character of globalization . 
For the past two decades or so , international finance has developed largely on U.S. terms and in the U.S. image . 
The Federal Reserve has stood behind the dollar , which is the world 's dominant reserve currency , and the world 's faith in the dollar has allowed the Fed to cut interest rates in response to global shocks such as Russia 's default in 1998 without risking a run on the currency . 
Meanwhile , U.S. banks have dreamed up funky new financial instruments that have been marketed all over the world . 
To a considerable extent , the globalization of finance has meant its Americanization . 
The first 12 months of this crisis scrambled that equation . 
The Fed cut interest rates , as it often does in response to trouble . 
But this time the world lost confidence in the dollar , which failed to play its traditional role as a safe store of value in tough times and instead seesawed wildly . 
The innovative U.S. banks lost billions of dollars and were forced to turn for help to the new masters of finance -- foreign sovereign wealth funds . 
And U.S.-style financial innovation suffered a massive reputational blow . 
No less a commentator than Paul Volcker , the former Fed chairman , has emerged to denounce it . 
The longer the financial turbulence goes on , the greater the likely backlash against U.S.-style financial globalization . 
But Paulson 's gamble -- if it succeeds -- could limit the damage . 
By refusing to use the Fed 's balance sheet to bail out Lehman , he may have saved the Fed from becoming further bogged down in its crisis-management role , freeing it to focus more on preserving the value of the dollar . 
And by repealing the too-entangled doctrine , Paulson may have strengthened market penalties for banks that mismanage modern financial instruments -- thereby increasing the chances that sophisticated , market-based finance can flourish safely . 
Shocking though it may sound now , there is much to like in U.S.-style financial globalization . 
America 's critics may be tempted to celebrate the dollar 's dethronement , but ordinary savers from Brazil to Belarus are grateful for an international store of value . 
The critics may say that the newfangled financial instruments are inherently dangerous , but this is only true when they are combined with excessive borrowing . 
The challenge over the next year or so is to preserve the good parts of the system while embracing necessary change . 
Paulson 's willingness to throw the dice has made the world hold its breath , but it shows that he knows what the stakes are .

"U.S. Seizes Control of AIG With $ 85 Billion Emergency Loan Invoking extraordinary powers granted after the 1929 stock market crash , the government seized control of the insurance giant American International Group to preserve a crucial bulwark of the global financial system . 
The move to lend the Wall Street giant up to $ 85 billion in exchange for nearly 80 percent of its stock effectively nationalizes one of the central institutions in the crisis that has swept through markets this month . 
The government had sought to avoid federal intervention by lining up private companies to rescue AIG . 
But the effort failed when companies were unwilling to take on the massive financial risk , forcing the government 's hand . 
AIG found itself on the verge of bankruptcy because of mounting losses from investments tied to subprime home mortgages and also from the insurance it was providing to others who invested in mortgages . 
When credit-rating agencies downgraded the company Monday , AIG suddenly faced a crunch to come up with $ 14.5 billion to meet its commitments . 
If the company failed , it could have set off cascading losses across the global financial system . 
`` The Board determined that , in current circumstances , a disorderly failure of AIG could add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs , reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance , '' the Fed said in a statement . 
`` It 's heavy , heavy , heavy . 
It 's much more than has been done except Fannie and Freddie , '' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- , who heads the Joint Economic Committee , referring to the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which were taken over by the government earlier this month . 
`` But when you look at the alternatives , none of them are better . '' 
Since years of loose mortgage lending caught up with the housing markets , spurring a decline in home prices and a wave of foreclosures , a contagion has spread through the financial system , infecting investors who bet on the bad debt . 
To contain the damage , the government has also intervened to prop up Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the investment bank Bear Stearns . 
Treasury officials appeared to draw a line over the weekend when they allowed the Wall Street investment house Lehman Brothers to fail , sending a signal that other firms could not count on taxpayer help . 
Government officials drew two distinctions between AIG 's situation and that of Lehman . 
First , ever since the demise of Bear Stearns in March , the government and private firms had been drawing up contingency plans for easing the collateral damage from a Lehman bankruptcy filing . 
AIG 's failure was a surprise -- the company first went to the government for help Friday -- and its sheer size and complexity made it impossible to quickly prepare for its collapse . 
The other difference is that AIG does business in ways that get to Americans ' pocketbooks . 
Its short-term debt is held by institutions all over the world , including money-market mutual funds , and its overnight collapse could have caused big losses in those funds , perhaps even risking a run on them . 
The possibility of a Fed rescue helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average more than 141 points yesterday , to close at 11,059 , recovering part of Monday 's dizzying 504-point drop . 
"
"Wall Street as we know it is kaput . 
It is not just that Merrill Lynch agreed to be purchased by Bank of America or that the legendary investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy or that the insurance giant AIG is floundering . 
It is not even that these events followed the failure of the investment bank Bear Stearns or the government 's takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the largest mortgage lenders . 
What 's really happened is that Wall Street 's business model has collapsed . 
Greed and fear , which routinely govern financial markets , have seeded this global crisis . 
Just when it will end is n't clear . 
What is clear is that its origins lie in the ways that Wall Street -- the giant investment houses , brokerage firms , hedge funds and `` private equity '' firms -- has changed since 1980 . 
Its present business model has three basic components . 
First , financial firms have moved beyond their traditional roles as advisers and intermediaries . 
Once , major investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Lehman worked mainly for their clients . 
They traded stocks and bonds for major institutional investors -LRB- insurance companies , pension funds , mutual funds -RRB- . 
They raised capital for companies by underwriting -- selling -- new stocks and bonds for the firms . 
They provided advice to corporate clients on mergers , acquisitions and spinoffs . 
All these services earned fees . 
Now , most financial firms also invest for themselves . 
They use partners ' or shareholders ' money to place bets on stocks , bonds and other securities -- so-called `` principal transactions . '' 
Merrill and other retail brokers , which once served individual clients , have ventured into investment banking . 
So have some commercial banks that were barred from doing so until the repeal in 1999 of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 . 
Second , Wall Street 's compensation is heavily skewed toward annual bonuses , reflecting the profits traders and managers earned in the year . 
Despite lavish base salaries , bonuses dominate . 
Managing directors with 15 years ' experience can receive bonuses five to 10 times their base salaries of $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 . 
Finally , investment banks rely heavily on borrowed money , called `` leverage '' in financial lingo . 
In late 2007 , it held almost $ 700 billion in stocks , bonds and other securities . 
Meanwhile , its shareholders ' investment -LRB- equity -RRB- was about $ 23 billion . 
All the rest was supported by borrowings . 
The `` leverage ratio '' was 30 to 1 . 
Leverage can create huge windfalls . 
Suppose you buy a stock for $ 100 . 
It goes to $ 110 . 
You made 10 percent , a decent return . 
Now suppose you borrowed $ 90 of the $ 100 . 
If the price rises to $ 101 , you 've made 10 percent on your $ 10 investment . 
-LRB- Technically , the price has to exceed $ 101 slightly to cover interest payments . -RRB- 
If it goes to $ 110 , you 've doubled your money . 
Once assembled , these components created a manic machine for gambling . 
Traders and money managers had huge incentives to do whatever would increase short-term profits . 
Dubious mortgages were packaged into bonds , sold and traded . 
Investment houses had huge incentives to increase leverage . 
While the boom continued , government remained aloof . 
Congress resisted tougher regulation for Fannie and Freddie and permitted them to run leverage ratios that , by plausible calculations , exceeded 60 to 1 . 
It was n't that Wall Street 's leaders deceived customers or lenders into taking risks that were known to be hazardous . 
Instead , they concluded that risks were low or nonexistent . 
They fooled themselves , because the short-term rewards blinded them to the long-term dangers . 
Inevitably , these surfaced . 
The powerful logic of high leverage went into reverse . 
Losses eroded firms ' tiny capital bases , raising doubts about their survival . 
This year , Lehman lost nearly $ 8 billion in `` principal transactions . '' 
Otherwise , it was profitable . 
How Wall Street restructures itself is as yet unclear . 
Companies need more capital . 
Merrill went to Bank of America because commercial banks have lower leverage -LRB- about 10 to 1 -RRB- . 
It seems likely that many thinly capitalized hedge funds will be forced to reduce leverage . 
Ditto for `` private equity '' firms . 
In time , all this may prove beneficial . 
Financial firms may take fewer stupid and wasteful risks -- at least for a while . 
Talented and ambitious people may move from finance , where they were attracted by exorbitant pay , into more productive industries . 
But the immediate effect may be to damage the rest of the economy . 
People have already lost their jobs . 
States and localities , particularly New York City and New Jersey , that depend on Wall Street 's profits and payrolls will face further spending cuts . 
Banks and investment banks may tighten lending standards again and impede any economic recovery . 
The stock market 's swoon may deepen consumers ' pessimism , fear and reluctance to spend . 
There may be more failures of financial firms . 
It 's hard to know , because financial crises resemble wars in one crucial respect : They result from miscalculation .

"What Not to Do in a Financial Crisis : U.S. Learns From Japan How do we avoid becoming another Japan ? 
That question has prompted U.S. officials to move aggressively in recent weeks as they seek to save the American financial system while avoiding the kinds of regulatory pitfalls that plunged Japan into economic quicksand almost two decades ago . 
Although the world 's second-largest economy buckled during a collapse of its real estate and stock markets , it was , many analysts say , government mismanagement that made the crisis even worse . 
The result was a diminishing of Japan 's economic power and global influence lasting to this day . 
After falling 66 percent from 1990 to 2005 , Japanese housing prices have climbed back to only 40 percent of their 1990 values . 
Tokyo 's key Nikkei stock index remains a dim echo of its former self , still 70 percent off its 1989 high . 
Now , U.S. officials , who long argued that the Japanese needed to be more aggressive and hands-on , appear to be practicing what they preached . 
Aided by a far more transparent financial system that has made it more difficult for U.S. banks to hide the extent of their bad bets , regulators have accelerated a reckoning for some of the most vaunted names in American finance , generating a historic upheaval on Wall Street . 
The effect , leading analysts say , could ultimately be a briefer bout of economic pain than what the long-suffering Japanese have had to endure . 
`` The U.S. is moving in dog years compared to Japan , '' said Adam Posen , deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former consultant to the U.S. government on the Japan crisis . 
`` Every one year of action here is about equal to what it took Japan seven years to do . '' 
The sharply different U.S. approach is no coincidence . 
American regulators have been actively seeking advice from Japan , hoping that a better understanding of its mistakes will aid them in navigating their own country 's financial crisis . 
Advice has largely come during frequent talks over the past year , during which U.S. financial officials met with their former and current counterparts in Japan . 
`` When things became quite turbulent in July and August of last year , we were talking to them within weeks , '' said Clay Lowery , the Treasury Department 's assistant secretary for international affairs . 
He said government officials have been in close contact with a number of other countries , including Sweden , which is credited by experts with comparatively deft handling of its financial crisis in the early 1990s . 
With the Japanese , he continued , `` we wanted to talk to them about some of their issues , some of their problems . '' 
Critics say Japanese regulators wrote the book on how not to handle a financial crisis , at first refusing to admit a problem , then moving slowly -- and often ineptly -- when they did . 
At the time , Ben S. Bernanke , then a Princeton University economist and now chairman of the Federal Reserve , was among those to fault the recipes the Japanese were using . 
It is too early to gauge whether U.S. efforts will ultimately prove more effective than those taken by the Japanese , and economists on both sides of the Pacific warn that the biggest tests probably lie ahead . 
Analysts are questioning the health of regional and mid-size banks across America , and many economists are reserving judgment until they can assess how aggressively U.S. regulators move to force complete disclosure of bad debt and consolidation within the industry . 
But the Japanese say they have marveled at the relative speed at which U.S. regulators have moved recently to sell off Bear Sterns , take over mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and encourage market solutions for Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers . 
By comparison , the Japanese came under heavy fire in the 1990s for allowing bad debt and ailing banks to linger for years .

"Scrambling to Clean Up After A Category 4 Financial Storm Robert Dugger , an economist and hedge-fund partner , says the markets have only just begun to force some financial discipline on the majority of U.S. households . 
-LRB- By Andrew Harrer -- Bloomberg News -RRB- You know you 're in a heap of trouble when the lender of last resort suddenly runs out of money . 
Having pumped $ 100 billion into the banking system and lent $ 115 billion more to rescue Bear Stearns and AIG , the Federal Reserve was forced to ask the Treasury yesterday to borrow some extra money to replenish its coffers . 
If there was any good news in that , it was that investors here and abroad were eager to help out , having decided that the only safe place to put their money is in U.S. government securities . 
Indeed , demand was so brisk at one point yesterday that , for an investor , the effective yield on a three-month Treasury bill was driven below zero , once the broker 's fee was figured in . 
This is what a Category 4 financial crisis looks like . 
Giant blue-chip financial institutions swept away in a matter of days . 
Banks refusing to lend to other banks . 
Russia closing its stock market to stop the panicked selling . 
Gold soaring $ 70 in a single trading session . 
Developing countries ' currencies in a free fall . 
Money-market funds warning they might not be able to return every dollar invested . 
Daily swings of three , four , five hundred points in the Dow Jones industrial average . 
What we are witnessing may be the greatest destruction of financial wealth that the world has ever seen -- paper losses measured in the trillions of dollars . 
It 's a painful reminder that , when you strip away all the complexity and trappings from the magnificent new global infrastructure , finance is still a confidence game -- and once the confidence goes , there 's no telling when the selling will stop . 
But more than psychology is involved here . 
What is really going on , at the most fundamental level , is that the United States is in the process of being forced by its foreign creditors to begin living within its means . 
That was n't always the case . 
In fact , for most of the past decade , foreigners seemed only too willing to provide U.S. households , corporations and governments all the cheap money they wanted -- and Americans were only too happy to take them up on their offer . 
The cheap money was used by households to buy houses , cars and college educations , along with more health care , extra vacations and all manner of consumer goods . 
Governments used the cheap money to pay for services and benefits that citizens were not willing to pay for with higher taxes . 
And corporations and investment vehicles -- hedge funds , private-equity funds and real estate investment trusts -- used the cheap financing to buy real estate and other companies . 
Two important things happened as a result of the availability of all this cheap credit . 
The first was that the price of residential and commercial real estate , corporate takeover targets and the stock of technology companies began to rise . 
The faster they rose , the more that investors were interested in buying , driving the prices even higher and creating even stronger demand . 
Before long , these markets could best be characterized as classic bubbles . 
At the same time , many companies in many industries expanded operations to accommodate the increased demand from households that decided that they could save less and spend more . 
Airlines added planes and pilots . 
Retail chains expanded into new malls and markets . 
Auto companies increased production . 
Developers built more homes and shopping centers . 
Suddenly , in early 2007 , something important happened : Foreigners began to lose their appetite for financing much of this activity -- in particular , the non-government bonds used to finance subprime mortgages , auto loans , college loans and loans used to finance big corporate takeovers . 
What should have happened at that point was that the interest rate on those loans should have increased , demand for that kind of borrowing should have decreased , the price of real estate and corporate stocks should have leveled off , takeover activity should have slowed and companies should have begun to cut back on expansion . 
Mostly , however , that did n't happen . 
Instead , the Wall Street banks that originally made these loans before selling them off in pieces decided to try to keep the good times rolling -- and , significantly , keep the lucrative underwriting fees pouring in . 
Some used their own `` AAA '' credit ratings to borrow more money and keep the loans on their own balance sheets or those of `` structured investment vehicles '' they created to hide these new liabilities from regulators and investors . 
Others went back to the foreigners and offered to insure those now-unwanted takeover loans and asset-backed securities against credit losses , through the miracle of a new kind of derivative contract known as the credit-default swap . 
As a result , when the inevitable crash finally came , it was n't only those unsuspecting foreigners who bought those leveraged loans and asset-backed securities who wound up taking the hit . 
It was also their creators -- Bear Stearns , Merrill Lynch , Citigroup , Lehman Brothers , AIG and others -- who made the mistake of doubling-down on their credit risk at the very moment they should have been cutting back . 
We are now nearing the end of the rocky process of uncovering the full extent of the credit losses of the major Wall Street banks and hedge funds . 
But as Robert Dugger , an economist and partner in a leading hedge fund likes to points out , the markets have only just begun to force some financial discipline on the majority of U.S. households that relied on borrowed money to maintain their lifestyles . 
With nobody willing to finance those lifestyles , there are really only two choices . 
One is to turn to Uncle Sam to keep the economy and the financial system afloat . 
Unlike businesses , households and Wall Street firms , the Treasury can still borrow from foreign banks and investors at incredibly attractive rates . 
And by acting as an intermediary , the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have shown a newfound willingness to use those funds to keep the housing market and the financial system from totally collapsing . 
Last spring , the government borrowed $ 165 billion to send tax rebates to households in an effort to boost consumer spending . 
Now , some Democrats want to create a new agency that would use money borrowed by the Treasury to recapitalize troubled financial institutions by buying some of their unwanted loans and securities at discounted prices . 
The same strategy was used successfully during the Great Depression and the savings and loan crisis of the 1990s , and even some Republicans are warming to the idea . 
In the end , however , there is only so much the government can borrow and so much the government can do . 
The only other choice is for Americans to finally put their spending in line with their incomes and their need for long-term savings . 
For any one household , that sounds like a good idea . 
But if everyone cuts back at roughly the same time , a recession is almost inevitable . 
That 's a bitter pill in and of itself , involving lost jobs , lower incomes and a big hit to government tax revenues . 
But it could be serious trouble for regional and local banks that have balance sheets loaded with loans to local developers and builders who will be hard hit by an economic downturn . 
Think of that , says Dugger , as the inevitable second round of this financial crisis that , alas , still lies ahead . ''

"Lawmakers Left On the Sidelines As Fed , Treasury Take Swift Action The frenetic pace of the financial crisis has forced the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to make rapid-fire decisions in recent days , leaving Capitol Hill lawmakers effectively impotent -- and frustrated . 
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed concern yesterday that they have had no control over when and how federal money has been used to curb the panic on Wall Street . 
While many have been convinced that the moves so far have been necessary to prevent a wider financial meltdown , they said they felt confined to the sidelines as power to make momentous decisions has been concentrated in very few hands . 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- 
said she has dispatched Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , to determine whether Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke should retain authority to unilaterally bail out failing firms , as he did Tuesday with a loan of $ 85 billion to insurance giant American International Group . 
Congressional leaders learned of the rescue late Tuesday during a hastily called meeting in the Capitol with Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , who explained the deal after it was done . 
`` My instincts and my gut tell me they made the wrong move . 
But I do n't have all the information they do , '' said Rep. Paul D. Ryan -LRB- R-Wis . -RRB- 
, the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee , who yesterday fielded furious calls from constituents . 
`` People are angry because they see this as their tax dollars bailing out Wall Street speculators . 
And in some cases , it is . '' 
Paulson and Bernanke have taken the lead not only from lawmakers but from President Bush . 
Bush has left direct management of the crisis to them and other advisers , and has limited his public remarks on the economy . 
On Tuesday , he canceled plans to brief reporters after meeting with his economic advisers . 
Yesterday , asked by reporters why Bush had not addressed the issue of the economy more directly in the midst of a crisis , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Bush was wary of holding news conferences in general because he did n't want to distract from the presidential campaign . 
`` I grant you that it 's been a while , '' she said , `` and I understand that people want to hear from the president during this time . '' 
Last night , the White House said Bush called off a scheduled trip to Alabama and Florida today to meet with his economic team . 
Republicans in the House have scheduled a news conference for today to protest the string of bailouts that began in March with Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns and extended in recent weeks to mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , as well as AIG . 
The latest decision was particularly hard to swallow , some lawmakers said , because it came just one day after Paulson refused to intervene to save Lehman Brothers Holdings and indicated that further rescues were unlikely . 
`` Just how long can the poor beleaguered taxpayer be expected to bear all the losses and bear all the risk ? '' 
said Rep. Jeb Hensarling -LRB- R-Tex . -RRB- 
, one of the protest 's organizers . 
`` Lehman Brothers must have the worst lobbyist in town , since they are the only ones that appear to have lost out on the bailout mania . '' 
Republicans and Democrats alike said the crisis is in part the result of insufficient government regulation on Wall Street . 
Frank and Rep. Henry A. Waxman -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- 
, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , both plan hearings aimed at exposing regulatory failures and developing a new system for managing the bad assets of financial institutions collapsing under the burden of their investments in a plummeting housing market . 
With Congress scheduled to adjourn next week , no one expects quick action , and there 's a good reason for that , said Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid -LRB- D-Nev . -RRB- . 
"
"Regarding the Sept. 17 front-page article on the government bailout of American International Group -LRB- AIG -RRB- , which was published a day after the op-ed column `` No More Creampuffs , '' about the government being willing to let large firms fail : It seems to me that the market is not really free if oil companies get huge tax breaks and financial institutions such as Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG know that the federal government will bail them out when they make stupid decisions . 
When the tenor of the federal government is to support and protect big business at the expense of efficiency , the environment , ordinary citizens and international relations , the `` free market '' is not operating as it should . 
Why are all the economic geniuses shocked at the collapse of Lehman Brothers -LRB- front page , Sept. 15 -RRB- ? 
Why should anyone be surprised at bank failures , given the banks ' investments in subprime mortgages over the past several years ? 
Their encouragement of rising housing prices made inflated values seem legitimate . 
Anyone with a brain knew that homes could n't be worth what the real estate agents and the mortgage lenders said they were worth . 
We just liked pretending that we were all millionaires because some assessment said so . 
So why do the financial pundits seem surprised ? 
Is it their fear about the economy or the realization that they 're no smarter than the rest of us ?

"
"In Crucible of Crisis , Paulson , Bernanke , Geithner Forge a Committee of Three The response to the gravest financial crisis in generations has been engineered to a remarkable degree by a committee of three . 
From the rescue of Bear Stearns to the takeovers of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and American International Group , all the key decisions have been made by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Timothy F. Geithner , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . 
It is this unusual collaboration among a consummate dealmaker , a professor and a seasoned public servant that could determine how the nation weathers the most profound threat to its economy in modern times . 
Despite their disparate backgrounds , the three men have formed a close , informal partnership built on rapid-fire phone calls and open debate that breaks the mold of Washington policymaking . 
As they chart a government response to the crisis , the stakes could hardly be higher . 
If they succeed , they could tame the economic downturn and orchestrate a restructuring of Wall Street with minimal collateral damage . 
If they fail , the toll could be millions of jobs , trillions of dollars in lost wealth and a crisis of confidence in global capitalism . 
Paulson , Bernanke and Geithner spent most of their careers in different worlds . 
They barely knew one another before beginning their current jobs and still rarely socialize -- though they have spent more time working together in recent months than with their wives . 
Paulson , 62 , is an investment banker who rose through the ranks of Goldman Sachs to lead the firm . 
A lanky former Dartmouth College offensive tackle and an intense workaholic , he said he agreed in 2006 to become the Bush administration 's third Treasury secretary to prepare the government for a possible market crisis . 
Bernanke , 54 and calm of demeanor , is one of the foremost scholars of financial crises , especially the Great Depression . 
Before being named Fed chairman in 2006 , the largest organization he had run was Princeton University 's economics department . 
Geithner , 47 , was a career staff member at the Treasury Department when Lawrence Summers , then a Treasury undersecretary , plucked him from obscurity in the early 1990s . 
He became a key member of the group that guided the Clinton administration 's response to the international financial crises in the 1990s and has been honing his knowledge of Wall Street since taking over the New York Fed in 2003 . 
`` The biggest thing is we are not competing with each other , we are working together , '' Paulson said in an interview . 
`` I would say they have done so much to help me , and I would do anything to help them . '' 
Their teamwork , which began when Paulson came to Washington , has had a far-reaching and controversial effect on the financial world . 
Critics say they have been inconsistent in their reactions to market events -- they allowed Lehman Brothers to collapse over the weekend but bailed out AIG on Tuesday -- leaving the markets uncertain about what the government would do for other firms on the brink . 
Those who praise the men say the rescues go only to firms whose demise would cause broad distress , not any firm that comes begging . 
The men 's close partnership has also drawn the normally independent Fed into collaboration with political authorities while exposing taxpayers to tens of billions of dollars , critics say . 
And some lawmakers say the concentration of power into the hands of these men is too great . 
Yet by virtue of the division of labor among them , they are able to cobble together government responses that might otherwise be elusive . 
"
"Well , thanks for your patience , everybody . 
We are , as everybody knows , facing one of the most serious financial crises in this nation 's history . 
The events of last week , from the failure of Lehman to the bailout of AIG to the continuing volatility in the market , have not just threatened trading floors and high-rises of Wall Street , but the stability and security of our entire global economy . 
Across this country Americans are worried about whether they can make their mortgage payments or keep their jobs or ensure that their retirement is secure . 
So truly we 're all in this together . 
Our government and the Federal Reserve have already taken unprecedented action to prevent a deepening of this crisis that could jeopardize the life savings and well-beings of millions of Americans . 
But it 's now clear that even bolder and more decisive action is necessary . 
In recent years I 've outlined plans that would have helped prevent the problems that we face , and yesterday I proposed the outlines of a plan that would establish a more stable and permanent solution to strengthen our financial system . 
Today , I fully support the efforts of Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke to work in a bipartisan spirit with Congress to find a solution of this sort . 
What we 're looking at right now is to provide the Treasury and the Federal Reserve with as broad authority as is necessary to stabilize markets and to maintain credit . 
We also need a more institutional response to create a system that can manage some of the underlying problems with bad mortgages , help homeowners stay in their homes , protect the retirement and savings of working Americans . 
In the coming days , I 'll work closely to examine the details of the Treasury and the Fed proposal , and , as I do , I 'll work to ensure that it provides an effective emergency response by including four basic principles that my economic advisers and I just discussed this morning . 
First , we can not only have a plan for Wall Street . 
We must also help Main Street . 
I 'm glad that our government 's moving so quickly in addressing the crisis that threatens some of our biggest banks and corporations , but a similar crisis has threatened families , workers and homeowners for months and months , and Washington has done far too little to help . 
For too long this administration 's been willing to hit the fast - forward button in helping distressed Wall Street firms while pressing pause when it comes to saving jobs and keeping people in their homes . 
OBAMA : We already know that the credit crisis that 's emerged from our largest financial institutions is becoming a credit crunch for small-business owners , homeowners and students seeking loans in big cities and small towns across the country . 
And now that American taxpayers are being called on to share this new burden , we must take equally swift and serious action to help lift the burdens they face every day . 
In the same bipartisan spirit that 's been shown with regard to the crisis on Wall Street , I urge Senator McCain , President Bush , Republicans and Democrats to join me in supporting an emergency economic plan for working families , a plan that would help folks cope with rising gas and food prices , spark job creation through repair of our schools and our roads , help states and cities avoid painful budget cuts and tax increases , help homeowners stay in their homes , and provide retooling assistance for America 's auto industry . 
John McCain and I can continue to argue about our different economic agendas for next year , but we should come together now to work on what this country urgently needs this year . 
The second principle I 'd like to see in the emerging plan from the Treasury and the Fed is that our approach should be one of mutual responsibility and reciprocity . 
It must be designed -- it must not be designed to reward particular companies or the irresponsible decisions of borrowers or lenders . 
It must not be designed to enhance the personal gain of CEOs and management . 
The recklessness of some of these executives has helped to cause this mess , even as they walked away with million-dollar -- multi - million-dollar golden parachutes while taxpayers are left holding the bag . 
As taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary steps to protect our financial system , it 's only appropriate that those who benefit are expected to contribute to the protection of American homeowners and the American economy . 
Just as support is not designed to pay off egregious executive compensation , it should not reward those who are ruthlessly foreclosing on American families . 
OBAMA : Third , this plan must be temporary and coupled with tough new oversight and regulations on our financial institutions , and there must be a clear process to wind down this plan and restore private sector assets into private sector hands after restoring stability to the system . 
Taxpayers must share in any upside benefit that such stability brings . 
Fourth , this plan should be part of a globally coordinated effort with our partners in the G-20 . 
This is a worldwide issue , and while the United States can and will lead in stabilizing the credit markets , we should ask that other nations who share in this crisis be part of the solution as well . 
We did not arrive at this crisis by some accident in history . 
What led us to this point was years and years of a philosophy in Washington and on Wall Street that viewed even common-sense regulation and oversight as unwise and unnecessary , that shredded consumer protections and loosened the rules of the road . 
CEOs and executives got reckless , lobbyists got what they wanted , and politicians in both parties looked the other way until it was too late . 
It is now the American people who 've paid the price . 
The events of this week I believe have rendered a final verdict on that failed philosophy and it will end if I am president of the United States . 
We have to build upon the ideas I 've laid out over the last several years about how to modernize our financial regulatory system in this country and that establishes common-sense rules of the road for our financial system to help restore confidence throughout the financial system . 
Finally , given the gravity of this situation and based on conversations I 've had with both Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke , I will refrain from presenting a more detailed blueprint about how an immediate plan might be structured until I can fully review the details of the plan proposed by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve . 
I think it 's critical at this point that the markets and the public have confidence that their work will be unimpeded by partisan wrangling and that leaders in both parties work in concert to solve the problem at hand . 
I know these are difficult days , and I know there are a lot of families out there that are feeling anxiety about their jobs , about their homes and about their retirement savings . 
But here is what I also know : This is not a time for fear , it 's not a time for panic . 
It 's a time for resolve and a time for leadership . 
OBAMA : I know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because we have done it before . 
That 's what we do as Americans . 
Our nation has faced even more difficult times . 
And each moment , when we have , we 've risen to meet the challenges as one people and one nation . 
I 'm confident that we will be doing the same in this circumstance . 
And with that I 'll take three or four questions . 
QUESTION : Senator , you 've talked repeatedly today about the recklessness of CEOs and so forth . 
But by all these bailouts , these hundreds of billions of dollars -- I mean , are n't we still sending a message to future , you know , gamblers that , `` Look , whatever you do , we 're going to be there to back you up anyway , so ... '' OBAMA : No. . 
If we structure it properly , then the answer is no. . 
Here 's how I would describe the situation . 
We have a immediate emergency situation in the capital markets . 
And it is important to provide the Treasury and the Fed broad authority to make sure that the credit markets work , that bills are paid , payrolls are made , that there 's liquidity in the system . 
We have , then , an institutional problem that has to do with a regulatory system that 's inadequate to the new global marketplace . 
We set up after the Great Depression things like FDI insurance to prevent bank runs . 
We put in place capital requirements . 
We made sure that banks had to operate in a prudent way in order to qualify for FDI insurance -- FDIC insurance . 
And that part of it worked , except that part of it is just a fraction now of our overall capital flows . 
So we 're going to have to update for the 21st century the same kinds of regulations that we put in place for the 20th century . 
And if we do that effectively , then we can prevent a situation where folks can take enormous risks knowing that , heads I win and tails , you lose . 
That is going to -- we 're going to have to take some critical steps . 
And I think the next administration has to be committed to upgrading those financial regulations . 
But right now what we have to do is make sure that the capital markets are working so that people , small businesses , folks who are waking up in the morning , know that their money market funds are protected , they know they can make payroll , and that as much as possible we are able to ensure that on Main Street some of the pain is limited . 
OBAMA : And I think what has to be clear is , is that whatever is set up is not bailing out shareholders and CEOs . 
They need to take their losses because they were enjoying the upside when the times were good . 
You 've said on the campaign trail you 're tough enough . 
And it looks like there 's going to have to be a tough interaction with the administration over whether there 's going to be a stimulus bill added to this overall package . 
I 'm told that Pelosi and Reid last night pressed Secretary Paulson . 
How tough are you prepared to be to as the Democratic nominee to see the stimulus plan is in this final legislative package ? 
Two , Paulson said this morning hundreds of billions of dollars are going to be required to put this together . 
With that as a reality , can you looking forward still promise the tax cuts to the middle class you 've talked about ? 
And , with capital such a crucial issue right , do the taxes on dividends and other high-end taxes make sense ? 
There is a relationship between economic stimulus that I think needs to take place right now and long-term tax cuts for the middle class . 
One of my central beliefs about our economy has been that -- a theory that gives more to the most thinking that it 's going to trickle down on everybody else is not going to work ; that the more that we 've got broad-based prosperity and families have higher wages and incomes , the better off the economy is going to be as a whole . 
And that 's especially true at a time when we 've got recessionary tendencies . 
So I think now more than ever we 've got to have the kind of broad-based middle class tax cut that I 've talked about for 95 percent of working families . 
And effectively , the stimulus package is a downpayment on that long-term shift in our tax code . 
OBAMA : So I think it is very important that , even as we stabilized the financial system , that we understand that people have been hurting long before Wall Street was hurting , and that if people are continuing to not be able to pay their bills at the end of the month , if they have n't seen wage increases when their gas and grocery prices , their health care prices , the price of sending their kids to college have all skyrocketed , that the underlying weakness in terms of consumer purchasing power , the underlying weakness in terms of people being able to make their payments on their homes , that 's going to continue to put a drag on the capital market . 
So this is -- this is a fundamental difference in philosophy that also happens I think to be the right prescription for what 's ailing the economy . 
But short term , you know , in the next several days and weeks , we 've got to make sure that Secretary Paulson and Bernanke have the broad authority they need just to make sure that capital markets are working the way they need to . 
QUESTION : You said it 's the time for leadership . 
Senator McCain is outlining a plan today . 
You say you 're waiting on a detailed blueprint . 
You have an Democratic economic braintrust surrounding you here . 
Does this suggest you 're sitting on the sidelines , that this is ... Well , first of all , you know , I took a look at what Senator McCain had offered . 
And essentially it 's about as detailed as the one paragraph that he had offered yesterday and that I had talked about yesterday and that my -- one of my chief economic advisers , Paulson , had written about several -- excuse me -- Volcker had written about just a couple days ago in the Wall Street Journal . 
I am glad to see that Senator McCain agrees with not just me but also Secretary Paulson and Bernanke that at some point we 're going to need sort of institutionalized structure to deal with the underlying problems of bad mortgages and -- and some of the bad assets that some of these markets have . 
In my conversations with Secretary Paulson , Bernanke as well as my advisers , what is absolutely clear is that you do n't put together something like that on the cuff . 
You do n't do it in a day . 
We 've got to do it in an intelligent , systematic , thoughtful fashion . 
And , you know , I 'm much less interested at this point in scoring political points than I am making sure that we have a structure in place that is sound and is actually going to work . 
Right now , though , the problem is the capital markets and making sure that we get something in place quickly to ensure that the treasury secretary and the Fed have the authority they need to get capital flowing again . 
And I think that what we do n't want to do is get too bogged down in some complicated legislative wrangling . 
OBAMA : There 's going to be a lot of time for us to be in a big argument about how some of these future plans should be structured . 
QUESTION : Senator , because we are in South Florida , does that plan involve working closer with those nations in Latin America that have not wanted to work with the United States before ? 
OBAMA : Well , as I said before , I think it 's important for us to get the G-20 involved in this conversation . 
We now have global markets . 
It 's insufficient for us to think in isolation that somehow we can cordon ourselves off or that other countries can cordon themselves off from us . 
Now , this has been true for a pretty long time . 
Some of you will recall that Bob Rubin faced some similar problems when he was treasury secretary when we had the Mexican peso crisis . 
But it 's even more true now . 
And the financial instruments that have been developed are even more complex . 
We 've got even more leverage and debt and borrowing that 's been taking place that makes the current situation that much more complex and interconnected . 
So it 's going to be very important for Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke to coordinate with their counterparts in other countries so that everybody is moving in concert and everybody is rowing in the same direction . 
QUESTION : Secretary Paulson says that it 's going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars , the bailout plan . 
Senator Shelby said perhaps even a trillion dollars . 
Do you believe that this is an appropriate amount ? 
And secondly , if you were president , would you set a limit , a cap , per se , on the kind of burden that taxpayers would have in bailing out these financial institutions ? 
OBAMA : Well , keep in mind , the -- and I do n't want to get too technical here , but what the secretary is asking for is authority to do what 's required to get the capital markets straight . 
He is not saying -- as I understand it , and we have n't yet seen the details -- that he is putting all this money at risk , whatever the amount is , and that that taxpayer money is automatically going to be expended . 
I do n't want to comment on a particular amount , partly because I have not received a specific proposal from the treasury secretary at this point . 
Here 's what I would say as president . 
As president I would say to Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke : `` Do what 's required to make sure that people 's money market accounts are protected . 
Do what 's required to make sure that small businesses have credit lines to allow them to make payroll . 
Do what 's required to make sure that the economy is running and that ordinary people are able to go about what they do every single day , which is work hard and support their families . '' 
And what we then have to do is also make sure that taxpayer money is not being used to bail out bad decisions that are made by investors , shareholders or CEOs on Wall Street . 
And those principles , I think , are compatible . 
I think that Secretary Paulson is mindful of them . 
He 's certainly heard from me that we do n't want -- we do n't want bailouts of folks who have been -- taken bad decisions . 
But what we also want to make sure of is , is that the economic system as a whole continues and that ordinary people are able to wake up on Monday and keep doing what they 've been doing . 
QUESTION : Have your advisers told you that the situation has stabilized , or should we expect more failures and more bailouts to come ? 
OBAMA : Well , here 's where I think we are . 
The markets have a lot of worry right now about what assets are good out there . 
Whether -- if they make a short-term loan to somebody they 're going to get repaid . 
And so everybody is locked up . 
Everybody 's freezed up . 
Everybody 's hesitant about making what used to be routine loans . 
And the job , then , of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve is to break through that psychology and let people know when -- you know , if you make this loan today , then tomorrow , folks are going to be able to pay it back , and to break this self-fulfilling prophecy that has gripped the market at this point . 
Because it 's not just a problem of underlying assets and values but it 's also market psychology , it 's hard to say how the market responds over the next week or two weeks or three weeks . 
But what I can say is that if the treasury secretary has the broad authority that he needs , if the Fed chairman has the broad authority that he needs , and if the president is clear to both of them of the principle that I just outlined -- make sure the capital markets are working and make sure that we are not using taxpayer dollars to bail out people who are making very bad decisions and walking away with millions of dollars -- then I believe that the market should settle down . 
I believe that the market should be able to say to itself : `` You know what ? 
We are going to be able to get through this difficult period of time '' -- understanding that we 're then going to have to still set up some institutional mechanisms to deal with some of the underlying problems of the economy . 
And that 's what I 've been talking about throughout the course of this campaign . 
The short-term weakness in the capital markets is a reflection of longer-term problems that we have in our economy . 
It has to do with the fact that wages and income have not gone up . 
It has to do with a tax code that has been skewed against folks on Main Street . 
It has to do that we have underinvested in infrastructure , underinvested in our education system . 
It has to do with the fact we have not managed our federal budget with any kind of discipline and so we have been loading up enormous amounts of debt . 
It has to do that we have spent well over half a trillion dollars , soon to be a trillion dollars , on a war in Iraq . 
Despite the fact that Iraqis are now running surpluses , we 're still spending $ 10 billion a month there . 
It has to do with the fact that we 've got a broken health care system that is enormous strain on businesses as well as families . 
And so , if we recognize that there are these longer-term structural problems that have to be dealt with , starting with the housing market , and there 's some confidence that , in fact , we 're going to change economics -LRB- sic -RRB- philosophies from what we 've seen over the last eight years to get those things right , then the key is for us now to just get through these turbulent times and for the market to say to itself , `` We can solve these bigger problems . 
Let 's make sure that we do n't compound them with -- with fear and panic right now . ''

"When newly appointed White House chief of staff Joshua B. Bolten tried to shake up the Bush administration in the spring of 2006 , he spent weeks wooing Goldman Sachs chief executive Henry M. Paulson Jr. to be Treasury secretary . 
Bolten had personal reasons for thinking Paulson might be a good pick -- Bolten himself had worked for the influential investment bank in Europe in the 1990s -- and Paulson eventually gave in to his persistent lobbying . 
`` I had always trusted him , '' Paulson once said of Bolten in an interview . 
`` I felt a bond and a sense of trust . '' 
Paulson and Bolten are just two of the onetime Goldman figures who find themselves managing perhaps the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression . 
After Paulson took over at Treasury in May 2006 , he turned to Goldman colleague Robert K. Steel to help him oversee financial markets . 
Steel left recently to run Wachovia , but several other Goldman alumni remain to help Paulson deal with the ongoing market turmoil . 
Such heavy reliance on the most prestigious Wall Street investment firm has become something of a bipartisan Washington tradition in recent years ; Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin was also a co - chairman of Goldman Sachs , as was Bush economic adviser Stephen Friedman . 
But if the Wall Street meltdown continues , the tradition may come under scrutiny , especially if Goldman eventually needs the kind of government assistance granted Bear Stearns or American International Group . 
From the right , prominent voices question Paulson 's use of taxpayer dollars to help rescue private firms , while liberal and labor groups attack the ideological orientation of the Treasury secretary and other officials hailing from Goldman . 
`` Goldman culture has prided itself on creating sort of financial statesmen who would come to Washington as well as operate in the highest realm of finance , '' said Robert Borosage , president of the Institute for America 's Future , a liberal think tank . 
`` What 's clear is that these people in both parties -- whether it 's Rubin or Paulson -- have been leading promulgators of the deregulation that has gotten us in this hole . '' 
Jeffrey E. Garten , who worked on international economic matters in several administrations , took a different view . 
`` If we are going to have a highly skilled revolving door , I do n't think you can do better than look at the top ranks of Goldman Sachs and bring them into government , '' he said . 
`` They are brutally effective . 
They waste absolutely no time . 
They are not lone rangers . 
They surround themselves with a lot of people and seek as much advice as they can , '' said Garten , who now teaches international trade and finance at Yale University . 
`` They are masters at getting at the heart of a problem in lightning speed . '' 
Asked why presidents turn to Goldman , White House spokesman Tony Fratto said it was more a question for Goldman than for the administration . 
`` It 's part of the culture up there at Goldman that they appreciate public service , '' he said . 
Fratto said Bolten , who worked on legal and government affairs at Goldman in the 1990s , has no reason to recuse himself from matters concerning the firm because he worked there years ago and has no continuing financial interest . 
Paulson has recused himself from issues directly affecting Goldman , though he can seek a waiver if the White House counsel and Office of Government Ethics deem it appropriate , Fratto said . 
The r sum s of Bolten and Paulson illustrate the revolving door between Washington and Goldman Sachs . 
Both went to Goldman after working in government -- Bolten as counsel to the U.S. trade representative during the George H.W. Bush administration and Paulson at the White House and Pentagon in the Nixon administration -- before returning to federal service at a very senior level . 
Other Bush administration officials have followed similar paths . 
After he resigned as deputy secretary of state in 2006 , Robert B. Zoellick worked briefly at Goldman Sachs before being named by Bush as president of the World Bank . 
Dina Habib Powell , former White House personnel chief and assistant secretary of state , now oversees Goldman 's charitable and philanthropic activities . 
Democrats have turned to Goldman alumni including Rubin and Gary Gensler , a Goldman partner who served in top positions in the Clinton Treasury Department . 
Another former chief executive , Jon S. Corzine , went on to serve in the Senate and is now the Democratic governor of New Jersey . 
Political contributions suggest a Democratic tilt at Goldman ; of the $ 4.3 million so far contributed to campaigns this year by employees or by the firm 's political action committee , roughly three-quarters has gone to Democrats , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . 
The contributions suggest how attuned the firm is to Washington , where actions on regulation and other policies can affect the bottom line . 
Said one former Treasury official : `` They see long-term strategic advantage in being involved in the intersection of public policy and finance , not just here but also Brussels and other capitals . ''

"I thank the treasury secretary , Hank Paulson , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and SEC Chairman Chris Cox for joining me today . 
This is a pivotal moment for America 's economy . 
Problems that originated in the credit markets and first showed up in the area of subprime mortgages have spread throughout our financial system . 
This has led to an erosion of confidence that has frozen many financial transactions including loans to consumers and to businesses seeking to expand and create jobs . 
As a result we must act now to protect our nation 's economic health from serious risk . 
There will be ample opportunity to debate the origins of this problem . 
Now is the time to solve it . 
In our nation 's history there have been moments that require us to come together across party lines to address major challenges . 
This is such a moment . 
Last night , Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke and Chairman Cox met with congressional leaders of both parties and they had a very good meeting . 
I appreciate the willingness of congressional leaders to confront this situation head-on . 
Our system of free enterprise rests on the conviction that the federal government should interfere in the marketplace only when necessary . 
Given the precarious state of today 's financial markets , and their vital importance to the daily lives of the American people , government intervention is not only warranted , it is essential . 
In recent weeks , the federal government has taken a series of measures to help promote stability in the overall economy . 
To avoid severe disruptions in the financial markets and support home financing , we took action to address the situation in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
The Federal Reserve also acted to prevent the disorderly liquidation of the insurance company AIG . 
BUSH : And in coordination with central banks around the world , the Fed has injected much-needed liquidity into our financial system . 
These were targeted measures designed primarily to stop the problems of individual firms from spreading even more broadly . 
But more action is needed . 
We must address the root cause behind much of the instability in our markets : mortgage assets that have lost value during the housing decline and are now restricting the flow of credit . 
America 's economy is facing unprecedented challenges , and we are responding with unprecedented action . 
Secretary Paulson , Chairman Bernanke and Chairman Cox have briefed leaders on Capitol Hill on the urgent need for Congress to pass legislation approving the federal government 's purchase of illiquid assets , such as troubled mortgages , from banks and other financial institutions . 
This is a decisive step that will address underlying problems in our financial system . 
It will help take pressure off the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions . 
It will allow them to resume lending and get our financial system moving again . 
Additionally the federal government is taking several other steps to address the trouble of our financial markets . 
The Department of Treasury is acting to restore confidence in a key element of America 's financial system : money market mutual funds . 
In the past , government insurance was not available for these funds , and the recent stresses on the markets have caused some to question whether these investments are safe and accessible . 
The Treasury Department 's actions address that concern by offering government insurance for money market mutual funds . 
For every dollar invested in an insured fund , you 'll be able to a dollar out . 
BUSH : The Federal Reserve is also taking steps to provide additional liquidity to money market mutual funds , which will help ease pressure on our financial markets . 
These measures will act as grease for the gears of our financial system , which were at risk of grinding to a halt . 
They will support the flow of credit to households and businesses . 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued new rules temporarily suspending the practice of short selling on the stocks of financial institutions . 
This is intended to prevent investors from intentionally driving down particular stocks for their own personal gain . 
The SEC is also requiring certain investors to disclose their short selling and has launched rigorous enforcement actions to detect fraud and manipulation in the market . 
Anyone engaging in illegal financial transactions will be caught and persecuted -LRB- sic -RRB- . 
Finally , when we get past the immediate challenges , my administration looks forward to working with Congress on measures to bring greater long-term transparency and reliability to the financial system , including those in the regulatory blueprint submitted by Secretary Paulson earlier this year . 
BUSH : Many of the regulations governing the functioning of America 's markets were written in a different era . 
It is vital that we update them to meet the realities of today 's global financial system . 
The actions I just outlined reflect the considered judgment of Secretary Paulson , Chairman Bernanke and Chairman Cox . 
We believe that this decisive government action is needed to preserve America 's financial system and sustain America 's overall economy . 
These measures will require us to put a significant amount of taxpayer dollars on the line . 
This action does entail risk , but we expect that this money will eventually be paid back . 
The vast majority of assets the government is planning to purchase have good value over time because the vast majority of homeowners continue to pay their mortgages . 
The risk is -- of not acting would be far higher . 
Further stress on our financial markets would cause massive job losses , devastate retirement accounts and further erode housing values , as well as dry up loans for new homes and cars and college tuitions . 
These are risks that America can not afford to take . 
In this difficult time , I know many Americans are wondering about the security of their finances . 
Every American should know that the federal government continues to enforce laws and regulations protecting your money . 
Through the FDIC every savings account , checking account and certificate of deposit is insured by the federal government for up to $ 100,000 . 
The FDIC has been in existence for 75 years , and no one has ever lost a penny on an insured deposit , and this will not change . 
BUSH : America 's financial system is intricate and complex , but behind all the technical terminology and statistics is a critical human factor : confidence . 
Confidence in our financial system and in its institutions is essential to the smooth operation of our economy , and recently that confidence has been shaken . 
Investors should know that the United States government is taking action to restore confidence in America 's financial markets so they can thrive again . 
In the long run Americans have good reason to be confident in our economic strength . 
America has the most talented , productive and entrepreneurial workers in the world . 
This country is the best place in the world to invest and do business . 
Consumers around the world continue to seek out American products , as evidenced by record high exports . 
We have a flexible and resilient system that absorbs challenges and makes corrections and bounces back . 
We 've seen that resilience over the past eight years . 
Since 2001 our economy has faced a recession , the bursting of the dot-com bubble , major corporate scandals , an unprecedented attack on our homeland , a global war on terror , a series of devastating natural disasters . 
Our economy has weathered every one of these challenges and still managed to grow . 
We will weather this challenge , too , and we must do so together . 
This is no time for partisanship . 
We must join to move urgently needed legislation as quickly as possible without adding controversial provisions that could delay action . 
I 'll work with Democrats and Republicans alike to steer our economy through these difficult times and get back to the path of long-term growth .

"Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has adapted the Treasury 's traditional powers to deal with the financial crisis . 
-LRB- Chip Somodevilla - Getty Images -RRB- The degree of government intervention into the workings of the private marketplace is unprecedented . 
Three giant financial institutions taken over . 
Government purchases of vast quantities of hard-to-sell assets from banks , investment banks and anyone else whose demise might threaten the financial system . 
Trading outlawed in an entire class of securities . 
A government guarantee extended to a whole new category of investments . 
Laws have been stretched until they are barely recognizable -- like the one , from the days of the gold standard , that authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to buy and sell the precious metal , now used to authorize a wholly new insurance program for money-market funds . 
Roles have been expanded well beyond anything that could have been imagined only weeks ago , like the central bank taking control of a giant insurance company . 
And tossed aside have been long-standing conventions , such as the quaint ideal that independent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve should keep a proper distance from the White House and the executive branch . 
The amount of taxpayer money committed , or about to be committed , to this rescue effort is simply staggering -- easily a trillion dollars , when all the loans , purchases and guarantees are added up . 
Although most if not all of that is likely to be returned to the Treasury , it still represents a massive shift of liability to the balance sheet of the U.S. government . 
All that to save free-market capitalism from its own excesses . 
It should tell you something about the critical condition of the financial system that both free-market zealots of the right and angry populists of the left are willing to put aside their ideology and commit themselves to speedy passage of legislation whose details they have yet to see , but the mere prospect of which drove the Dow Jones industrial average up 700 points over two days . 
Emerging from meeting Thursday night at the Capitol with top officials of the Treasury , the Fed and the SEC , congressional leaders looked like deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming eighteen-wheeler . 
It is an exaggeration and a journalistic cliche to say that after the events of the past two weeks , the U.S. economy will never be the same . 
Despite the record volume and volatility on financial markets , stock prices and benchmark interest rates have pretty much returned to where they were . 
And in most households , and most companies outside of Wall Street , life goes on pretty much as usual . 
Moreover , officials have taken pains to emphasize that most of the recent initiatives are temporary . 
But in terms of the political economy , there is little doubt we are witnessing a once-in-a-generation sea change . 
It will no longer be an easy applause line for a politician to declare that government is the problem and that markets always know better than regulators and politicians . 
With Bear Stearns and AIG as their rallying cry , citizens will demand the same kind of financial security and protection as bondholders of big banks and counter-parties of hedge funds . 
Debates about the competitiveness of U.S. financial markets will focus less on how little regulated they are and more on how much protection and transparency they offer to investors . 
It will be harder to deny essential government agencies the talent , money and respect they need to do the job right . 
An interesting comparison can be made between Hurricane Katrina and the current financial crisis , which symbolically has now stranded a number of rich investors on the roofs of their mansions , crying out to the government to be rescued .

"Five Days That Transformed Wall Street : Sept. 15 - 19 , 2008 The Dow Jones industrial average , which jumped between massive losses and gains , closed Friday , Sept. 19 up 3.4 percent after the Bush administration proposed an unprecedented $ 500 billion bailout for financial firms in direct response to the mortgage crisis . 
How the week unfolded : SOURCE : Bloomberg | GRAPHIC : By Brenna Maloney and Todd Lindeman , The Washington Post ; Photo by Mary Altaffer , Associated Press - September 20 , 2008 
"
"This article misstated the first name of James B. Lockhart III , the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency . 
Historic Market Bailout Set in Motion The Bush administration yesterday proposed a historic $ 500 billion bailout of financial firms that would let the government rather than the cold judgment of the marketplace decide the winners and losers from the crisis that has shaken the U.S. economy for the past year . 
Millions of Americans could also benefit from other dramatic stopgap measures . 
Regulators announced efforts to stabilize the mortgage market ; curb stock speculation ; and insure money-market mutual funds with government money , seeking to protect ordinary investors and preserve a vital source of corporate finance . 
The initiatives were precipitated in part by concern that scared investors would race to withdraw their holdings from money-market funds , which hold $ 3.5 trillion in investments , depleting a major source of short-term funding for corporations . 
President Bush , who had remained largely silent as the crisis broadened this week , said it is a `` pivotal moment for America 's economy . '' 
In a Rose Garden speech remarkable for its grim language and ominous tone , Bush said : `` This action does entail risk . 
But we expect that this money will eventually be paid back ... The risk of not acting would be far higher . '' 
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. acknowledged that the federal government 's previous policy of addressing corporate failures on a case-by-case basis had not stemmed the accelerating crisis . 
He said the new comprehensive strategy has a better chance of calming the turmoil that froze critical segments of the credit markets and sent stock markets into a tailspin earlier this week . 
`` I am convinced that this bold approach will cost American families far less than the alternative -- a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets , '' Paulson said in a speech at the Treasury Department . 
The Bush administration , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and congressional allies launched a major offensive yesterday to persuade lawmakers to support Paulson 's proposal . 
Because the plan needs the approval of Congress , officials from the Treasury and the Fed are worried that delay by lawmakers would spark fresh anxiety in the markets . 
They are working with congressional leaders to pass the plan by the end of next week , which would be extraordinarily quick for Capitol Hill . 
`` I am very optimistic that we can pass a balanced and comprehensive plan within a week , '' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- , who chairs the Joint Economic Committee . 
`` Chairman Bernanke made all too clear the cost of inaction . '' 
Some lawmakers , including Sen. Richard C. Shelby -LRB- Ala. -RRB- , the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , have expressed concerns about the plan 's cost , chance of success and possible unintended consequences . 
Such opposition could delay passage . 
`` We are being asked to go ` all in ' with taxpayer dollars , and once our government and the taxpayer is on the hook , there is no fallback option , '' said Rep. Jeb Hensarling -LRB- R-Tex . -RRB- 
, a leading conservative . 
`` At the moment I remain skeptical , fearful and unconvinced that this is the proper remedy for our nation . '' 
Paulson and Bernanke held a morning conference call with more than 100 House Republicans , making the case for their plan and describing in `` strong and serious '' terms the dire situation facing the financial system , according to a participant on the call . 
Hours later , the House Republican leadership met with members and lobbyists to warn against cluttering the legislation with amendments or trying to delay its passage . 
The message , according to a person at the meeting : We want a clean bill . 
"
"Looking for someone to blame for the shambles in U.S. financial markets ? 
As someone who owns both an investment bank and commercial banks , and also runs a hedge fund , I have sat front and center and watched as this mess unfolded . 
And in my view , there 's no need to look beyond Wall Street -- and the halls of power in Washington . 
The former has created the nightmare by chasing obscene profits , and the latter have allowed it to spread by not practicing the oversight that is the federal government 's responsibility . 
I find it hard to stomach the fact that investment banks that caused this financial crisis immediately ran to the government asking for assistance , which Bear Stearns received and Lehman Brothers , thankfully , did not . 
This is one of many eerie parallels that the current meltdown bears to the Great Depression , when Washington and the taxpayers had to step up and take unprecedented action to stabilize the financial markets and the economy . 
Unfortunately , the government today has already put enormous taxpayer resources at risk -- bailing out investment firm Bear Stearns , mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and insurer AIG , and proposing to buy risky assets from the banking system -- to stop the economy from plummeting into another depression . 
But these events only underscore the toxic relationship between Washington and Wall Street that has brought us to this point . 
To understand the role of that relationship in our current troubles , let 's go back to 1999 . 
That was when the hype about the Internet reached its pinnacle . 
Technology spending by the government and corporations was booming as both sought to address economic and security fears surrounding the so-called Y2K problem , a potential massive computer shutdown at the start of the year 2000 . 
In the run-up to the millennium , the Federal Reserve , led by then-Chairman Alan Greenspan , began to pump money into the capital markets to deal with any financial problems that might arise from a Y2K meltdown . 
In the end , 2000 arrived to nothing but a wonderful celebration . 
But the monetary stimulus , coupled with the aforementioned hype , created an unfortunate bubble in Internet , technology and telecommunications stocks . 
At the center of this bubble were the large Wall Street investment banks , which understood the profit potential in promoting the technology boom to overeager clients looking for the investment of a lifetime . 
From mid-1999 to mid-2000 , Wall Street firms took approximately 500 companies public , raising a total of nearly $ 77 billion for these companies through initial public offerings , or IPOs . 
For every IPO , the investment banks themselves earned an underwriting fee of 6 percent , returning them an enormous profit . 
But apparently that was not enough for Wall Street . 
As the middlemen between the insatiable investor demand for anything technology-related and young tech entrepreneurs needing to raise capital , the investment banks demanded the opportunity to invest in these companies before the public offerings , when the companies 's stocks were valued at a fraction of what they would bring post-IPO . 
It was n't uncommon for Wall Street firms to invest tens of millions of dollars in `` anything.com '' before taking it public , charge a multimillion-dollar fee for the public offering and then watch their investment multiply within a matter of months . 
Main Street investors , meanwhile , did not realize that the investment banks had essentially thrown away their underwriting guidelines , which had been in place since the Depression , to take companies public . 
Among these guidelines were rules requiring that a company be in business for more than five years , be profitable for two or three consecutive years and have certain levels of revenue and profitability . 
The business models of many of the companies that went public simply were n't viable . 
Once the Internet bubble burst and the dust settled , America 's corporate landscape was littered with bankruptcies and mass layoffs , and investor losses have been estimated at more than $ 1 trillion . 
In an effort to offset the economic strain from these losses , the Fed once again rapidly increased the money supply and slashed short-term interest rates to 1 percent -- a level that had n't been seen in more than 45 years . 
This enormous monetary stimulus -LRB- along with significant federal spending -RRB- energized the overall economy , but it also led to the greatest housing boom -- and possible bust -- this country has ever encountered . 
From 2002 to 2006 , housing values appreciated at an astounding rate of 16 percent per year . 
It became impossible for the typical American family to buy an average-priced house using a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage . 
Wall Street found another perfect opportunity to propel and take advantage of another forming bubble . 
The result was the explosion of toxic new mortgage products that enticed homebuyers into supporting escalating housing prices while eliminating the need for the traditional 20 percent down payment . 
Whether it was interest-only loans , low - or no-doc `` liar loans , '' or piggyback home-equity loans , the mortgage and banking industries found a way to place almost anyone with -- or even without -- a credit score into a home . 
Wall Street played its part by packaging those mortgages into complex financial products and selling them to other investors , many of whom had no idea of what they were buying or the associated risks . 
Once again , the investment banks raked in billions of dollars in fees , giving them incentive to keep lowering underwriting standards , allowing mortgage companies to originate and sell even the most unscrupulous home loans , which Wall Street then dumped onto the investment community . 
Wall Street never once questioned the ethics of these activities ; it too was focused on the enormous rewards that allowed its firms to pay out an unfathomable $ 62 billion in bonuses in 2006 alone . 
Without Wall Street , the housing bubble would have ended shortly after the Fed started to raise interest rates in 2004 , because no lenders would have originated these toxic mortgages if they had to keep the loans on their own balance sheets . 
The price of all this greed ? 
Sadly , because of the actions of the investment banks , the mortgage industry and the rating agencies , the investment community has now incurred an estimated $ 1 trillion and more in losses . 
Even more troubling , housing prices have dropped 20 percent from their July 2006 highs , with the very real likelihood that housing could contract another 15 to 20 percent -- essentially wiping out more than $ 4 trillion in housing values . 
This would be the biggest hit since the Depression to Americans ' most important asset . 
What is even more remarkable is that at the same time , firms such as Goldman Sachs and Lehman not only made billions of dollars packaging and selling these toxic loans , they also wagered with their own capital that the values of these investments would decline , further raising their profits . 
If any other industries engaged in such knowingly unscrupulous activities , there would be an immediate federal investigation . 
Why is Washington so complicit in this intricate and lucrative affair ? 
First , the Fed laid the groundwork for both these asset bubbles by lowering interest rates to historic lows . 
In an attempt to protect his legacy after the Internet-bubble collapse , Greenspan provided unprecedented stimulus to re-inflate the economy and maintain his popularity with Wall Street . 
-LRB- Remember the `` Greenspan put '' ? -RRB- 
But in doing so , he spawned the largest debt and asset bubble in U.S. history . 
At the same time , federal regulatory agencies such as the SEC stood idly by as Wall Street took advantage of the investment public during both the Internet and the housing bubbles . 
The SEC took almost no action against Wall Street after the dot-com implosion . 
And in the midst of the housing bubble , in 2006 , only the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency pushed for any level of regulation to address subprime lending . 
One has to wonder why Treasury secretaries under Presidents Clinton and Bush -- Robert Rubin and Hank Paulson , respectively -- took no action to curb these abuses . 
It certainly was not because they did not understand Wall Street 's practices -- both are former chief executives of Goldman Sachs . 
And why has Congress been so silent ? 
The Wall Street investment banking firms , their executives , their families and their political action committees contribute more to U.S. Senate and House campaigns than any other industry in America . 
By sprinkling some of its massive gains into the pockets of our elected officials , Wall Street bought itself protection from any tough government enforcement . 
This is no doubt the same reason why so many members of Congress were consistently blocking attempts to reform and downsize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which are essentially giant , undercapitalized hedge funds . 
These two entities have been huge money machines for Democrats in both the House and the Senate , many of whom recently had the gall to ask why these companies had n't been reformed in the past . 
Nor should several Republican congressmen and Senators who likewise contributed to watering down legislation aimed at reforming these institutions be let off the hook . 
Wall Street 's actions are now profoundly hurting American families , communities and the entire U.S. financial system . 
People are being thrown out of their homes . 
Once seemingly indestructible financial entities are succumbing to the crisis they have created and have jeopardized the stability of the global financial system . 
Is n't it ironic that the same firms that preached free-market capitalism are now the ones begging for a taxpayer bailout ? 
Many investment professionals operating in my world believe , as do I , that we are facing the greatest financial crisis since 1929 . 
Fortunately , today we have safety nets , such as federal deposit insurance , that were non-existent during the Great Depression . 
Yet there has not been a time since the 1920s when Wall Street has enjoyed as much influence over Washington as it has for the last 12 years . 
Let 's hope that this influence fades rapidly -- and that this financial crisis does n't end the same way as the one of nearly 80 years ago .

"Financial Crisis In Russia Raises Stakes for Putin A trader in Moscow pauses Friday to make a call . 
Stock market indexes are less than half what they were in May , erasing nearly $ 800 billion of paper value . 
-LRB- By Misha Japaridze -- Associated Press -RRB- MOSCOW , Sept. 20 -- For the past eight years , the political strength of Russia 's leader , Vladimir Putin , has rested on what seemed an unbeatable combination -- a soaring economy that raised average incomes eightfold and a steady drive to consolidate control over government , media and business that stifled any meaningful opposition . 
But the turmoil in the past week in the stock markets and banks here has suddenly taken some of the shine off the Russian economy and has raised questions about the continuing viability of the Putin formula . 
Emerging markets around the world suffered in the fallout of the U.S. financial crisis as access to credit evaporated and investors sold shares to cover losses elsewhere . 
But stocks in Russia fell harder and faster than in any other major market . 
Banks appeared to be paralyzed , spooked by rumors of defaults , and unwilling or unable to issue loans . 
Stock market indexes plunged to three-year lows , forcing the Kremlin to adopt emergency measures . 
Even after a rally Friday , the market has fallen more than 50 percent since May , erasing nearly $ 800 billion in paper value . 
The crisis presents the government with the most serious test of its economy since 1998 , when Russia defaulted on debt payments and the ruble collapsed . 
Putin is seen as the leader who delivered Russia from those troubles , presiding over 7 percent annual growth that has cut poverty in half , enlarged the middle class and transformed Moscow into one of the most expensive cities in the world . 
At the same time , the public has largely accepted his rollback of democratic reforms ; many consider it a key factor in their nation 's recovery . 
The Kremlin is much better positioned to confront the current crisis than the last one . 
With virtually no debt , a budget surplus and more than $ 550 billion in foreign currency reserves , as well as other reserve funds totaling at least $ 172 billion , the government has been able thus far to prevent a run on banks and contain the financial turmoil . 
`` All fundamental indicators of the Russian economy are within the norm , '' Putin told an investment forum Friday as the Kremlin offered $ 44 billion in emergency loans to the country 's top banks and unveiled a plan to spend as much as $ 20 billion more to bolster the market by buying shares . 
But critics warned that the economy remains too dependent on oil exports and that Russia is still dominated by a political system that is viewed by foreign investors as unpredictable and often hostile . 
`` It 's not just oil prices , but the whole environment , '' said Oleg Buklemishev , chief analyst for MK Analytica and a former economic official in the government . 
`` They have a big war chest , but the money is concentrated in just a few places , and they do n't know how to disseminate it and use it to drive the economy . '' 
Putin has re-nationalized key industries and expanded the state 's role in the economy , but the state sector remains corrupt and inefficient , and the emergency measures will result in the state controlling even more , Buklemishev said . 
`` Much will depend on how they behave now ... If they do n't make the proper moves , the reserves could be spent pretty quickly . '' 
The Russian stock market hit its peak in May after Putin stepped down as president and installed his handpicked successor , Dmitry Medvedev , who promptly appointed him prime minister . 
Investors appeared encouraged by Putin 's selection of Medvedev , who presented himself as a moderate in favor of economic and political reforms . 
But in late May , a bitter fight for control of the nation 's third-largest oil company , TNK-BP , unfolded . 
The Russian tycoons who owned half the firm appeared to enlist the help of government officials against their partner , British energy giant BP . 
The authorities launched a tax probe into the firm , raided its offices and refused to renew the visas of most of its foreign employees . 
Robert Dudley , the chief executive backed by BP , was forced to leave the country July 24 .

"Economic Crisis : Some Are Guilty All Are Responsible Well , I guess the conservative philosophy of `` faith '' in free markets that has dominated America for the past 28 years since Ronald Reagan and which was adopted by the religious `` right '' as if it was gospel has now been revealed to be what classic religious teaching would call idolatry . 
And I guess mistrust of government , another conservative article of `` faith '' , has turned out to be one of those morally relative judgments now that private financial institutions need bailing out . 
And I guess the basic religious and spiritual notions of accountability and taking responsibility have been annulled with regard to financial leaders and their institutions that need to be `` saved '' . 
And clearly the core obligations the powerful and affluent have to care for the vulnerable and poor are secondary to the `` commandment '' to rescue the wealthy . 
Our economy 's recent and yet to be financial failures , the likes of which we have not seen since the Depression , are profound moral failures . 
Anytime a society has millions of people lose their homes and jobs , major institutions disappear over night , and its citizens experience unprecedented levels of insecurity , uncertainty , and anxiety about the future there is a moral issue with moral implications . 
Of course , the first round of reaction we can expect is the typical low-level blame game between Republicans and Democrats , liberals and conservatives , free market economists and interventionists , supply-siders and Keynesians , and the poor and middle and wealthy classes . 
But no great moral or spiritual insight is required to know that the moral failure that has led to our present crisis is as old as human beings - in a word GREED and it would be far too easy for any `` us '' to simply blame some other `` them '' and thereby deflect and project our responsibility on someone else . 
And there are many of `` us '' . 
There are the hundred or so people at the head of each of these `` stalwart '' financial institutions whose greed led to decisions all along the way which destroyed their institutions . 
There are the brilliant and innovative financiers , who developed incredibly complex investment vehicles which were supposed to spread risk , whose greed actually blinded them to risk as they and their investors `` earned '' ungodly sums of money . 
There are the politicians on both sides of the aisle who failed in their roles as servants , representatives , and protectors of the people whose greed to maintain their power kept them from telling their constituents the truth that not everyone can own a home and limited their ability to tell their powerful supporters that regulations that had been gutted under President Clinton were indeed needed . 
There are the nine federal agencies responsible for overseeing some part of the mortgage market and there are the real estate brokers whose greed inspired them to break every `` rule '' in seducing people with mortgages that were beyond buyer 's means . 
And then there is us : regular Main Street American home owners whose greed compelled us to take on mortgages -LRB- or second mortgages -RRB- that we knew were too good to be true in order to support consumption well beyond our means . 
Every religious and spiritual wisdom tradition suggests that great moments of collective trauma or suffering are also invitations - not for flight -LRB- turning inwards to simply protect ourselves -RRB- or fight -LRB- blaming others -RRB- - but to honestly self-reflect , introspect , and grow . 
Obviously , some people are guiltier than others for this economic crisis but in an interdependent reality all are responsible . 
From a religious or psycho-spiritual perspective we begin a genuine and healthy process of reconstruction and renewal when each of us , wherever we are on the continuum of `` power '' and `` influence '' is prepared to ask : What did I do that may have contributed to where we collectively find ourselves ? 
What personal responsibility do I have for what is happening ? 
In what ways did I buy into an economic model completely built upon greater and greater consumption - a system in which our ever expanding desires far too easily are turned into needs ? 
How has my understanding of happiness and success -LRB- getting , amassing , having , and consuming more and more -RRB- distorted my values and fed my greed ? 
How much did I hide myself from the truth I knew deep down - that something was wrong as there is no easy credit in life : credit needs to be merited earned . 
Yes , there has been serious moral failure that has led to this economic wreckage and moral failure requires accountability . 
Accountability begins with ourselves and then and only then can legitimately be extended outwards to those who do in fact carry greater responsibility . 
So let 's start to rebuild our social contract which has been eroded by the age old vice of greed . 
Not by descending into a blame game but by each of us seriously asking ourselves three simple moral questions : What did I do to help get us to this place ? 
What do I need to change with regard to my own behavior ? 
What can I do to help the most vulnerable of my fellow citizens - those who more hurt and vulnerable than I am - and there is always someone more vulnerable than we are ? 
-LRB- For those who enjoy a Biblical reference : Where are you ? 
and Where is your brother ? -RRB- 
And let 's stop having faith in the economy and begin to have faith in each other - trusting that the happiness that comes from greed is transient at best while the happiness that comes from giving , serving and even sacrificing for each other is far more enduring and credit-worthy . 
The reason why we are in this FINANCIAL MESS is because all those holes came into play at full throttle . 
Some people simply abused the weakness of the dollar for their benefit . 
Upon seeing the weakness of the dollar , they played up the price of oil . 
They can do it because as we have seen last Monday , there is no regulation that can stop them from doing so . 
With very high oil prices , the companies become vulnerable and weak . 
Here comes the SHORT SELLERS taking advantage of that weakness and betted that the stock prices of these companies would fail . 
As a result of stocks plunging , many companies struggled and many could have borrowed money from banks and in the process raised the interest rates . 
Also , profits from short selling contribute to excess liquidity and to offset this liquidity , interest rates are raised . 
As interest rates climbed , so does the mortgage interest rates . 
Many homeowners defaulted which put banks on a tough situation . 
Again the SHORT SELLERS saw the opportunity to profit so they came BETTING AGAINST the banks until we see all these big banks failed . 
Now , we can see that there are THREE BIG SUCKING HOLES that came into play that put us into this mess . 
The FIRST are the SPECULATORS who played up THE PRICE OF OIL . 
The SECOND are SHORT SELLERS which pulled down the stock market . 
The resulting HOLE -LRB- third hole -RRB- which these two sucking holes created are the FORECLOSED houses which continue to burden the financial system . 
The SOLUTION to this mess is simply to PLUG UP these THREE HOLES . 
First is to create an OIL PRICE STABILIZATION LAW which I explained in my earlier posts . 
Second is to PERMANENTLY BAN SHORT SELLERS . 
Thirdly , if they want a bailout , it should be used to relieve the homeowners by lowering their mortgage interest payments and return the foreclosed houses to its previous owners under a restructured payment scheme that 's affordable . 
The third solution will release the banks from bad debt and can therefore continue and start clean anew . 
The hedgefunds which will be affected by the ban on short selling can look for MORE PRODUCTIVE investments like the manufacturing sectors and new technologies sectors . 
This shift of investment would lower interest rates because manufacturers would not be crowding in the banks for loans . 
This will also make our manufacturing sectors competitive . 
As a result more jobs will be created . 
This is WIN-ALL SCENARIO and to achieve this , THESE THREE HOLES MUST BE ATTENDED TO , otherwise , NO BAILOUT WILL SUCCEED . 
The reason why the U.S economy is so vulnerable to Wall Street speculation is because of SHORT SELLING . 
The economists DO NOT REALIZE that these people -LRB- short sellers -RRB- are like PRINTING MONEY UNHINDERED . 
Earning money at the expense of others -LRB- short selling -RRB- is NOT EARNING BUT STEALING . 
It 's the same reason why we ca n't print money freely because it is tantamount to stealing . 
UNLESS the regulators BAN THIS SHORT SELLING IN THE STOCK MARKET , Americans will continue to SUFFER ECONOMICALLY as what is happening now . 
The ENEMIES of America does not need an airplane to crash to our buildings . 
They only need to PLAY UP THE OIL PRICE IN THE STOCK MARKET and then start BETTING ON THE OTHER STOCKS TO FAIL thru SHORT SELLING . 
Not only can they ruin the economy of America , but they can also make themselves rich by doing so . 
NOW WHERE ARE THE BRAINS OF OUR LEADERS AND ANALYSTS ? 
BAN SHORT-SELLING AND IMPLEMENT THAT OIL PRICE STABILIZATION MECHANISM NOW and all will be well again . 
That 700 billion dollar bail-out should be used to relieve American homeowners by lowering their mortgage interest rates and those who already lost their homes should be asked to return with their payments restructured . 
We have seen how the price of oil jumped 16 points in just one day for no valid reason . 
It 's very clear that the government -LRB- both Congress and the executive branch -RRB- has NOT DONE anything to rein-in speculators . 
It is therefore NOT farfetched that oil would rise up again to an all time high as before . 
I hope they would now legislate a bill that would rein-in the STUPIDITY of these speculators . 
Oil has been the lifeblood of world economy and people should not be allowed to play on this commodity . 
It 's very clear that the speculators are not using their minds . 
They do not understand that they are slowly hanging themselves as the price of oil shoots up to where the economy can not perform anymore . 
Their money would be deemed useless if there would be a work stoppage worldwide . 
I hope Congress would make a law that would put a price cap on oil everytime speculators are playing with it . 
If the price of oil today -LRB- Monday -RRB- is 120 dollars per barrel , the price cap tomorrow -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- should be 120 dollars per barrel . 
Since it can not go up that price , there would be massive panic selling which would pull down it 's price . 
If the price of oil closes at 110 dollars tomorrow -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- , the price cap should be set at 110 dollars per barrel on Wednesday . 
There is no way to go for the price of oil but DOWN if this mechanism would be put into place . 
Once the oil price reaches a SANE LEVEL of maybe about 90 dollars , regulators can then SWITCH-OFF that mechanism so it can settle to it 's true value . 
There must be a body that can switch that mechanism on or off as the need requires . 
We NEED THAT MECHANISM NOW AND CONGRESS SHOULD ACT NOW BEFORE THESE IDIOTIC SPECULATORS WOULD HAMMER THE ECONOMY AGAIN . 
The foundation of the capitalism is the selfish human nature , and the stock market , while drawing out capitals otherwise tucked under beds , is in fact to encourage one rob millions with a few key punches in the cubicle of a merry and innocent-looking glass building without seeing a pain-twisted face or hearing an anguish cry of the robbed , and without awakening the warm-hearted animal of guilt in shallow and uneasy sleep . 
Yes , someone could follow your advice , have a profound reflection , and become a saint . 
But at most the society gains one hermetic eccentric , a laughable nuisance , a sore loser in the eyes of people swimming along the mainstream . 
The cruel joke is that , no matter where he hides , he ca n't escape from being robbed , because the wealth of the world is re-distributed with every key stroke of the Wall Street traders if Warren Buffet makes $ 1 billion today , we each must in some way contribute unless we count consumer confidence as commodity . 
The saddest casualty of the capitalist triumph is the total collapse of sense of care in health care . 
As health care is put on price-tags in the market like a smuggled girl in a red district , all the human compassion is striped bare and `` care '' becomes a misnomer : all but a few people are in it for the money and the sick are no more than milking cows . 
The intricate healthcare market makes the concept of care almost hypocritical ; doctors , administrators , and everyone else could all let loose of their greedy instincts in pursuing the green bills without any moral afflictions , because , in the open market , they never directly take money from the sick and frail they take `` care '' of . 
Doctors simply demand more from insurers and government what they deserve , and insurers demand more from the insured with all good reasons , government borrow more from China without worrying who will eventually pay . 
So here is our market system that sugar-coat greed so perfectly and deliriously , until one day everything sinks into the global-warmed , elevated ocean .

`` Give the people of the United States the facts which reach our government with regard to events in all areas in which the freedom of the American press is in any way restricted . '' 
In our society the people decide for themselves what is best and the press supports the people . 
The government does n't always like that , but it beats having a ruined press and ignorant people that are both powerless . 
Invest in the newspaper business and use some of the profit to help those less fortunate . 
Wall Street can help itself . 
It will do about as well as those it helps . 
The economy just keeps rolling forward along with the presses . 
Some people would like to stop both and it just ca n't be done . 
You ca n't stop the rain . 
Take an umbrella if it looks like rain . 
It looks like rain here at the estate , so the garden should be happy . 
That 's where my lunch is now growing out of the ground , so I better go pick lunch . 
Some things you ca n't pick , so you need to choose . 
Choices are good and options are many . 
But somehow I doubt it . 
And I do n't mean ` sacrificing ' by letting the government spend tons of taxpayer money to bail everyone out . 
Real sacrifice is on an individual level . 
And there 's plenty of people who are very deserving of the charity of those who were either better-prepared for this , or just lucky enough not to get hurt by everything happening . 
I am not responsible . 
I 've spent a lifetime being ridiculed because I did NOT jump on the gravy train - did NOT live beyond my means - No , religion does not call it idolatry - religion calls it USURY - And unless you are free form it 's influence in your own life - you do n't really have the moral high ground to assume that everyone else is guilty . 
People will not ask themselves these questions - and as soon as the DOW bumps up a bit - people will promptly forget and revert to their ususal consumptive ways .

"`` The queen had only one way of settling all difficulties , great or small . 
` Off with his head ! ' 
she said without even looking around . '' 
-- `` Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland '' Under the pressure of the financial crisis , one presidential candidate is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high . 
It is not Barack Obama . 
Channeling his inner Queen of Hearts , John McCain furiously , and apparently without even looking around at facts , said Chris Cox , chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , should be decapitated . 
This childish reflex provoked the Wall Street Journal to editorialize that `` McCain untethered '' -- disconnected from knowledge and principle -- had made a `` false and deeply unfair '' attack on Cox that was `` unpresidential '' and demonstrated that McCain `` does n't understand what 's happening on Wall Street any better than Barack Obama does . '' 
To read the Journal 's details about the depths of McCain 's shallowness on the subject of Cox 's chairmanship , see '' McCain 's Scapegoat '' -LRB- Sept. 19 -RRB- . 
Then consider McCain 's characteristic accusation that Cox `` has betrayed the public 's trust . '' 
Perhaps an old antagonism is involved in McCain 's fact-free slander . 
His most conspicuous economic adviser is Douglas Holtz-Eakin , who previously headed the Congressional Budget Office . 
There he was an impediment to conservatives , including then-Rep . 
Cox , who , as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee , persistently tried and generally failed to enlist CBO support for `` dynamic scoring '' that would estimate the economic growth effects of proposed tax cuts . 
In any case , McCain 's smear -- that Cox `` betrayed the public 's trust '' -- is a harbinger of a McCain presidency . 
For McCain , politics is always operatic , pitting people who agree with him against those who are `` corrupt '' or `` betray the public 's trust , '' two categories that seem to be exhaustive -- there are no other people . 
McCain 's Manichaean worldview drove him to his signature legislative achievement , the McCain-Feingold law 's restrictions on campaigning . 
Today , his campaign is creatively finding interstices in laws intended to restrict campaign giving and spending . 
-LRB- For details , see The Post of Sept. 17 ; and the New York Times of Sept. 19 . -RRB- 
By a Gresham 's Law of political discourse , McCain 's Queen of Hearts intervention in the opaque financial crisis overshadowed a solid conservative complaint from the Republican Study Committee , chaired by Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas . 
In a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , the RSC decried the improvised torrent of bailouts as a `` dangerous and unmistakable precedent for the federal government both to be looked to and indeed relied upon to save private sector companies from the consequences of their poor economic decisions . '' 
This letter , listing just $ 650 billion of the perhaps more than $ 1 trillion in new federal exposures to risk , was sent while McCain 's campaign , characteristically substituting vehemence for coherence , was airing an ad warning that Obama favors `` massive government , billions in spending increases . '' 
The political left always aims to expand the permeation of economic life by politics . 
Today , the efficient means to that end is government control of capital . 
So , is not McCain 's party now conducting the most leftist administration in American history ? 
The New Deal never acted so precipitously on such a scale . 
Treasury Secretary Paulson , asked about conservative complaints that his rescue program amounts to socialism , said , essentially : This is not socialism , this is necessary . 
That non sequitur might be politically necessary , but remember that government control of capital is government control of capitalism . 
Does McCain have qualms about this , or only quarrels ? 
On '' 60 Minutes '' Sunday evening , McCain , saying `` this may sound a little unusual , '' said that he would like to replace Cox with Andrew Cuomo , the Democratic attorney general of New York who is the son of former governor Mario Cuomo . 
McCain explained that Cuomo has `` respect '' and `` prestige '' and could `` lend some bipartisanship . '' 
Conservatives have been warned . 
Conservatives who insist that electing McCain is crucial usually start , and increasingly end , by saying he would make excellent judicial selections . 
But the more one sees of his impulsive , intensely personal reactions to people and events , the less confidence one has that he would select judges by calm reflection and clear principles , having neither patience nor aptitude for either . 
It is arguable that , because of his inexperience , Obama is not ready for the presidency . 
It is arguable that McCain , because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes , is not suited to the presidency . 
Unreadiness can be corrected , although perhaps at great cost , by experience . 
Can a dismaying temperament be fixed ? 
"
"Of all the self-proclaimed experts I wanted to hear from about the financial crisis , the one I looked forward to the most was Nick Leeson , late of Britain 's Barings Bank . 
In 1995 , he bet hugely on Nikkei futures -LRB- whatever they are -RRB- and lost something like $ 1.4 billion . 
Leeson was 28 years old and often drunk , Barings was 233 years old and in fiduciary senility . 
Leeson went to prison , Barings went bust and Wall Street , without so much as a pause , went on its merry way . 
Sadly , Leeson did not have much to say about the current financial crisis . 
Writing last week in the Guardian , he instead expressed bitterness that the former owners of Barings went on with their lives while he spent 41\/2 years in prison . 
What he did not say , to the regret of us all , is how once again the kids were allowed to play with huge amounts of money without any adult supervision . 
`` I was astonished that nobody stopped me , '' he wrote in his book `` Rogue Trader . '' 
`` People in London should have known . '' 
The theme in the current financial crisis is not , as John McCain would have it , greed , since that , like lust , will be with us forever . 
Instead , it is transparency . 
Leeson , you may recall , was dealing from Singapore in exotic derivatives that his bosses in London little understood . 
All they knew was that Leeson was putting huge profits on the books , not that those books had anything to do with reality . 
Somewhat the same thing happened on Wall Street . 
The complicated , exotic and downright erotic financial instruments cooked up at the investment houses were , in fact , little understood not only by the buyers but also by the sellers . 
You can see that from what they said and from what they did : Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , AIG and others all held on to financial instruments that were worth less than they once thought . 
This was truly a case of the blind leading the blind . 
`` The problem is that nobody knows what any institution owns and what the terms of the securities they own are and what they 're worth , '' New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday on `` Meet the Press . '' 
He 's saying what others on the Street having been saying for some time : Nobody knows what these things -- securitized mortgages , etc. -- are worth . 
And , just to darken the mystery -LRB- and maybe your mood -RRB- , no one knows the value of the underlying real estate , either . 
I started with Leeson for a reason . 
He is the personification of a generational gap in the finance industry . 
He was young and computer-savvy , and his bosses in London were neither . 
That was true on Wall Street , too . 
The very top guys really had little idea of what was going on below . 
Everything was going right . 
They were making lots of money , which they deserved -- in their wonderful circular reasoning -- because they were making it . 
This , I tell you , is the true magic of the vaunted market : It justifies both stupidity and greed . 
Now the government is proposing another pig in a poke . 
The huge federal bailout is necessary , but Democrats are right to insist on detail and oversight . 
For too long , the financial markets have operated without much of either . 
Now the Bush administration is asking Congress for a blank check , what New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine calls the `` moral equivalent '' of the congressional resolution that wound up authorizing the Iraq war . 
Corzine , a former Goldman Sachs chairman -LRB- not to mention U.S. senator -RRB- , is a voice worth heeding nowadays . 
When I talked to him , he had just gotten hold of the two-page administration program . 
This is another exotic financial instrument . 
The wise words of William Goldman , the screenwriter , should echo in Congress 's ears . 
He not only coined the phrase `` follow the money '' for `` All the President 's Men , '' but he expressed the sum total of knowledge about the making of movies with : `` Nobody knows anything . '' 
The same has been true about opaque financial instruments . 
It 's up to Congress to fix that . 
The lesson of Leeson has yet to be learned . 
Financial markets have moved well beyond the trading of things that could be seen or measured or weighed . 
On Wall Street , older men employed the lingo of younger men to pretend they knew what was happening -- but they did n't . 
Now , Congress is being asked to do something similar . 
That wo n't do . 
Do n't be afraid to regulate . 
Act as if you 're the government , for crying out loud . 
Because if you do n't do this right , you soon wo n't be .

"The Bush administration sent some of its most powerful figures to Capitol Hill yesterday to rally support for a $ 700 billion plan to revive the U.S. financial system , but they encountered stiff resistance from lawmakers who are deeply skeptical of the proposal and angered by the administration 's push for its speedy approval . 
The issue transcended party lines . 
Democrats voiced doubts , and many Republicans , particularly in the House , balked at the entreaties from Cheney , Bolten and other officials . 
`` Just because God created the world in seven days does n't mean we have to pass this bill in seven days , '' Rep. Joe Barton -LRB- R-Tex . -RRB- 
said after exiting a two-hour meeting with Cheney . 
Democratic leaders warned that they would not approve the biggest government intervention in the private markets since the Great Depression without significant Republican support . 
`` It 's their problem . 
It 's their bill . 
And they 're going to have to figure out if they can support it , '' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- . 
Paulson and Bernanke , meanwhile , defended themselves before the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee , where senators fumed that the administration had abetted the meltdown in the markets by failing to halt the spread of exotic home loans that are now falling into foreclosure at a record pace . 
A wide array of firms bought complicated financial instruments backed by those mortgages ; the administration is proposing to purchase those troubled assets to help those firms stay afloat . 
At times yesterday , Paulson and Bernanke almost seemed to echo the outrage from their questioners . 
`` I 'm not only concerned , I 'm angry about the things that got us here , '' Paulson said . 
`` It makes me angry , and it makes you angry . 
You talk about taxpayers being on the hook ? 
They 're already on the hook . 
If the system is n't stabilized , they 're going to bear the cost . '' 
The vice president got a warmer reception during a luncheon with Senate Republicans . 
But afterward , key GOP senators announced that they now agree with Democratic demands that the bailout package set limits on executive salaries at financial institutions that participate in the program . 
Democrats have argued that chief executives whose companies accept taxpayer money should not be permitted to pocket millions of dollars in bonuses or big severance packages known as `` golden parachutes . '' 
Paulson and the White House have objected to limits on executive compensation , saying limits would discourage successful firms from participating in the bailout . 
`` These are not all weak or troubled firms that own mortgage-backed securities , '' said White House spokesman Tony Fratto . 
`` They were not necessarily irresponsible players , and so you have to be careful about how you deal with them . '' 
But Republican senators , many of whom face voters in six weeks , have concluded otherwise . 
`` I think executive compensation ought to be part of this , '' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -LRB- R-Ky . -RRB- 
`` I think the taxpayers should expect no less than strict limits on what kind of executive compensation might be possible for those involved in these partially government-controlled enterprises . ''

"NEW YORK , Sept. 24 -- John McCain is a gambler by nature , and the bet he placed Wednesday may be among the biggest of his political life . 
The Republican presidential nominee is hoping that his abrupt decision to suspend campaigning , seek a delay of Friday 's debate with Democrat Barack Obama , and return to Washington to help prod negotiations over a financial rescue package will be seen as the kind of country-first , bipartisan leadership he believes Americans want . 
What he risks , if things do n't go as he hopes , is a judgment by voters that his move was a reckless act by an impetuous and struggling politician that hardened partisan lines in Washington at just the wrong moment and complicated efforts to deal with the biggest financial crisis in more than half a century . 
McCain laid out his rationale in stark terms , saying that the economy is in crisis and that he does not believe the package now on the table in Washington can win enough votes to pass . 
`` Americans across our country lament the fact that partisan divisions in Washington have prevented us from addressing our national challenges , '' he said here in New York . 
`` Now is our chance to come together to prove that Washington is once again capable of leading this country . '' 
In the heated atmosphere of Wednesday afternoon , as the two campaigns plotted and maneuvered around each other , it was impossible to know what the ultimate verdict would be on McCain 's surprise decision . 
He managed once again , at least in the short term , to shake up the presidential race at a time when national and state polls show Obama opening up a clear lead . 
And by day 's end , he had forced his rival to blink . 
Obama initially resisted McCain 's call to join him and return to Washington . 
But hours later he was forced to capitulate when President Bush called him and asked him to participate in a White House meeting with congressional leaders and his GOP rival . 
Shortly after that , the two candidates issued a joint statement calling for action . 
But while agreeing to go back to Washington , Obama insisted Wednesday night , as he had earlier in the day , that Friday 's debate go ahead as scheduled . 
`` I believe that we should continue to have the debate , '' he told reporters in Florida , where he is preparing for it . 
`` I think that it makes sense for us to present ourselves before the American people , to talk about the nature of the problems that we 're having in our financial system , to talk about how it relates to our global standing in the world , what implications it has for our national security , how it relates to critical questions like the war in Iraq and Afghanistan . '' 
Much now will depend on whether McCain can deliver results and whether there is a constructive role for him and Obama , or whether they become a sideshow to the real negotiations . 
But Obama 's course carries risks as well , if he looked as if he were standing on the sidelines while McCain pushed for intervention that could help avert further damage to the nation 's economy . 
The standoff over the debate left both candidates in potentially awkward positions , although there is plenty of time for it to be resolved . 
McCain may be reluctant to climb down from his insistence that the debate be delayed until there is an agreement on a package , but he could be seen as scuttling an important event for voters eager to see the two candidates side by side . 
Obama , on the other hand , may look high-handed if he insists on going ahead as negotiations in Washington reach a critical moment by this weekend . 
At a minimum , voters were treated again to contrasting styles of leadership Wednesday , with McCain willing to act boldly , if impulsively , to inject himself into the middle of delicate negotiations to force a solution , and Obama adopting a cooler approach designed to show calm in the midst of crisis while preferring to give long-distance encouragement to all parties in the talks . 
Partisan lines hardened quickly after McCain 's statement . 
Republican leaders rallied around McCain . 
Former House speaker Newt Gingrich said the decision to suspend campaigning and lend a hand to the negotiations in Washington was `` the greatest single act of responsibility ever taken by a presidential candidate . '' 
He said it rivaled Dwight Eisenhower 's declaration during the 1952 campaign that he would go to Korea as president , if necessary , to help end the conflict there . 
`` This is the day the McCain-reform Republican Party began to truly emerge as a movement which puts country first , solutions first , and big change first , '' he said in a statement . 
House Minority Leader John A. Boehner -LRB- R-Ohio -RRB- said he strongly supported McCain 's call for a bipartisan leadership meeting . 
`` Given that it is only a few months before a new President takes the oath of office , '' he said in a statement , `` it is vital that the next President play an active role in crafting this critical plan . '' 
But privately , three Republican strategists were sharply critical , viewing McCain 's decision as a high-risk move that entails uncertain negotiations in Washington at the possible expense of a debate they believe McCain badly needs to get back on the offensive . 
One strategist called the move `` desperate and nuts , '' and another said in an e-mail , `` I do n't get it at all . '' 
All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to criticize McCain publicly . 
Democrats denounced McCain 's move as political grandstanding , and they quickly urged Obama to stay away . 
Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid -LRB- D-Nev . -RRB- 
, no friend of McCain 's , said the country would be better served if McCain and Obama went ahead with their debate . 
`` If that changes , we will call upon them . 
We need leadership , not a campaign photo op , '' he said in a statement . 
McCain advisers dismissed Reid 's statement as both raw partisanship and particularly disingenuous , coming as it did just a day after the Senate leader had urged McCain to make his views on the current financial package clear and warned him against a `` no '' vote that could scuttle the entire rescue . 
Senate Democratic Whip Richard J. Durbin -LRB- Ill. -RRB- said McCain 's move was motivated not by concerns about stock market declines but by the GOP nominee 's sagging poll numbers . 
`` It 's not economic leadership that Senator McCain would bring to these negotiations , '' he said in a statement . 
`` It 's presidential politics -- which is the last thing we need if we really want to solve the serious problems our nation faces . '' 
Democratic strategists were even sharper in their criticism . 
`` McCain is doing this without having laid any predicate for the idea that his participation is crucial to the process , '' said pollster Geoff Garin . 
`` His activity for the last seven days or more completely belies that ... This is not going to be seen as either an act of strength or act of confidence . '' 
Mark Mellman , another Democratic pollster , said Wednesday 's move , like McCain 's pick of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate , was a political stunt aimed at stirring up the race . 
`` McCain thinks he learned with Palin that shaking things up when you are falling behind can pay off , '' he said . 
`` It did then , albeit briefly . 
It wo n't now . '' 
McCain is betting otherwise . 
On the biggest issue in the election , one that favors his rival , the Republican nominee believes he can buck the odds and produce results . 
It may not take long to know whether the gamble paid off . ''

-LRB- By Jason Reed -- Reuters -RRB- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama will abandon the campaign trail today for a bipartisan meeting at the White House , as the financial crisis gripping the nation roils the presidential race and leaves the first debate between the nominees in limbo . 
Obama agreed to the meeting after a phone call yesterday evening from President Bush , the finale of a remarkable day in which McCain tried to change the dynamics of the race by announcing that he would `` suspend '' his campaign until the crisis is solved and called on Obama to do the same . 
With the economy moving squarely to the forefront of Americans ' concerns and polls showing that voters trust Obama more than McCain to fix it , the Republican nominee made what he hoped would be a game-changing gambit yesterday : leave the campaign trail , delay tomorrow 's debate and call for Obama to join him in trying to fashion an alternative to the Bush administration 's $ 700 billion bailout of Wall Street before financial markets open on Monday morning . 
`` I am calling on the president to convene a meeting with the leadership from both houses of Congress , including Senator Obama and myself , '' McCain said in a hastily arranged appearance in New York , during which he declined to answer reporters ' questions . 
`` It is time for both parties to come together to solve this problem . '' 
His aides said he was unilaterally pulling his campaign ads and ceasing fundraising activities . 
Obama initially resisted the idea of returning to Washington , saying injecting `` presidential politics '' into the congressional negotiations might do more harm than good . 
And he said McCain 's gesture was unnecessary . 
`` It is going to be part of the president 's job to deal with more than one thing at once , '' Obama said at a news conference late yesterday afternoon called in response to McCain 's appearance . 
`` I think there 's no reason why we ca n't be constructive in helping to solve this problem and also tell the American people what we believe , and where we stand , and where we want to take the country . '' 
But after Bush did exactly as McCain had requested in calling the meeting , the Democrat had no choice but to agree . 
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said the senator from Illinois has been working all week with congressional leaders and administration officials `` to improve this proposal , and he has said that he will continue to work in a bipartisan spirit and do whatever is necessary to come up with a final solution . '' 
But Burton said the first presidential debate , to be held tomorrow in Oxford , Miss. , should go on as planned . 
Obama `` strongly believes the debate should go forward on Friday so that the American people can hear from their next president about how he will lead America forward at this defining moment for our country , '' Burton said . 
The debate is slated to be the first of three between the candidates . 
The Commission on Presidential Debates took the unusual step last night of issuing a statement indirectly but unmistakably pressuring McCain to stick to the original schedule : `` We believe the public will be well served by having all of the debates go forward as scheduled . '' 
But if McCain does not attend , `` there wo n't be a debate , '' said one person involved in the negotiations . 
The event could be changed to another date , and McCain aides said that `` everything was on the table '' when it came to rescheduling the debate . 
That includes the possibility of holding it next Thursday , when the vice presidential nominees -- Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. -LRB- D-Del . -RRB- 
and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin -- are scheduled to face off , and delaying their debate .

"Bailout Could Deepen Crisis , CBO Chief Says Peter R. Orszag , director of the Congressional Budget Office , testifies on Capitol Hill yesterday . 
-LRB- By Brendan Hoffman -- Getty Images -RRB- The director of the Congressional Budget Office said yesterday that the proposed Wall Street bailout could actually worsen the current financial crisis . 
`` Ironically , the intervention could even trigger additional failures of large institutions , because some institutions may be carrying troubled assets on their books at inflated values , '' Orszag said in his testimony . 
`` Establishing clearer prices might reveal those institutions to be insolvent . '' 
In an interview later yesterday , Orszag explained using the following example : Suppose a company has Asset X , whose value is recorded on the books as $ 100 . 
Because of the current economic decline , Asset X 's real value has dropped to $ 50 . 
If the company takes part in the government bailout and sells Asset X for $ 50 , the company has to report a $ 50 loss on its books . 
On a scale of millions of dollars , such write-downs could ruin a company . 
Such companies `` look solvent today only because it 's kind of hidden , '' Orszag said . 
`` They actually are insolvent '' already , he said . 
In hearings on Capitol Hill so far this week , criticism of the bailout plan put forward by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has largely been restricted to the shape of the $ 700 billion proposal , how the money will be spent and what sort of oversight Treasury should have . 
But Orszag yesterday questioned the wisdom of the plan itself , testifying that `` it therefore remains uncertain whether the program will be sufficient to restore trust . '' 
In yesterday 's interview , Orszag said , `` The key question is : What are we buying and what are we paying for it ? '' 
Orszag offered alternatives , such as equity injections into particularly troubled companies , but allowed that those could lead to further problems , as well . 
In the end , he said , Congress must pass some sort of relief , if only because Wall Street is expecting it . 
`` If we did nothing , there is a significant risk of another collapse of confidence in the financial markets , '' he said . 
Then , there is the paperwork cost of the bailout . 
The budget office `` expects that the administrative costs of operating the program could amount to a few billion dollars per year , as long as the government held all or most of the purchased assets , '' he testified , without defining what he meant by `` a few . ''

"Bush Calls Bailout Vital to Economy , Will Meet With McCain and Obama President Bush said yesterday that the credit crisis that has seized world markets could devastate the U.S. economy unless Congress acts quickly to approve a $ 700 billion bailout plan for the nation 's financial system , a message aimed at reluctant lawmakers as much as a deeply skeptical public . 
`` Our entire economy is in danger , '' Bush said in an address from the White House , emphasizing that the massive bailout was not targeted at `` any individual company or industry . 
It is aimed at preserving America 's overall economy . '' 
Warning that `` America could slip into a financial panic , '' Bush blamed the crisis on `` easy credit '' in the housing market and `` the faulty assumption that home values would continue to rise . '' 
As mortgage loans went bad and borrowers defaulted , he said , investors have succumbed to a `` widespread loss of confidence '' that threatens to shut down consumer lending , decimate the stock market , cause businesses and banks to fail -- and cost millions of Americans their jobs . 
`` Ultimately , our country could experience a long and painful recession , '' Bush said . 
`` Fellow citizens , we must not let this happen . '' 
Bush delivered the prime-time speech , his first in over a year , after a clamor on Capitol Hill for him to acknowledge the most serious financial crisis in decades and to personally make the case for the government intervention his administration has proposed . 
Five days after unveiling the bailout plan , which seeks to purchase troubled assets from faltering financial institutions , administration officials were still struggling to line up support among lawmakers appalled by its cost , doubtful of its methods and outraged by the speed with which they were being pushed to act . 
While the usually fractious Senate seemed to be coming together behind a version of the proposal , the administration had big trouble in the House , particularly among mistrustful Republicans who said the White House had failed to make a case for the bailout in terms ordinary people could understand . 
`` I 'm seeking answers to two fundamental questions : Why this ? 
And why now ? '' 
Rep. Deborah Pryce -LRB- R-Ohio -RRB- said before Bush delivered his remarks . 
`` You ca n't make a move this large without the approval of the American people . 
And we do n't have it , yet . '' 
Despite such skepticism , top members of the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees are slated to sit down this morning in an effort to draft the final details of a bipartisan bill . 
Bush also invited congressional leaders as well as presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama to meet with him at the White House today . 
The president 's top economic advisers were lobbying hard yesterday for passage of the bill . 
In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said the White House would drop its resistance to lawmakers ' demands for limits on executive compensation at companies that accept taxpayer money . 
Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
, the committee 's chairman , called that a `` big step forward '' and said he would push next year to apply those limits more broadly . 
Frank said Democrats in the House and Senate had reached agreement on a bill that would include an oversight board to monitor the bailout program , requirements that taxpayers share in future profits of companies that seek assistance and new powers for bankruptcy judges to modify home mortgages for distressed borrowers . 
Lawmakers also discussed doling out the money in segments , Frank said , adding , `` It 's not going to be a straight $ 700 billion . '' 
Democrats will present that bill this morning to Republican lawmakers in hopes of reaching a final agreement , Frank said . 
He said the biggest sticking points are likely to be the bankruptcy provision and a proposal by Senate Democrats to dedicate to affordable housing some of the proceeds from the eventual sale of the assets . 
Hours before Bush 's speech , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- 
and House Minority Leader John A. Boehner -LRB- R-Ohio -RRB- issued a joint statement saying they were `` working in a bipartisan manner '' and had `` made progress '' on a bill . 
But even as the substance of a deal began to take shape , the politics were in turmoil . 
McCain declared that he did `` not believe that the plan on the table will pass '' and announced he was leaving the campaign trail to return to Capitol Hill to lead negotiations , a move panned by Democrats as a political stunt . 
Meanwhile , with less than six weeks until the November election , Democratic leaders said they would approve the plan only if a majority of Republicans in both chambers endorsed it as well .

"Sarkozy Advocates Systemic Change After Crisis TOULON , France , Sept. 25 -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy warned Europe on Thursday that it can not escape shock waves from the U.S. financial crisis and that to protect its future , it must take the initiative in rewriting worldwide banking rules to end the `` folly '' of an under-regulated system he said is now `` finished . '' 
Sarkozy , who also holds the European Union 's rotating presidency , said he would propose swift action by the 27-nation bloc at its next meeting to tighten controls over European banks . 
But beyond Europe , he said , the leaders of all the world 's major industrial powers should gather at a special summit before the end of the year and start to construct from scratch a new financial and monetary framework to replace the U.S.-dominated system set up at Bretton Woods , N.H. , in 1944 . 
`` We can no longer manage the economy of the 21st century with the instruments of the economy of the 20th century , '' he declared . 
The U.S.-inspired lack of regulation in recent years , he added , `` was a folly whose price is being paid today . '' 
Sarkozy 's speech was described by aides as an attempt to reassure the French and other Europeans in the face of the sudden financial instability that threatens to aggravate an already bleak economic picture . 
In a recent survey by France 's IFOP polling agency , 83 percent of those queried said they believed the U.S. crisis will hurt French people by tightening credit and reducing growth even below the 1 percent forecast for 2008 . 
The hour-long address , to a receptive audience of political supporters in this Mediterranean seaport , also seemed designed to project Sarkozy as an innovator taking the initiative with fellow world leaders rather than submitting to a crisis that he said originated on Wall Street and unfurled across the Atlantic because of inadequate government regulation . 
Throughout his career , Sarkozy has sought to portray himself as a bold leader ready to take initiatives where others hesitate -- a trait his detractors have sometimes denounced as impetuosity or overreaching . 
`` My dear countrymen , amid these difficulties we must lead the march of the world and not follow it , '' he said . 
In decrying the lack of government regulation , Sarkozy joined a broad spectrum of European leaders and commentators who have interpreted the financial crisis as a death knell for the current financial markets and banking systems . 
Their comments sometimes have betrayed an `` I told you so '' sentiment , after years during which U.S. officials suggested that many of Europe 's economic problems stemmed from an excess of regulation and government intervention . 
French banks , in particular , have less to worry about than their U.S. counterparts , French officials have said , in part because regulatory powers are stronger in Europe than in the United States and the banks are less exposed to bad loans . 
The appropriate degree of state intervention in banking and financial dealings also has been a frequent subject of disagreement within the European Union . 
Those advocating more controls clearly have gained the upper hand for the time being . 
`` Self-regulation to solve all problems , it 's finished , '' Sarkozy said . 
`` Laissez-faire , it 's finished . 
The all-powerful market that is always right , it 's finished ... Self-regulation is sometimes insufficient . 
The market is sometimes wrong . 
Competition is sometimes ineffective or disloyal . 
It is necessary then for the state to intervene . '' 
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany , usually a stalwart ally of President Bush , also has derided the lack of regulation that , in her view , allowed the financial crisis to erupt in the United States and seep toward Europe . 
She and her deputies have repeatedly reminded the German public in recent days that the United States and Britain rejected her proposals last year for regulating international hedge funds and bond rating agencies . 
`` It was said for a long time , ` Let the markets take care of themselves , ' '' Merkel said during a visit to Austria on Saturday . 
Now , she added , `` even America and Britain are saying , ` Yes , we need more transparency , we need better standards . ' '' 
Germany 's finance minister , Peer Steinbrueck , said Thursday that the `` Anglo-Saxon '' capitalist system had run its course and that `` new rules of the road '' are needed , including greater global regulation of capital markets .

"Before moderator Jim Lehrer at the University of Mississippi , Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain sparred over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the fight against terrorism in Pakistan . 
-LRB- Pool Photo By Chip Somodevilla -RRB- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama greet each other before holding their first debate , at the University of Mississippi in Oxford . 
-LRB- By Linda Davidson -- The Washington Post -RRB- OXFORD , Miss. , Sept. 26 -- Sen. Barack Obama sharply criticized Sen. John McCain 's judgment on the war in Iraq , repeatedly telling his presidential rival `` you were wrong '' to rush the nation into battle , directly challenging the Republican nominee on foreign policy as the two met in their first debate of the general-election season . 
McCain aggressively pushed back , accusing Obama of failing to understand that a new approach employed by Gen. David H. Petraeus in Iraq would lead to victory and mocking him as naive for his willingness to meet with some of the world 's most brutal leaders . 
With 40 days remaining before Election Day and the U.S. economy teetering , the two clashed on taxes , energy policy , Russian aggression in Georgia and the threat posed by Iran . 
Neither made a serious mistake in an encounter that capped one of the most chaotic weeks of the campaign , nor was either able to claim a decisive victory . 
The debate itself almost did not happen . 
McCain 's dramatic midweek announcement that he was suspending his campaign to focus on the nation 's financial crisis left the face-off in limbo as both candidates rushed back to Washington on Thursday and plunged themselves into the acrimonious negotiations over a $ 700 billion economic bailout . 
On Friday , McCain reversed his pledge to stay in Washington until those negotiations concluded . 
And once on stage at the University of Mississippi , it was the exchanges about how to keep the United States safe that put the starkest differences between the two men on display . 
`` Senator Obama said the ` surge ' could not work , said it would increase sectarian violence , said it was doomed to failure , '' McCain said , focusing on recent improvements in conditions in Iraq . 
`` But yet , after conceding that , he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today . '' 
`` John , you like to pretend like the war started in 2007 , '' the senator from Illinois shot back . 
`` The war started in 2003 . '' 
In rapid-fire succession , Obama accused his rival of being in the wrong more than once as President Bush led the nation to war in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks . 
`` You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were . 
You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators . 
You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni . 
And you were wrong . '' 
Later , McCain 's voice dripped with derision as he questioned Obama 's statement that he would meet with the leaders of rogue foreign countries , including Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
`` So let me get this right : We sit down with Ahmadinejad , and he says , ` We 're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth , ' and we say , ` No , you 're not ' ? '' 
the senator from Arizona said , as Obama tried to object . 
Obama pushed back on McCain 's criticism , saying , `` I reserve the right , as president of the United States , to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it 's going to keep America safe . '' 
In response to the first question of the debate , Obama and McCain discarded the scheduled topic of foreign affairs and waded into a discussion of the nation 's financial crisis , with both saying they are optimistic that Congress will agree on a financial bailout plan in the coming days .

"The Financial Crisis and You Eve Applebaum and Scott Dominick wonder whether they should buy that perfect condo in Brooklyn . 
-LRB- Courtesty Of Eve Applebaum -RRB- When Cynthia Shank , 51 , looked at her individual retirement account summary last December , she had $ 448,000 . 
When she looked at it recently , she had $ 349,000 . 
`` I 'm afraid to look , '' she said . 
Shank , a Hagerstown resident , is not alone . 
More and more employers have stopped offering their employees pensions with fixed amounts and have instead moved them into defined-contribution plans that fluctuate with the stock market . 
Lately , there 's been a lot of fluctuating , and Americans are increasingly watching their retirement cushions lose much of their padding . 
Shank , who is single , is already stretching to meet her financial obligations . 
She has a mortgage , $ 9,000 in credit card debt and a $ 7,000 home-equity line of credit . 
Eventually , she will have student loans to pay off , as she is taking classes to get into library science , a career path that seems steadier than the one she is on now . 
She is a technical writer working on a $ 63,000 contract that may or may not be renewed next year . 
Even the cost of gasoline is taking a toll . 
She has a 50-mile round-trip commute each workday . 
`` That alone has been a killer , '' she said . 
As of last week , she had negative $ 25 in her checking account , which makes her wonder : How is she ever going to live comfortably in retirement when she ca n't even live comfortably with a full-time job ? 
And now , she has even less saved for retirement . 
Shank wrote to us seeking advice on rebuilding her retirement savings , or at least stopping it from dwindling away . 
Right now , she has it all in mutual funds , with about 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds . 
`` How should I reconfigure it now ? '' 
Should she move money into certificates of deposit , which tend to be safer ? 
But what is safe these days , she wonders . 
Money-market funds were considered safe until just a couple of weeks ago , when a major one foundered and the federal government had to promise to insure the rest . 
As for the money she has lost , `` Am I going to recover it ? '' 
Daniel P. Crimmins , founder and president of DPC Wealth Management in Ramsey , N.J. , urged her to remain calm . 
`` The timing of the stock market recovery is unknown , but investing in the equity markets requires a long-term perspective , '' he said . 
`` An asset allocation mix of 80 percent in equities requires this long-term perspective and would be acceptable at her age if this amount is truly for her retirement . '' 
That said , he did advise her to study her portfolio to make sure she has a diverse mix of stocks and bonds . 
`` Unless she had a sizeable amount in her IRA , a loss of $ 100,000 since December seems to be the result of a less-than-diversified portfolio , '' he said . 
Domenic DiPiero , president of Newport Capital Group in Red Bank , N.J. , said she might want to consider keeping 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds instead . 
As for the safety of bank CDs , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will cover $ 100,000 or less . 
Money-market funds owned before Sept. 19 of this year are now insured by the federal government for one year .

"A Government Hand In the Economy Is as Old as the Republic . 
It has become fashionable to fret that the current crisis on Wall Street marks the end of American capitalism as we know it . 
`` This massive bailout is not the solution , '' Sen. Jim Bunning -LRB- R-Ky . -RRB- 
`` It is financial socialism , and it is un-American . '' 
The near-collapse of the U.S. financial system and Washington 's sudden and massive intervention to try to shore it up certainly mark a major turning point , but a bailout would represent a thoroughly American next step for our economic system -- and one that will probably lead to better times . 
Americans may assume that the basics of capitalism have been firmly established here since time immemorial , but historical cataclysms such as the Great Depression strongly suggest otherwise . 
Simply put , capitalism evolves . 
And we need to understand its trajectory if we are to bring our economic system into greater accord with the other great source of American strength : the best principles of our democracy . 
No , our economy is not a shining example of pure unfettered market forces . 
It never has been . 
In his farewell address back in 1796 , 20 years after the publication of Adam Smith 's `` The Wealth of Nations , '' George Washington defined the new republic 's own distinctive national economic sensibility : `` Our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand ; neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences ; consulting the natural course of things ; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce , but forcing nothing . '' 
From the outset , Washington envisioned some government involvement in the commercial system , even as he recognized that commerce should belong to the people . 
Capitalism is not really the best word to describe this arrangement . 
-LRB- The term was coined in the late 19th century as a way to describe the ideological opposite of communism . -RRB- 
Some decades later , people began to use a better term , `` the American system , '' in which the government involved itself in the economy primarily to develop what we would now call infrastructure -- highways , canals , railroads -- but otherwise let economic liberty prevail . 
I prefer to call this spectacularly successful arrangement `` financial democracy '' -- a largely free system in which the U.S. government 's role is to help citizens achieve their best potential , using all the economic weapons that our financial arsenal can provide . 
So is the government 's bailout a major departure ? 
Today 's federal involvement offers bailouts as a strictly temporary measure to prevent a system-wide financial calamity . 
This is entirely in keeping with our basic principles -- as long as the bailout promotes , rather than hinders , financial democracy . 
Which , so far , it seems to . 
Congressional critics may be right to demand more help for homeowners and more accountability for Wall Street blunders , but the core idea of the plan is sound : to protect the financial infrastructure . 
Remember , Fannie Mae used to be a government entity , and by taking it over , the federal government is merely returning to the status quo ante . 
The measures to take toxic debts off the hands of financial and insurance firms are intended only to deal with a crisis , not to transform our financial system . 
The proposals do not represent any landmark change in the American way of prosperity . 
Everyone should take a deep breath . 
Changing our thinking about finance does not mean abolishing capitalism , but it does raise questions about what the changes mean . 
Whenever the public endures a crisis , ordinary citizens start to wonder how -- and whether -- our institutions really work . 
We no longer take things for granted . 
It is only then that real change becomes possible . 
So the current crisis got me thinking back to 1990 , the year before the collapse of the Soviet Union , when I worked with two Soviet economists , Maxim Boycko and Vladimir Korobov , to try to understand the different belief systems in their country and mine . 
We carried out identical surveys in Moscow and New York , comparing answers about fundamental notions of capitalism , and published our results in the American Economic Review . 
We expected to find that the Muscovites possessed scant understanding of how capitalism really works . 
But we found that they actually understood free-market dynamics better than the New Yorkers . 
We concluded that the Muscovites had proved more savvy precisely because their system was in crisis -- something that encouraged them to rethink their most fundamental notions . 
We Americans are going through a similar change right now . 
We no longer think that our financial future will be determined by securities brokers or inhumanly large investment banks . 
The most important question is not , `` What form should these temporary bailouts take ? '' 
It is , `` What are we really learning from all this ? '' 
We should be learning a great deal . 
The current crisis offers us a singular opportunity to reevaluate fundamentally the safety and permanence of the master financial institutions that we have come to take for granted as part of the national economic landscape . 
Over these past few turbulent weeks , we have learned that the monolithic investment banks are mortal : They are mostly gone , or absorbed by other banks . 
We have learned that what we called `` cash '' and considered perfectly safe is not necessarily so secure . 
So we are groping around for something else to trust . 
We should be open to thinking about a new set of financial arrangements -- a better financial democracy -- that can restore the public 's faith in the economic principles espoused by Washington more than two centuries ago . 
Here are some key features : 1 . 
Handle moral hazard better . 
The term `` moral hazard '' refers to the pernicious tendency some people have of failing deliberately if they think it 's advantageous to do so . 
Moral hazard is used to justify teaching people a lesson for their failures -- the same logic that once justified `` debtors ' prisons . '' 
-LRB- Yes , we really did have them . -RRB- 
But over the course of the 19th century , Americans grew more realistic about laying blame for economic catastrophes and started eyeing other parties besides the hapless and the bankrupt . 
The demise of the debtors ' prisons reflected Americans ' changing ideas about the meaning of a contract . 
By rescuing Wall Street tycoons who succumbed to the lure of an irrationally exuberant housing bubble , the bailouts today do pose something of a moral-hazard problem . 
But we can more than repair it by defining a new generation of financial contracts , with a continuation of our evolving thinking about moral hazard , reflecting greater enlightenment , greater understanding of human psychology and the means to deal with financial failure . 
For example , I have proposed replacing the conventional mortgage with what I call the `` continuous-workout mortgage '' -- one that would spell out in advance the conditions under which borrowers would see their debt reduced in a rocky economy . 
These conditions would be designed to minimize moral hazard : The borrowers would not be able to make the debt reduction happen deliberately . 
To limit risks to the system , build better derivatives . 
Some of today 's derivatives -- the complex bundles of toxic real estate loans that helped drag Lehman Brothers down -- turned out to be `` financial weapons of mass destruction , '' as the legendary investor Warren E. Buffett warned back in 2003 . 
The problem is n't derivatives per se but a certain kind -- derivatives that spun a massive web of over-the-counter contracts , relying on the solvency of countless banks and other institutions , and ultimately endangered the entire financial system when they fell apart . 
Some kinds of derivatives , such as those maintained by futures exchanges using procedures that effectively eliminate the risk that the other party in the agreement will default , are more useful -- and far safer -- than others . 
It is high time to redesign derivatives to avoid what Buffett called `` mega-catastrophic '' risks . 
Trust markets , not Wall Street titans . 
If institutions can be said to have charisma , such giants as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch certainly had it in spades . 
But these firms proved not to be the sole source of financial intelligence . 
They were merely meeting places for smart , financially savvy people -- and for some reckless folks besides . 
We need to learn to trust people and markets rather than institutions . 
This means developing better markets that will allow us to hedge against the kinds of risks that dragged us into this crisis , such as real estate gambles . 
Maybe next time , we will listen more closely to financial theorists who think in abstract , general terms . 
Consider the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998 , when the Federal Reserve leaned on financial titans to rescue a massive hedge fund and stave off global fallout . 
Lots of people hold that the moral of the LCTM story was the failed thinking of two of the firm 's founders , Robert Merton and Myron Scholes , both of whom were Nobel Prize-winning financial theorists . 
In fact , the collapse of LTCM was largely due to the overconfidence of bond trader John Meriwether and some of his other LTCM colleagues , who were gambling in the markets . 
The disgraced Merton has been working for the last decade trying to build better risk-management systems , mostly to little avail . 
Maybe he will be heard now . 
People still seem to want to trust businessmen who have made bundles and have a huge investment bank behind them , rather than listen to experts who are thinking about the fundamentals of risk management . 
We would have been better off this month if we 'd been ignoring the former and listening to the latter . 
These and other improvements in the contemporary economy -- a better financial information infrastructure -LRB- so that people can gauge risks better -RRB- , broader markets -LRB- so that people can manage big risks , such as real estate loans -RRB- and better retail products -LRB- such as continuous-workout mortgages -RRB- -- will need to be discussed , debated and delivered in the days ahead . 
If we move smartly , Americans can have a better , more robust financial democracy along the lines of the system envisioned by our first president . 
The current crisis does not mean the end of American capitalism . 
But if we are lucky , it will mean an important step in its evolution . 
"
"What we are witnessing , in the broadest sense , is the bankruptcy of modern economics . 
Its conceit has been that we had solved the problem of stability . 
Oh , there would be periodic recessions , but the prospects of a major economic collapse were negligible because we knew how the system worked and could take steps to prevent it . 
What 's been so unsettling about the present crisis is that it has not conformed to the standard model of business cycles and has not submitted to familiar textbook solutions . 
A hallmark of the crisis has been the stark contrast between the `` real economy '' of production and jobs and the tumultuous financial markets of stocks , bonds , banks , money funds and the like . 
Even with the 60 percent drop in housing construction since early 2006 , the real economy has so far suffered only modest setbacks . 
Yes , there are 605,000 fewer payroll jobs than there were in December ; still , 137.5 million jobs remain . 
Meanwhile , financial markets verge on hysteria . 
The question is whether this hysteria will drive the real economy into a deep recession or worse -- and what we can do to prevent that . 
The word that best epitomizes mainstream `` macroeconomics '' -LRB- the study of the entire economy , not individual markets -RRB- is demand . 
If weak demand left the economy in a slump , government could rectify the situation by stimulating more demand through tax cuts , higher spending or lower interest rates . 
If excess demand created inflation , government could suppress it by cutting demand through more taxes , less spending or higher interest rates . 
Economists of this tradition watch consumer and business behavior . 
Are car sales soft ? 
How much are companies raising prices ? 
The $ 152 billion `` stimulus '' program earlier this year was a classic exercise in `` demand management . '' 
It did n't work well mainly because this crisis originated in frightened financial markets . 
Massive losses on mortgage-related securities caused some financial institutions to fail . 
As fear spread , financial institutions grew wary of dealing with each other because no one knew who was solvent and who was n't . 
To Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , this financial breakdown now threatens the real economy . 
Companies depend on bank borrowings and sales of commercial paper -LRB- in effect , short-term bonds -RRB- to conduct everyday business -- to buy inventories , to pay suppliers and workers before cash arrives from sales . 
Credit markets were freezing , Paulson and Bernanke decided . 
Panicky investors were shifting from commercial paper to Treasury bills ; banks were n't lending to each other . 
If it continued , consumers and firms would n't get essential credit . 
If you reject that conclusion , then the whole crisis has been a contrived farce . 
Some economists do ; they note that downturns always involve losses and disruptions . 
This one is n't so different . 
But many economists agree with Paulson and Bernanke . 
`` If we ca n't calm down short-term credit markets , we 're looking at a pretty severe recession , '' says Michael Mussa of the Peterson Institute for International Economics . 
`` If businesses ca n't roll over their short-term debt , -LRB- they -RRB- ask where can we cut back '' -- firing workers , reducing spending -- `` to avoid bankruptcy . '' 
Unfortunately , we lack experience with stabilizing financial markets , and the issue has been at the fringes of economics . 
Mostly , markets should operate freely . 
When is intervention justified ? 
Of course , economists recognized that the Federal Reserve should act as a `` lender of last resort '' and that permitting two-fifths of banks to fail in the 1930s aggravated the Depression . 
But the creation in 1933 of deposit insurance -LRB- now up to $ 100,000 -RRB- was thought to prevent most bank runs , and the `` lender of last resort '' role never anticipated a worldwide financial system that mediated credit not just through banks but also through hedge funds , private equity funds , investment banks and many other channels . 
In congressional testimony last week , Bernanke admitted the Fed has been `` shocked '' at how elastic the `` lender of last resort '' role has become . 
The resulting intellectual vacuum has spawned political chaos . 
Unpleasant and untested ideas invite opposition . 
Paulson 's plan to buy up to $ 700 billion of impaired securities is wildly unpopular . 
It may not work and raises many problems . 
If the government pays too little for the securities , financial failures may mount ; if it pays too much , it may create windfall profits for some investors and losses for taxpayers . 
But Paulson 's plan has better prospects for restoring confidence by removing suspect securities from balance sheets than suggested alternatives would . 
Selective injections of capital into banks , for instance , might involve favoritism and operate too slowly to improve confidence . 
The economy will get worse . 
Mussa thinks unemployment -LRB- now 6.1 percent -RRB- could peak near 7 percent ; other projections are higher . 
The harder question is whether financial turmoil heralds an era of instability . 
Our leaders are making up their responses from day to day because old ideas of how the economy works have failed them . 
These ideas were not necessarily wrong , but they 're grievously inadequate at the moment . 
"
"A bipartisan rebellion in the House killed a $ 700 billion rescue plan for the nation 's financial system yesterday , sending global stock prices plunging , prompting fierce recriminations on the presidential campaign trail and dealing President Bush his worst legislative defeat . 
House Democratic and Republican leaders vowed to go back into negotiations to devise compromise legislation to stabilize the credit markets , but no talks were scheduled . 
After U.S. financial markets closed , with the Dow Jones industrial average down a one-day record of 778 points , or 7 percent , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. tried to calm frazzled traders , assuring them that work on a market intervention would resume . 
`` I will continue to work with congressional leaders to find a way forward to pass a comprehensive plan to stabilize our financial system and protect the American people by limiting the prospects of further deterioration in our economy , '' he said . 
`` We 've got much work to do , and this is much too important to simply let fail . '' 
Rarely has a congressional vote held such high drama and produced such immediate repercussions , directly from the House floor to the trading floor . 
Wall Street traders huddling around television screens watched lawmakers denounce the bailout legislation , and then sent the Dow plummeting . 
Stocks had recovered somewhat by the time the vote was gaveled to a close , but jittery investors sent them plunging again as Republicans and Democrats took turns blaming each other for the defeat . 
In a few hours , $ 1.2 trillion in paper wealth was wiped out . 
As lawmakers in Congress pointed fingers , the collapse of the world 's financial markets only built steam . 
Brazil 's main stock index lost more than 9 percent on the news of the U.S. congressional vote , and fears spread that other emerging markets could feel the credit crunch . 
European bourses fell earlier in the day as a result of the financial struggles of major European banks , and regulators from Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg moved to rescue the European banking and insurance giant Fortis . 
And Citigroup stepped in to buy Wachovia 's banking operations for $ 2.16 billion , making it the dominant bank in the Washington area . 
On the 228 to 205 congressional vote , 140 Democrats voted yes and 95 voted no ; 133 Republicans opposed the measure , while 65 approved . 
`` The Democratic side more than lived up to its side of the bargain , '' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- . 
House Minority Whip Roy Blunt -LRB- R-Mo . -RRB- 
said of the Democrats : `` We 're going to reach back out to them . 
We 're going to be talking to our members and see how we can come together in the next few days to reverse whatever negative impact there may be in the economy over the next few days because Congress has failed to act . '' 
Yesterday , Bush called nearly every member of Texas 's Republican delegation , GOP aides said . 
He won over four of the 19 . 
Congressional leaders and the White House faced several options , none of them palatable just weeks before a heavily contested presidential election . 
Democratic leaders could choose to return with a measure guaranteed to win more Democratic votes , even at the expense of Republican support . 
Instead of simply purchasing distressed assets from financial institutions , some Democratic economists favor injecting lenders with cash in exchange for stock , letting the institutions figure out what to do with the mortgage-backed securities and other troubled assets weighing down their books . 
A Democratic bill would also include more money for homeowners in or facing foreclosure and would change the bankruptcy law to allow judges to adjust mortgage repayment terms . 
But Democratic leaders would have to ensure that the measure could survive a filibuster in the Senate and would be signed by the president . 
Republicans were advocating slight changes to the bill that could attract a handful of new votes . 
Party members might be enticed by a measure that would allow businesses to write off more past losses on this year 's taxes or a more robust expansion of mortgage insurance , financed by banks . 
Democrats could add more assistance to ailing state and local governments without raising too many GOP objections . 
"
"The sale of Wachovia 's banking business to Citigroup yesterday marked the second time in five days that a major U.S. bank was forced from existence in part by fleeing depositors , raising serious questions about the stability of other financial firms and the health of the banking system . 
The deal also continues the rapid consolidation of an industry that has long been kept fragmented as a matter of public policy but now is being encouraged by the government to conglomerate . 
In the latest rescue urged by federal regulators , Citigroup agreed to pay $ 2.16 billion for Wachovia , the nation 's third-largest retail and commercial banking franchise . 
Wachovia was fast-growing and widely admired , run by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. 's former deputy Robert Steel . 
Citigroup is a long-standing colossus of the American financial services industry . 
Citigroup , based in New York , would become the largest bank in the Washington area . 
The deal would protect all deposits at Wachovia , according to a statement from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which presided over the companies ' shotgun wedding . 
To consummate the deal , the FDIC promised to limit Citigroup 's losses on a $ 312 billion portfolio of Wachovia 's most troubled loans . 
The government agreed to absorb all losses beyond $ 42 billion , a threshold that could be exceeded based on the performance of similar groups of mortgage loans at other banks . 
In exchange , the government would get a $ 12 billion stake in Citigroup , making it one of the largest shareholders in what would be the nation 's largest bank . 
Sheila C. Bair , chairman of the FDIC , said the government 's involvement was necessary `` to maintain confidence in the banking industry given current financial-market conditions . '' 
Citigroup will join Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase in a small group of giants that have emerged from the crisis to dominate American banking . 
The three companies together would hold more than 30 percent of the nation 's deposits . 
They would hold more than 40 percent of bank loans to corporations . 
They would be the issuers of more than 50 percent of the nation 's credit cards . 
And they would each number among the five largest investment banks . 
The banking industry was fragmented by the government during the Great Depression and kept that way for most of a century , to promote competition , reduce prices and keep any one company from becoming too central to the health of the economy . 
Now those efforts have been upturned in the space of a frantic month . 
Federal regulators said that they encouraged the consolidation because the alternative was a systemic collapse and that they will consider the ramifications once the crisis is resolved . 
Critics , however , said that regulators , in attempting to fix the banking system , are repeating the same mistakes they made in allowing the crisis to spin out of control : They are ignoring the long-term interests of consumers and of the economy . 
`` I think we 've learned in this crisis that there 's a connection between making sure that customers are not abused and ensuring that banks can continue to earn profits , '' said John Taylor , chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition , a consumer advocacy group . 
`` Ignoring those consumer protections is what got us into trouble in the first place . '' 
Some analysts also question how the government will regulate companies with which it is increasingly intertwined . 
The government has helped to decide which banks will acquire fallen rivals . 
It has backstopped some of those deals with federal money , and it now owns a stake in Citigroup .

"Tuesday , September 30 , 2008 ; 10:10 AM Most Americans see the current financial situation as a `` crisis , '' and there is overwhelming concern that the failure of the House of Representatives to pass the economic recovery package will deepen the problem , according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll . 
But the poll also revealed significant public concern with the bill Congress rejected yesterday , as few voters said the package did enough to protect `` ordinary Americans , '' and nearly half said it did not go far enough to shore up the nation 's economy . 
Nevertheless , nearly nine in 10 expressed concern that the failure of the bill could lead to a more severe economic decline , including a slim majority calling themselves `` very worried . '' 
High levels of concern cross party lines , but Democrats and Republicans have contrasting views of the urgency of the situation . 
In the poll , 60 percent of Democrats call the economic woes a crisis , compared with 44 percent of Republicans . 
Overall , voters split about evenly on the failed bill -- 45 percent supported it , 47 percent opposed it . 
Among the reasons for the tepid public reception is that there is a roughly even divide about whether government efforts will prevent the financial situation from deteriorating further still . 
And on the particulars , about as many voters said the plan rejected by Congress did `` too much '' to help major financial institutions that got into trouble as said that the bill did `` too little . '' 
Nearly half said the failed plan did not do enough to help the broader economy , and more , 61 percent said there was insufficient assistance for the general public . 
That the bill did not go far enough to aid the public is a view shared by Democrats -LRB- 69 percent -RRB- , independents -LRB- 59 percent -RRB- and Republicans -LRB- 50 percent -RRB- alike . 
Asked to assess responsibility for the legislation 's failure , 44 percent said Republicans were the reason , 21 percent said the Democrats and 17 percent said both sides were responsible . 
On the broader economic problems facing the country , voters spread the blame . 
In an open-ended question , a quarter of all voters said George W. Bush is responsible for the economy 's relatively poor performance , more than any other single cause . 
About a quarter name Congress -LRB- 8 percent -RRB- , the federal government -LRB- 8 percent -RRB- and Democrats and Republicans -LRB- 5 percent each -RRB- together . 
Eighteen percent said Wall Street financial institutions and banks shoulder responsibility , 7 percent blame `` everyone '' and 5 percent highlighted the role of individuals who borrowed too much . 
Partisan filters dominate on this question : Nearly half of all Democrats blame Bush ; that is just 4 percent among Republicans . 
Moreover , no Democrats blamed `` Democrats '' generally ; no Republicans singled out `` Republicans . '' 
Despite the negative assessment of the current financial situation , four in 10 remain optimistic about the state of the national economy over the next year and six in 10 are bullish about their family 's financial situation . 
But pessimism about personal finances has climbed over the past two years and now stands at more than double its level in December 2006 . 
The poll was conducted by telephone yesterday among a random sample of 520 adults and 424 registered voters . 
The margin of sampling error among registered voters is plus or minus five percentage points .

"Probe Into Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac Widens District-based Fannie Mae said it `` intends to cooperate fully . '' 
-LRB- By Jay Mallin -- Bloomberg News -RRB- The government probe into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac widened as the mortgage giants disclosed yesterday they are under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission . 
The companies , which received letters from authorities on Friday informing them of the probes , did not identify the documents investigators are seeking . 
District-based Fannie Mae said it `` intends to cooperate fully with these investigations and inquiries . '' 
McLean-based Freddie Mac said it `` will cooperate fully in these matters . '' 
The SEC 's investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is `` likely a pretty broad scope of review to see if they can find any evidence or allegations of misconduct by the executives , '' said Bryan J. Sillaman , who worked on a prior accounting probe of Fannie Mae as a lawyer in the enforcement division of the SEC . 
`` At this point , it 's probably not focused too much , and they 're probably going to request a rather broad set of documents to see what executives may have known about the valuation of certain securities , and whether that 's consistent with what they were disclosing to the public . '' 
The probes come as the government is investigating a wide range of financial firms involved in the financial crisis . 
The FBI has also launched investigations into American International Group and Lehman Brothers . 
In all , the FBI is looking at 26 companies . 
In addition , the SEC has opened 50 probes into disclosure issues , stock sales by corporate insiders and the way housing-related investments were valued at banks , insurers and credit ratings agencies . 
No major conviction has been obtained related to the financial crisis . 
A number of mortgage companies have agreed to multimillion-dollar settlements with authorities over bad lending practices , and two investment managers associated with Bear Stearns hedge funds that collapsed in the summer of 2007 have been arrested . 
In an agreement with the SEC and the New York attorney general , Wall Street firms have agreed to buy back billions in complex securities from investors . 
Neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac commented yesterday beyond the statements . 
The SEC and U.S. attorney 's office also declined to comment . 
Before the mortgage crisis , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines related to their role in a pair of unrelated accounting scandals . 
The companies were just emerging from the cloud of those troubles when home prices began to fall and bad debts mounted , causing billions in losses that led in part to the government 's takeover . 
As the crisis unfolded , analysts and journalists publicly questioned some of the firms ' accounting decisions ; there is no evidence that these questions factored into the government investigations . 
One question concerned a change in the way Fannie Mae disclosed information about foreclosures . 
Company executives said they were trying to be more transparent ; an online report in Fortune magazine and some analysts suggested the changes might mean the company would face much higher losses . 
When the reports surfaced last November , the news sent the company 's shares diving . 
But the concern was short-lived and was not featured prominently among later discussions . 
More recently , analysts and the press questioned how the companies calculated their capital -- a government-mandated financial cushion used to offset losses . 
For most of the year , the companies -- and their regulator -- said the companies had sufficient capital . 
In the weeks leading up to the takeover , government examiners looking through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's books worried about what made up the capital the companies were claiming . 
For instance , they counted as part of their capital certain tax credits they were due . 
But the tax credits could only be applied against profits . 
Since the companies were experiencing big losses , the tax credits had little immediate value . '' 
"
"That is the technical economic term that best sums up a day in which the House of Representatives refuses to pass a $ 700 billion rescue plan pushed by the White House and congressional leaders from both parties , Wachovia is taken over in a deal that will have the government potentially owning 10 percent of Citigroup , a few European banks fail , the Federal Reserve and other central banks are forced to inject an additional $ 300 billion into the global banking system , the Dow Jones industrial average plunges 778 points , and investors everywhere rush to the safety of gold and short-term Treasury bills . 
The basic problem here is that too many people do n't understand the seriousness of the situation . 
Americans fail to understand that they are facing the real prospect of a decade of little or no economic growth because of the bursting of a credit bubble that they helped create and that now threatens to bring down the global financial system . 
Politicians worry less about preventing a financial meltdown than about ideology , partisan posturing and teaching people a lesson . 
Financiers have yet to own up publicly to their own greed , arrogance and incompetence . 
And leaders of foreign governments still think that this is an American problem and that they have no need to mount similar rescue efforts in their own countries . 
In the coming weeks and months , all of these people will come to understand how deep the hole really is and how we 're all in it together . 
They 'll come to understand that the giant sucking sound they hear is of a massive deleveraging of the global economy and the global financial system as households , governments , businesses and investment funds adjust to living in a world with less debt and more inflation . 
And they will come around , reluctantly , to the understanding that the only way to get out of these situations is to have governments all around the world borrow gobs of money and effectively nationalize large swaths of the financial system so it can be restructured , recapitalized , reformed and returned to private ownership once the crisis has passed and the economy has gotten back on its feet . 
In the next few weeks , the center of attention here in the United States will shift from the Congress and an exhausted Treasury to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which will now have to rescue any number of failing banks , either by taking them over directly or managing their transfer into stronger hands . 
It will also shift back to the Federal Reserve and other central banks , which will have to step up their efforts to maintain liquidity in money markets and prevent the credit crunch from taking down hedge funds , businesses , and state and local governments . 
These will , alas , be only holding actions . 
Restoring real stability to financial markets will require the kind of systemic approach and extraordinary government interventions that the public has refused to authorize and finance . 
In better times , the public might have put aside its reluctance in response to the strong and unified recommendation of political and business leaders . 
But it is a measure of how little trust remains in both Washington and Wall Street that voters are willing to risk a serious hit to their wealth and income rather than follow their lead .

"The theory underlying the bailout plan stalled in Congress is that rescuing the finance industry will restore market stability and that the benefits will eventually trickle down to average Americans . 
Thus , solving the subprime mortgage crisis has morphed into a much larger challenge : reassembling the architecture of the financial markets , which seemingly requires giving the Treasury secretary nearly a trillion dollars and extraordinary latitude to pick winners and losers . 
There is an easier and more politically palatable fix : Pay off all the delinquent mortgages . 
The financial crisis is a liquidity crisis , yes , but it is ultimately a product of homeowner failures to pay . 
Unless this fundamental problem is fixed , we will continue to see -- and need to treat -- the symptoms . 
The proposed bailout ignores this . 
Yet the sum being demanded from taxpayers is almost certainly more than sufficient to pay off all currently delinquent mortgages . 
If the government did this , all the complex derivatives based on these mortgages would be as good as U.S. Treasuries . 
Their fair value would jump to 100 cents on the dollar , rescuing teetering financial institutions . 
The credit markets would be resuscitated overnight . 
Some will argue that it is grossly unfair to pay off the mortgages of borrowers who took risks and lost . 
In other words , why should my profligate neighbor be rewarded for overleveraging himself ? 
Because such unfairness is a small price to pay to avoid a rapid transition to a socialist economy , the collapse of our financial system -LRB- and its related global implications -RRB- and a frightening shift of economic power toward the executive branch . 
Why shell out $ 700 billion to Wall Street dealmakers and the companies they managed into this mess ? 
Would n't it be preferable for individual homeowners to benefit directly ? 
Implementation could follow the example of the Home Owners ' Loan Corp. , which in the 1930s issued new mortgages to a quarter of American homeowners . 
The government could offer to refinance all mortgages issued in the past five years with a fixed-rate , 30-year mortgage at 6 percent . 
No credit scores , no questions asked ; just pay off the principal of the existing mortgage with a government check . 
If monthly payments are still too high , homeowners could reduce their indebtedness in exchange for a share of the future price appreciation of the house . 
That is , the government would take an ownership interest in the house just as it would take an ownership interest in the financial institutions that would be bailed out under the Treasury 's plan . 
All this could be done through the Federal Housing Administration , with the help of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which have the infrastructure to implement this plan rapidly . 
An equity participation structure would prevent thousands of foreclosed homes from being dumped on a strained housing market and would allow prices to reach a new equilibrium that is based on realistic demand for houses rather than on easy money or impending foreclosures . 
Like the administration 's proposal , this plan would result in the government owning assets . 
But these assets would be real estate , not complex derivatives whose true value would take weeks to discern . 
Homeowners would become partners with the government in resolving the crisis . 
When Congress returns , lawmakers are likely to modify and then pass the administration 's bailout proposal . 
They should consider ways to implement this bottom-up solution . 
Combining this approach with the government 's proposal could greatly benefit taxpayers . 
Yes , the government 's swift purchase of illiquid securities would stabilize compromised financial institutions and the credit markets . 
But the notion that taxpayers would benefit in the long run is pure speculation , particularly if the government overpaid for the securities . 
On the other hand , once a government-sponsored refinancing wave kicked in , the full value of the securities in the government 's portfolio would be restored , and they could be sold off in an orderly manner , with Uncle Sam taking profits that would cover the cost of the bailout . 
The public is rightly concerned that the administration 's bailout would benefit only powerful financial institutions . 
No matter how it 's done , rescuing the financial system is a large , complex gamble . 
This solution would start by helping ordinary Americans and would quickly spill over to revive the financial markets . 
Directly addressing the underlying cause of the crisis would help ensure that we would not be facing the same crisis again down the road . 
While Wall Street has only recently felt the bite of foreclosures and delinquencies , communities across the nation will face greater financial and social fallout if the foreclosure crisis continues .

"'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | Talk + | DUBAI : A sea port of the United Arab Emirates , Dubai is the scene of a $ 60 billion building frenzy . 
Here , a Pakistani worker passes in front of the Burj Dubai tower , the world 's tallest free-standing structure . 
-LRB- By Kamran Jebreili -- Associated Press -RRB- SHANGHAI : At 101 stories , the World Financial Center is China 's tallest building and a symbol of the country 's go-go economy . 
-LRB- By Eugene Hoshiko -- Associated Press -RRB- SHANGHAI -- Looking down from his building 's 87th floor at the glittering signs of multinational banks along the river here , Fan Dizhao declared confidently that Wall Street 's reign as the world 's No. 1 financial hub is coming to an end . 
The United States may be grappling with its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , but these are go-go days in China . 
Venture capital , private equity and foreign direct investment are at all-time highs . 
Although Shanghai 's stock exchange has lost close to two-thirds of its value this year , China 's big banks have escaped the credit catastrophe largely unscathed , and the economy continues to expand briskly . 
Fan , an investment manager at Guotai Asset Management , which oversees funds valued at about $ 5.1 billion , said that despite the country 's inexperience in the financial sector , China has a rare trump card : mountains of cash . 
`` It is inevitable , '' he said , `` that we will take the U.S. 's place as the world leader . '' 
But Shanghai is just one of several cities harboring ambitious -- and to some analysts , fanciful -- aspirations while the global finance industry is reshuffled . 
Tokyo has lifted some regulations on banks and insurance groups and has begun to do something it resisted for a long time : print securities documents in English . 
The Singapore government , which through its massive sovereign wealth funds has increased its private equity and other financial holdings in recent years , has said it is looking to invest in more distressed assets in the United States . 
And Dubai , riding the Middle East 's oil-fired boom , has declared itself the center of Islamic finance and says it aims , in the words of Dubai 's government , to `` develop the same stature as New York . '' 
With U.S. investment houses tumbling into bankruptcy , consolidating operations or transforming themselves into more closely regulated commercial banks , Wall Street 's reputation as the prime address to raise capital , seek investment advice or trade securities is no longer rock-solid . 
The flow of capital had already begun moving away from the United States this summer . 
A survey released last week about the competitiveness of world financial centers found that New York and London , often neck-and-neck in such rankings , were still at the top . 
But the survey also found that the two cities ' lead over their rivals shrank after February because of the credit crisis and the collapse of U.S. securities firms . 
Frankfurt , Germany , and Paris also lost ground . 
Cities in Asia and the Middle East , meanwhile , were deemed most likely to gain in importance . 
`` Dubai , Singapore , Shanghai and Mumbai -- they are the probable leaders , '' said Michael Mainelli , executive chairman of Z\/Yen group , which carried out the survey . 
Researchers looked at factors including infrastructure , foreign direct investment , cost of living and the presence of a fair and just business environment .

"We are , just now , stuck between eras . 
The old order -- the Reagan-age institutions built on the premise that the market can do no wrong and the government no right -- is dying . 
A new order , in which Wall Street plays a diminished role and Washington a larger one , is aborning , but the process is painful and protracted . 
It shuddered to a halt on Monday , when House Republicans , by 2 to 1 , declined to support the administration 's bailout plan . 
To lay the blame on Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's speech -LRB- in which she even noted the work of House GOP leaders in crafting the compromise -RRB- is to miss the larger picture : The proposal asked Republicans to acknowledge the failure of the market and the capacity of government to set things right . 
It asked them to repudiate their worldview , to go against the beliefs that impelled many of them to enter politics in the first place . 
So as America experienced a financial crisis , House Republicans experienced a crisis of faith . 
And on Monday , most of them opted to stick to their faith , whatever the financial consequences for the nation . 
Many of the Republicans ' counterproposals to the bailout bill were so wide of the mark that they can be understood only as faith-based solutions to empirical problems . 
Banks and investment houses are toppling like so many dominos , and , to solve this crisis of capital evaporation , House Republicans suggested reducing the capital gains tax . 
Are we to believe that more investors did n't rush to rescue LehmanBearAIGWaMuWachoviaEtc because they calculated that the tax on the capital gains they 'd realize was too high ? 
Then again , the bill that the Republicans opposed was itself a transitional document -- to some extent ushering in a new order , though designed chiefly to prop up the old . 
The bailout plan 's political travails can be traced to its conception -- a three-page proposal for the Treasury secretary , who is the immediate past CEO of Wall Street 's most successful investment bank , to buy up financial institutions ' bad loans at prices he would set , with no oversight and no aid to anybody else . 
The bill that went to the House floor Monday had been significantly improved : It created the possibility that the public would gain a limited equity interest in some banks in return for the public 's largess ; it restricted Wall Street CEO pay ; it allowed for a stock-transaction tax to cover any public losses if such still existed after five years . 
But it had been stamped at birth as a bailout for Wall Street , by a Treasury Department that did n't see the glaringly obvious political problems that created . 
It 's possible that with a few cosmetic changes , the bill can be passed by the House tomorrow . 
Or it may be that the prospect of bailing out Wall Street with public funds offends so many House members at both ends of the political spectrum that it goes down to defeat again . 
If that happens , the next move would be for Democrats to craft a solution more in the spirit of FDR : Save American capitalism by fundamentally reshaping it . 
They could direct the government to raise the amount of depositors ' money it insures , to compel the banks to write down their losses , to recapitalize the banks by taking a significant equity interest in them , and to refinance beleaguered homeowners directly . 
Already , it 's clear that we will emerge from this crisis with fewer but bigger banks . 
As a result of the recent government-arranged consolidations and fire sales , three banks -- JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America and Citigroup -- will control roughly one-third of all deposits . 
They will be too big to fail . 
They will also be so big that they 'll be able to set the price for money when Americans come borrowing . 
As such , they will require tighter regulation than we 've imposed on banks before . 
And that 's hardly the only arena in which government will have to do more . 
With financial institutions de-leveraging and lending less , it will fall upon the government to invest more in the American economy -- to diminish the effects of the recession that is coming down the tracks and to build the kind of infrastructure that will enhance American competitiveness in a global economy . 
It 's not just investment banks that have fallen by the wayside in the recent carnage ; it 's the ideology of unregulated capitalism -- of Reaganism . 
And if Republicans can not find a way to disenthrall themselves from their faith in their old gods , they may ensure that the GOP itself becomes one more casualty in the collapse of laissez faire . 
"
"Crooked mortgage brokers , greedy investment bankers , oblivious rating agencies and gullible investors have all been faulted in the financial crisis , and there is bipartisan agreement that regulators were asleep at the switch . 
It 's all well and good to call for substantial new oversight . 
But if regulators were oblivious to the danger , the question is why . 
In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the answer seems easy : Their massive lobbying machines thwarted every legislative attempt at reform . 
But what about the Fed , the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission , agencies that are not above politics but are known for their professionalism and expertise ? 
Surely they had the capability and motivation to avoid a calamity of the type that is occurring . 
Why did they fail ? 
The problem is that Wall Street and regulators relied on complex mathematical models that told financial institutions how much risk they were taking at any given time . 
Since the 1990s , risk management on Wall Street has been dominated by a model called `` value at risk '' -LRB- VaR -RRB- . 
VaR attributes risk factors to every security and aggregates these factors across an entire portfolio , identifying those risks that cancel out . 
What 's left is `` net '' risk that is then considered in light of historical patterns . 
The model predicts with 99 percent probability that institutions can not lose more than a certain amount of money . 
Institutions compare this `` worst case '' with their actual capital and , if the amount of capital is greater , sleep soundly at night . 
Regulators , knowing that the institutions used these models , also slept soundly . 
As long as capital was greater than the value at risk , institutions were considered sound -- and there was no need for hands-on regulation . 
Lurking behind the models , however , was a colossal conceptual error : the belief that risk is randomly distributed and that each event has no bearing on the next event in a sequence . 
This is typically explained with a coin-toss analogy . 
If you flip a coin and get `` heads '' and then do it again , the first heads has no bearing on whether the second toss will be heads or tails . 
It 's a common fallacy that if you get three heads in a row , there 's a better-than-even chance that the next toss will be tails . 
That 's simply not true . 
Each toss has a 50-50 chance of being heads or tails . 
Such systems are represented in the bell curve , which makes clear that events of the type we have witnessed lately are so statistically improbable as to be practically impossible . 
This is why markets are taken by surprise when they occur . 
But what if markets are not like coin tosses ? 
What if risk is not shaped like a bell curve ? 
What if new events are profoundly affected by what went before ? 
Both natural and man-made systems are full of the kind of complexity in which minute changes at the start result in divergent and unpredictable outcomes . 
These systems are sometimes referred to as `` chaotic , '' but that 's a misnomer ; chaos theory permits an understanding of dynamic processes . 
Chaotic systems can be steered toward more regular behavior by affecting a small number of variables . 
But beyond chaos lies complexity that truly is unpredictable and can not be modeled with even the most powerful computers . 
Capital markets are an example of such complex dynamic systems . 
Think of a mountainside full of snow . 
A snowflake falls , an avalanche begins and a village is buried . 
What caused the catastrophe ? 
The value-at-risk crowd focuses on each snowflake and resulting cause and effect . 
The complexity theorist studies the mountain . 
The arrangement of snow is a good example of a highly complex set of interdependent relationships ; so complex it is impossible to model . 
If one snowflake did not set off the avalanche , the next one could , or the one after that . 
But it 's not about the snowflakes ; it 's about the instability of the system . 
This is why ski patrols throw dynamite down the slopes each day before skiers arrive . 
They are `` regulating '' the system so that it does not become unstable . 
The more enlightened among the value-at-risk practitioners understand that extreme events occur more frequently than their models predict . 
So they embellish their models with `` fat tails '' -LRB- upward bends on the wings of the bell curve -RRB- and model these tails on historical extremes such as the post-Sept . 
But complex systems are not confined to historical experience . 
Events of any size are possible , and limited only by the scale of the system itself . 
Since we have scaled the system to unprecedented size , we should expect catastrophes of unprecedented size as well . 
We 're in the middle of one such catastrophe , and complexity theory says it will get much worse . 
Financial systems overall have emergent properties that are not conspicuous in their individual components and that traditional risk management does not account for . 
When it comes to the markets , the aggregate risk is far greater than the sum of the individual risks ; this is something that Long-Term Capital Management did not understand in the 1990s and that Wall Street seems not to comprehend now . 
As long as Wall Street and regulators keep using the wrong paradigm , there 's no hope they will appreciate just how bad things can become . 
And the new paradigm of risk must be understood if we are to avoid lurching from one bank failure to the next .

"Krauthammer 's Hail Mary Rule : You get only two per game . 
John McCain , unfortunately , has already thrown three . 
The first was his bet on the surge , a deep pass to David Petraeus who miraculously ran it all the way into the end zone . 
Then , seeking a game-changer after the Democratic convention , McCain threw blind into the end zone to a waiting Sarah Palin . 
She caught the ball . 
Her subsequent fumbles have taken the sheen off of that play , but she nonetheless invaluably solidifies his Republican base . 
When the financial crisis hit , McCain went razzle-dazzle again , suspending his campaign and declaring that he 'd stay away from the first presidential debate until the financial crisis was solved . 
He tempted fate one time too many . 
After climbing up on his high horse , McCain had to climb down . 
The crisis unresolved , he showed up at the debate regardless , rather abjectly conceding Obama 's mocking retort that presidential candidates should be able to do `` more than one thing at once . '' 
-LRB- Although McCain might have pointed out that while he was trying to do two things , Obama was sitting on the sidelines doing one thing only : campaigning . -RRB- 
You ca n't blame McCain . 
In an election in which all the fundamentals are working for the opposition , he feels he has to keep throwing long in order to keep hope alive . 
Nonetheless , his frenetic improvisation has perversely -LRB- for him -RRB- framed the rookie challenger favorably as calm , steady and cool . 
In the primary campaign , Obama was cool as in hip . 
Now Obama is cool as in collected . 
He has the discipline to let slow and steady carry him to victory . 
He has not at all distinguished himself in this economic crisis -- nor , one might add , in any other during his national career -- but detachment has served him well . 
He understands that this election , like the election of 1980 , demands only one thing of the challenger : Make yourself acceptable . 
Once Ronald Reagan convinced America that he was not menacing , he won in a landslide . 
If Obama convinces the electorate that he is not too exotic or green or unprepared , he wins as well . 
When after the Republican convention Obama 's poll numbers momentarily slipped behind McCain 's , panicked Democrats urged him to get mad . 
He did precisely the opposite . 
He repositioned himself as ordinary , becoming the earnest factory-floor , coffee-shop , union-hall candidate . 
In doing so , he continues his clever convention-speech pivot from primary to general election . 
In a crowded primary field in which he was the newcomer and the stranger , he rose above the crowd on pure special effects : dazzling rhetoric , natural charisma , and a magic carpet ride of transcendence and hope . 
It worked for two reasons : Democrats believe that nonsense , and he was new . 
But now he needs more than Democrats . 
Obama understood that the magic was wearing off and the audacity of hope wearing thin . 
Hence the self-denial perfectly personified in his acceptance speech in Denver . 
He could have had 80,000 people in rapture . 
Instead , he made himself prosaic , even pedestrian , going right to the general election audience to project himself as one of them . 
Ordinariness was the theme . 
His self-told life story ? 
Common man , hence that brazen introductory biopic that shamelessly skipped from Hawaii grade-schooler to Chicago community organizer with not a word about Columbia and Harvard . 
His riff on American concerns ? 
His list of programs ? 
All pitched as his middle-class remedies . 
He 's been moderate in policy and temper ever since . 
His one goal : Pass the Reagan '80 threshold . 
Be acceptable , be cool , be reassuring . 
Part of reassurance is intellectual . 
Like Palin , he 's a rookie , but in his 19 months on the national stage he has achieved fluency in areas in which he has no experience . 
In the foreign policy debate with McCain , as in his July news conference with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Obama held his own -- fluid , familiar and therefore plausibly presidential . 
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. famously said of Franklin Roosevelt that he had a `` second-class intellect , but a first-class temperament . '' 
Obama has shown that he is a man of limited experience , questionable convictions , deeply troubling associations -LRB- Jeremiah Wright , William Ayers , Tony Rezko -RRB- and an alarming lack of self-definition -- do you really know who he is and what he believes ? 
Nonetheless , he 's got both a first-class intellect and a first-class temperament . 
That will likely be enough to make him president .

"Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has been urged to counter inflammatory comments . 
-LRB- Bill O'leary - The Washington Post -RRB- The head of the National Urban League is calling on Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to refute statements by conservative politicians and pundits that subprime mortgages provided to minorities led to the financial crisis and a $ 700 billion federal rescue of Wall Street . 
In a strongly worded letter to Paulson this week , Marc H. Morial said Paulson has `` an obligation to correct the misinformation that is spread concerning the root cause of the current financial crisis . '' 
Morial , a former mayor of New Orleans , said in an interview yesterday that the effort `` to pin the subprime crisis on African Americans and Latinos '' is a `` big lie . '' 
`` It 's an effort to shift the climate away from deregulation and the lack of oversight , '' he said . 
`` The numbers are becoming clearer each day that a large number of people who ended up with a subprime loan could have qualified for a prime loan . 
That 's the abuse that 's inherent here . '' 
Morial said he has not heard from Paulson . 
A spokeswoman at the Treasury Department was forwarded an electronic copy of the letter but did not respond . 
On the House floor , on cable network television and in Internet blogs in recent days , conservative politicians and commentators have traced the problem to the Community Reinvestment Act , or CRA , enacted in 1977 to extend loans to minorities who were historically denied homeownership . 
Rep. Michele Bachmann -LRB- R-Minn . -RRB- 
lashed out against the act , reading from an from Investor 's Business Daily article that said banks made loans `` on the basis of race and little else . '' 
Neil Cavuto , a business news anchor on Fox News , recently made a similar statement . 
In an exchange on television with Rep. Xavier Becerra -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- 
, Cavuto noted that the congressman pushed for more minority lending to `` folks who heretofore could n't get mortgages '' and asked , `` Are you totally without culpability here ? 
Are you totally blameless ? '' 
Defenders of the act say claims that it encouraged risky loans and caused the foreclosure crisis do not square with the facts of subprime lending . 
Only a tiny fraction of subprime loans made since 2000 were ever generated to meet the goals of the act , which requires banks and savings-and-loan institutions to provide credit to their lower-income clients as well as their wealthy ones , they said . 
John Taylor , president and chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition , an umbrella group that promotes access to credit and affordable housing , said such claims `` are on the level of Swift boat advertisements , except they are even less factual . '' 
`` People who are saying this do n't understand lending , but they sure do understand the political process , '' he said . 
`` They are trying to blame the victim , which is an old strategy that moneyed corporate interests always employ . '' 
Profit , he said , was the motive . 
`` People did not do this lending for CRA purposes . 
They did it because it was profitable . '' 
"
"Of all the reporting and editorializing that I have read and heard concerning our current financial crisis , Marc Fisher 's Sept. 25 Metro column , `` A Street Where Businesses Still Have Some Sense , '' came closest to the mark . 
By describing the responsible behavior of a few local business folk , Mr. Fisher was able to highlight the core of the problem in terms we can all understand . 
These business operators based their practices on judicious use of their own cash along with money borrowed sensibly -LRB- repayable credit against real assets -RRB- and are prospering . 
They used real money to increase their ability to provide goods and services at a profit . 
Contrast that with the `` financial sector '' and its egregiously unsound business practices . 
Its current decline derives as much from misfeasance as from misdeeds . 
For years , many in the financial sector have been operating on -LRB- actually , buying and selling -RRB- `` money '' backed by assets that they have never seen and do not own and that in many cases do not exist in terms of real value . 
They have treated `` money '' as a commodity to barter for their product -- more money . 
That they did not own the commodity has come home to roost . 
It 's as simple as that .

"Data on Job Losses , U.S. Factory Orders Paint Bleak Picture Mark Lovell operates a lathe at the Zildjian factory in Norwell , Mass. . 
Orders for U.S. manufactured goods dipped 4 percent between July and August . 
-LRB- By Michael Fein -- Bloomberg News -RRB- U.S. factory orders sank by the largest amount in nearly two years in August and the number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased to a seven-year high last week , ominous signs that the economy is in sharp decline . 
The bleak reports released by the government yesterday came after news earlier this week that manufacturing activity had tumbled to its lowest level since 2001 and consumer consumption had slowed sharply , heightening concern that the nation 's economy was sliding toward recession . 
Taken together , the data suggest the economy was struggling even before the financial crisis intensified last month . 
`` There has been a lot of bad news . 
There is no question that the U.S. economy is heading for a recession , '' said Nariman Behravesh , chief economist with Global Insight , a Massachusetts forecasting firm . 
`` The only question is when did it start ? '' 
The bad economic news has rattled investors on Wall Street , even as Congress considers a $ 700 billion bailout of the teetering U.S. financial system . 
With the Senate 's approval of the package Wednesday night , the House is expected to vote on it today . 
But even if the legislation is approved , a recession would only be tempered , not averted , analysts said . 
`` The data we 've seen recently suggests that the U.S. economy is entering a more dangerous phase and we are likely to see overall GDP contract , '' said Abiel Reinhart , an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase . 
While the U.S. economy expanded through the first half of this year , growing by 2.8 percent in the second quarter , economists are predicting that it will contract in the last part of this year and the early part of next year . 
Some economists say it might not begin growing again until the middle of 2009 . 
`` We 're in for a rough ride , '' Behravesh said . 
`` If the bailout does not occur , I think we 're in deep trouble . '' 
On Wednesday , industry research firm Autodata reported that sales of cars and light trucks in September had declined 27 percent compared with a year earlier . 
Speaking to reporters at the Paris auto show , Ford chief executive Alan Mulally said he believed the economic downturn would be `` deeper and longer '' than most people expected . 
He predicted the global auto market might not rebound until 2010 . 
The Commerce Department reported that orders for manufactured goods dipped 4 percent in August , the first decline after five consecutive monthly increases and the largest decline since October 2006 . 
Analysts use the report to glean insight into how busy U.S. factories will be in coming months and into the demand for such goods as refrigerators , cars , cigarettes and clothing . 
The report revealed weaknesses across the manufacturing sector . 
Aircraft orders were down 38.1 percent , and orders from iron and steel mills were down 16.7 percent from the previous month . 
Semiconductor orders were down 17.1 percent , and household appliances were off 6.9 percent . 
The decline in factory orders started before the implosion on Wall Street , which caused borrowing costs for many firms to skyrocket , a development expected to further slow manufacturing activity . 
Also , with economies cooling in many parts of the world , demand for U.S. exports , which have been one of the strongest parts of the economy over the past year , is expected to weaken . 
The economic slowdown will probably cause unemployment to spike . 
Last month , unemployment stood at 6.1 percent -- a five-year high -- but some analysts predict that it will reach 7 or 7.5 percent before the economy rebounds . 
And if the financial bailout package is defeated , the rate could go as high as 10 percent , Behravesh said . 
A Labor Department report released yesterday said the number of laid-off workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased to 497,000 last week , the highest level since just after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . 
Labor Department analysts said that the lingering impact of hurricanes Gustav and Ike raised that figure by about 45,000 . 
But even factoring in those special circumstances , economists said the number of unemployment claims was in line with an economy in recession . '' 
"
"Two September shocks will define the presidency of George W. Bush . 
Stunningly enough , it already seems clear that the second -- the financial crisis that has only begun to unfold -- may well have far greater and more lasting ramifications than the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 . 
That 's because while 9\/11 changed the way we view the world , the current financial crisis has changed the way the world views us . 
And it will also change , in some very fundamental ways , the way the world works . 
Of course , the Sept. 11 attacks left a deep scar on the soul of the country and caused immense tragedy . 
Beyond human losses , they also revealed that being the sole superpower did not make us safe . 
But the attacks themselves were not , in a real sense , as significant a turning point in world history as they may have seemed at the time . 
-LRB- Remember , it was actually Bush 's father who had first been put in charge of an American `` war on terror '' during the 1980s when he was Ronald Reagan 's vice president . -RRB- 
The current economic debacle is far more likely to be seen by historians as a true global watershed : the end of one period and the beginning of another . 
The financial chaos has brought down the curtain on a wide range of basic and enduring tenets also closely linked with the Reagan era , those associated with neoliberal economics , the system that the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has called `` that grab-bag of ideas based on the fundamentalist notion that markets are self-correcting , allocate resources efficiently and serve the public interest well . '' 
Already this crisis has seen not just our enemies but even some of our closest allies wondering whether we are at the beginning of the end of both American-style capitalism and of American supremacy . 
On Sept. 16 , 2001 , President Bush addressed the nation to express his faith in the American people and `` the resiliency '' of the U.S. economy . 
Seven years later , the president again spoke to a country in crisis , using eerily similar language to try to shore up concerns about the market . 
This time , however , he felt compelled to go further . 
During a prime-time broadcast to the nation , the president of the richest and most powerful nation on Earth felt compelled to offer a defense of the free-market capitalism whose final and enduring triumph we had been celebrating only a few years earlier after the fall of our Soviet foes . 
`` Despite corrections in the marketplace and instances of abuse , '' Bush said , `` democratic capitalism is the best system ever devised . '' 
To many around the world , however , the president 's words were not so reassuring . 
Not only did his argument ring hollow to those who felt anxiety and rage over Wall Street 's ineptitude and greed , its attempt to buoy American capitalism by lashing it to the virtues of democracy contrasted uncomfortably with a chorus of critical assessments from leaders in democracies worldwide . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy concluded recently that the world has seen the end to free-market economies . 
`` Laissez-faire , it 's finished . 
The all-powerful market that is always right , it 's finished , '' he said . 
We would , he added , need `` to rebuild the entire global financial and monetary system from the bottom up , the way it was done at Bretton Woods after World War II . '' 
Germany 's finance minister offered a similar perspective in remarks to his parliamentary colleagues . 
`` The U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the world financial system , '' Peer Steinbr ck declared . 
`` This world will become multipolar . 
The world will never be the same again . '' 
Governments long criticized by the United States for intervening in their own economies were reveling in the spectacle of U.S. policymakers wading into their own financial markets in ways that even some socialist leaders would never have dreamt of . 
There is some wishful thinking or gloating in these remarks , but they represent a massive wave of reassessments from every corner of the world and every point on the political spectrum . 
The strongly pro-market Financial Times declared that we are at the end of the era of American `` laissez-faire capitalism . '' 
From Beijing , Pan Wei of the Center for Chinese and Global Affairs speculated that the crisis would have a leveling effect : `` My belief is that , in 20 years , we will look the Americans straight in the eye -- as equals . 
But maybe it will come sooner than that . '' 
-LRB- Indeed , it seemed he might already be right . 
Reports from within the Treasury suggested that the U.S. government intervened in the financial sector , at least in part , in response to Chinese threats to reconsider their policy of buying U.S. debts unless Washington moved to stabilize the markets . -RRB- 
Buried in all of this , one can hear a refrain with eerie echoes of 9\/11 : that the United States `` had it coming . '' 
Indeed , one of the factors that links 9\/11 , the war in Iraq and this financial crisis is a sense that all of them are tied to the world 's changing view of America -- a view that is growing darker . 
While the `` blame America '' justification for terror is as odious as it is indefensible , we deserve our full share of the blame for the market disaster . 
An important dimension of this new anti-Americanism relates to Washington 's role as the architect , champion and primary beneficiary of a global system that was widely seen to benefit the few at the expense of the many . 
Much of the anger at the bailout and financial meltdown stems from the basic fact that we live in a world in which 1,000 people at the top control assets worth double those held by the bottom 2.5 billion , a world in which the top 10 percent own 85 percent of everything . 
And it 's a world in which that anger is likely to keep growing , because there are other dimensions of this crisis that suggest it could have a broader impact than any financial crisis in three-quarters of a century : This is only the tip of the iceberg . 
The collapse in mortgage-backed securities represents a problem with just one subset of a global financial system that has dramatically changed its character in just a generation . 
Not only is a deep U.S. downturn upon us , but it will hit countries such as China , which trade with the United States ; their slumps will depress commodity prices that in turn could cause crises in the emerging world . 
Complex securities invented by financial `` rocket scientists '' and understood by very few people have long ago surpassed currency as the primary repositories of `` value '' on the planet . 
But they are not issued by governments . 
Most are not regulated . 
The risks associated with them are hidden . 
According to polls of big institutional investors by the National Strategic Investment Dialogue , more than 80 percent do not feel their boards even understand the risks inherent in their portfolios -- as they are required to do by law -- primarily because of the complexity of these instruments and the new global financial system they dominate . 
In other words , this crisis -- which , last Monday alone , wiped away more value from the market than the Congressional Budget Office estimates has been spent to date in Iraq and Afghanistan -- is not important merely because it represents the most profound global ideological watershed since the fall of Soviet communism . 
It is important because it is a harbinger of massive global threats that fester within the system . 
And our leaders , from the president on down , have been caught as flat-footed by these new dangers as they were complacent and complicit in their hatching . 
We now know that the costs to the U.S. government associated with this crash will surpass those associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
We also know that all such government cost estimates tend to be on the low side . 
We further know that the U.S. economy recovered quickly after 9\/11 and that we are in the midst now of a global downturn that may last for many months and perhaps years . 
We know that there have been vastly more job losses -- 600,000 recorded thus far this year in the United States -- than were associated with the 9\/11 shocks , and that the global job-loss totals that a recession is likely to bring will be measured in the millions . 
Among the poorest , the likely shocks to emerging markets caused by the United States ' inability to spend freely will take a devastating human toll . 
Human costs are harder to measure , of course , and the tolls of both events have been devastating . 
But the financial crisis will certainly touch many more people in many more countries than did 9\/11 . 
And even greater crises may loom ahead , thanks to our unwitting creation of a financial Frankenstein 's monster of unregulated , risk-laden , global derivatives markets . 
As the dithering U.S. governing class is grappling with the disposal of `` toxic assets '' in the U.S. economy , the world is moving on to debate what is widely seen as a toxic ideology : a form of market fundamentalism that promotes inequality . 
While 9\/11 and this financial crisis are very different , the stakes of an economic battle can be as high as those in any military conflict . 
The era of `` leave it to the markets '' is clearly over . 
The question during this coming election is whether the United States will choose leaders who support a new American capitalism -- a long-overdue successor to the bankrupt dogma of Reagan-Thatcherism -- that includes effective regulation , recognizes the need for new international institutions to manage our complex global economy and accepts that government must act with markets to promote growth and to protect those whom markets leave behind . 
This is the central challenge that will fall to the next president : not just to navigate the shoals of a treacherous global economy but to reinvent what has been one of our proudest exports -- our distinctly American vision of how to create a just society .

"`` We all failed , '' CNBC correspondent Charlie Gasparino says of news outlets missing the danger signs of the current economic crisis . 
-LRB- Cnbc -RRB- Washington Post columnist Steven Pearlstein says his columns last year about a then-looming crisis were often dismissed . 
-LRB- By Alex Wong -- Getty Images For `` Meet The Press '' -RRB- David Brancaccio of PBS says journalists too often accept what `` smart people hand down to us . '' 
-LRB- By Peter Krogh -- Pbs -RRB- Charlie Gasparino was so anxious to get on the air that he phoned in to CNBC , rather than walking to the studio , to report that nervous federal authorities were considering a bailout of the insurance giant AIG . 
`` I was sweating through my underwear . 
That was scary , '' the correspondent says of his mid-September story , which was n't confirmed until that night . 
When his colleagues said on the air that their own sources were expecting AIG to go bankrupt instead , `` that freaked me out . '' 
The stakes are enormous in a fast-moving crisis where the traditional concern about journalists causing a run on the bank is hardly a theoretical danger . 
But as news organizations chase exclusives about the Wall Street meltdown , they also are grappling with a troubling question : Why did n't they see this coming ? 
`` We all failed , '' says Gasparino , a former Wall Street Journal and Newsweek reporter . 
`` What we did n't understand was that this was building up . 
We all bear responsibility to a certain extent . '' 
The shaky house of financial cards that has come tumbling down was erected largely in public view : overextended investment banks , risky practices by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , exotic mortgage instruments that became part of a shadow banking system . 
But while these were conveyed in incremental stories -- and a few whistle-blowing columns -- the business press never conveyed a real sense of alarm until institutions began to collapse . 
`` Did we not accent that enough ? 
Put it above the fold , or on the cover of Fortune , or lead off the television shows ? '' 
asks Fortune Managing Editor Andy Serwer . 
`` Yeah , that 's probably true . '' 
At the same time , he says , `` if we had written stories in late 2000 saying this whole thing 's going to collapse , people would have said , ` Ha ha , maybe , ' and gone about their business . '' 
After being burned by years of cheerleading before the dot-com collapse , the media warned repeatedly that the surge in housing prices might turn out to be a bubble . 
But the emphasis was generally on the potential toll on homeowners , not the banks that would be left holding bagfuls of bad loans . 
As in the savings-and-loan scandal of the late 1980s , the press was a day late and several dollars short . 
Marcus Brauchli , The Washington Post 's new executive editor , who was the Journal 's top editor until this past spring , says no policymaker who followed those papers , the New York Times , the Financial Times and CNBC could have been unaware of the explosive growth of derivatives that embedded debt across the financial system . 
Still , he says , `` I regret that when I was at the Journal , we did n't keep the focus on some of these questions , including the possible moral hazard posed by the structure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
These are really difficult issues to convey to a popular audience ... You do have an obligation as a journalist to push important issues into the public consciousness . 
We also have to remember you 're pushing against a powerful force , which is greed . '' 
It is not easy for journalists to take on the masters of the financial universe , especially when the market is going up and everyone is happy . 
Franklin Raines , then chief executive of Fannie Mae -- which was seized by the government last month -- complained to Brauchli about critical Journal stories in 2001 . 
Gasparino , who also broke the news about the Treasury bailout plan , says debt-rating agencies cried foul with his Journal bosses when he challenged their approach -LRB- some of today 's now-toxic loans , he notes , were rated AAA -RRB- . 
PBS 's David Brancaccio says that `` we journalists have had a long history with accepting what the smart people hand down to us , especially on complicated stuff ... When I would cover these very issues about problems with regulation , problems with ` is this a disaster waiting to happen ? ' 
people would say : ` Well , young man , you do n't have an MBA like I do . 
We went to business school . ' '' 
Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein , who won a Pulitzer Prize for columns last year warning about the magnitude of the coming crisis , says he was often dismissed as a pro-regulation zealot or gadfly critic of Alan Greenspan . 
`` The business press tends to get in with the people that they cover , '' he told me in a CNN interview . 
`` They get in the bubble that is Wall Street , just like political reporters get in the bubble that is the White House and the traveling press of the campaign ... and they do n't see the obvious things . '' 
"
"The financial turmoil has pushed the Obama campaign into the lead , and this is mostly justified . 
Barack Obama is more thoughtful on the economy than his opponent , and his bench of advisers is superior . 
But there 's a troubling side to the Democratic advance . 
The claim that the financial crisis reflects Bush-McCain deregulation is not only nonsense . 
It is the sort of nonsense that could matter . 
The real roots of the crisis lie in a flawed response to China . 
Starting in the 1990s , the flood of cheap products from China kept global inflation low , allowing central banks to operate relatively loose monetary policies . 
But the flip side of China 's export surplus was that China had a capital surplus , too . 
Chinese savings sloshed into asset markets ` round the world , driving up the price of everything from Florida condos to Latin American stocks . 
That gave central bankers a choice : Should they carry on targeting regular consumer inflation , which Chinese exports had pushed down , or should they restrain asset inflation , which Chinese savings had pushed upward ? 
Alan Greenspan 's Fed chose to stand aside as asset prices rose ; it preferred to deal with bubbles after they popped by cutting interest rates rather than by preventing those bubbles from inflating . 
After the dot-com bubble , this clean-up-later policy worked fine . 
With the real estate bubble , it has proved disastrous . 
So the first cause of the crisis lies with the Fed , not with deregulation . 
If too much money was lent and borrowed , it was because Chinese savings made capital cheap and the Fed was not aggressive enough in hiking interest rates to counteract that . 
Moreover , the Fed 's track record of cutting interest rates to clear up previous bubbles had created a seductive one-way bet . 
Financial engineers built huge mountains of debt partly because they expected to profit in good times -- and then be rescued by the Fed when they got into trouble . 
Of course , the financiers did create those piles of debt , and they certainly deserve some blame for today 's crisis . 
But was the financiers ' miscalculation caused by deregulation ? 
The key financiers in this game were not the mortgage lenders , the ratings agencies or the investment banks that created those now infamous mortgage securities . 
In different ways , these players were all peddling financial snake oil , but as Columbia University 's Charles Calomiris observes , there will always be snake-oil salesmen . 
Rather , the key financiers were the ones who bought the toxic mortgage products . 
If they had n't been willing to buy snake oil , nobody would have been peddling it . 
Who were the purchasers ? 
They were by no means unregulated . 
U.S. investment banks , regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission , bought piles of toxic waste . 
U.S. commercial banks , regulated by several agencies , including the Fed , also devoured large quantities . 
European banks , which faced a different and supposedly more up-to-date supervisory scheme , turn out to have been just as rash . 
By contrast , lightly regulated hedge funds resisted buying toxic waste for the most part -- though they are now vulnerable to the broader credit crunch because they operate with borrowed money . 
If that does n't convince you that deregulation is the wrong scapegoat , consider this : The appetite for toxic mortgages was fueled by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the super-regulated housing finance companies . 
Calomiris calculates that Fannie and Freddie bought more than a third of the $ 3 trillion in junk mortgages created during the bubble and that they did so because heavy government oversight obliged them to push money toward marginal home purchasers . 
There 's a vigorous argument about whether Calomiris 's number is too high . 
But everyone concedes that Fannie and Freddie poured fuel on the fire to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars . 
So blaming deregulation for the financial mess is misguided . 
But it is dangerous , too , because one of the big challenges for the next president will be to defend markets against the inevitable backlash that follows this crisis . 
Even before finance went haywire , the Doha trade negotiations had collapsed ; wage stagnation for middle-class Americans had raised legitimate questions about whom the market system served ; and the food-price spike had driven many emerging economies to give up on global agricultural markets as a source of food security . 
Coming on top of all these challenges , the financial turmoil is bound to intensify skepticism about markets . 
Framing the mess as the product of deregulation will make the backlash nastier . 
The next president will have to make some subtle choices . 
In certain areas , markets need to be reformed -- by pushing murky `` over-the-counter '' trades between banks onto transparent exchanges , for example . 
In other areas , government needs to fix itself -- by not subsidizing reckless mortgage lending . 
But a president who has a mandate only to reregulate will be a boxer with a missing glove . 
By going along with the market skepticism of his party , Obama may end up winning an election while compromising his presidency .

"'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | Talk + | Russia 's MICEX was quiet after trading was suspended . 
The global crisis is starting to affect the wider economy . 
-LRB- By Alexander Zemlianichenko -- Associated Press -RRB- MOSCOW , Oct. 6 -- Less than a year ago , one of Russia 's wealthiest tycoons , along with the nation 's powerful railways chief and the mayor of Moscow , unveiled plans to build a glittering new neighborhood of apartment towers , skyscrapers , schools , parks and shopping malls on a vast stretch of the city 's west side . 
Polonka Parkline was billed as the next step in the transformation of a booming capital on its way back to greatness , `` a city within a city '' that would be an architectural marvel , too . 
For the first time `` in the history of the world , '' the developer boasted , a 160-acre complex would be built on a platform over an old rail line -- without ever stopping the trains underneath from running . 
The trains still have n't stopped . 
But now , in the reverberations of the global financial crisis , Polonka Parkline itself has been put on hold , along with all of billionaire developer Sergei Polonsky 's projects , except those on which construction has already begun . 
`` We have decided to freeze implementation of all facilities that are in the development stage , '' Polonsky , 35 , flanked by the board members of his company , the Mirax Group , said at a recent news conference . 
`` The decision to enter construction sites will only be made if the market stabilizes . '' 
Polonsky 's move , suspending more than 80 percent of his company 's portfolio of projects , is one of many signs that the global turmoil that has pummeled the stock markets and banking system here is also beginning to be felt in the rest of the Russian economy , especially a real estate sector that has been soaring for more than a decade . 
Russia 's leading stock markets crashed again Monday , suffering another record one-day loss and hitting three-year lows . 
The benchmark MICEX and RTS indexes plunged 19 percent as regulators repeatedly suspended trading in an attempt to slow the free fall . 
The markets are down nearly two-thirds from their highs in May . 
Meanwhile , the Russian banking system is enduring a severe liquidity crisis triggered by a flight of capital and foreign loans . 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has responded by tapping the government 's immense cash reserves , built up during the long oil boom , and injecting as much as $ 100 billion into the financial system . 
The crisis has not been felt by much of Russian society . 
Only a fraction of the public invests in the stock markets , and the Kremlin 's moves to support the banks have prevented any run on deposits . 
But there are hints of trouble . 
Inflation is rising , industrial production is shrinking and several firms have said they are cutting bonuses or laying off staff . 
The impact of the crisis is clearest in real estate construction , one of the fastest-growing segments of the economy over the past few years but also one of the most heavily dependent on bank loans . 
With credit disappearing , other developers have joined Polonsky in announcing plans to halt construction . 
One of the hardest hit is Sistema Hals , the construction firm owned by Vladimir Yevtushenkov , the politically connected billionaire who also counts Russia 's top cellular provider among his assets . 
Sistema Hals , which had borrowed heavily to gain market share , now plans to unload a quarter of its portfolio to raise up to $ 500 million to pay down debts . 
`` Our clients are panicking , and that is affecting our business , '' said Dmitri Lutsenko , a member of Polonsky 's board of directors , adding that the interest rates demanded by Russian banks for loans have nearly tripled to about 25 percent and that the terms offered are shorter . 
`` Given the environment , it 's a good time to be cautious . ''

"This article quoted World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick as saying the world financial system may have reached a `` tipping point . '' 
Zoellick was referring to the effects of global turmoil on developing countries . 
Unfolding Worldwide Turmoil Could Reverse Years of Prosperity Traders work at the Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange in Sao Paulo . 
Brazilian stocks plunged the most in a decade as commodity producers dropped , and trading was halted twice because of the decline . 
-LRB- By Marcos Issa -- Bloomberg News -RRB- Last week , the nation 's political leaders said the financial system would collapse unless they passed a $ 700 billion rescue package for Wall Street . 
On Monday , the first day of trading after the plan passed , the financial system continued to melt down anyway . 
Here 's why : The plan developed by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to buy troubled U.S. mortgage assets might not start for another month . 
And , despite its huge price tag , it already seems paltry compared with the scale of the rapidly evolving global crisis . 
`` People are realizing that the Paulson plan is not going to be nearly enough . 
It 's not because the plan is ill-conceived . 
It looks like it 's the right thing to do , but the problem is just growing astronomically , '' said Martin Evans , a professor of finance and economics at Georgetown University . 
The bailout plan is focused on buttressing U.S. financial institutions . 
But it was global markets that plunged yesterday , as investors sold off commodities in Brazil , currency in Mexico , bank stocks in Russia and the short-term debt of the state of California . 
Robert B. Zoellick , president of the World Bank , said the global financial system may have reached a `` tipping point '' -- the moment when a crisis cascades into a full-blown meltdown and becomes extremely difficult for governments to contain . 
The mushrooming problems `` will trigger business failures and possibly banking emergencies . 
Some countries will slip toward balance-of-payment crises , '' he said yesterday , speaking at the Peterson Institute for International Economics . 
The crisis threatens to reverse years of prosperity that financed the economic growth in developed and emerging countries through a global financial system that made credit widely available . 
Banks and governments were able to borrow money on an unprecedented scale by selling debt in new kinds of packages , allowing even the least creditworthy consumers to borrow and spend . 
China exported goods and then loaned the money back to the United States by buying those new debt packages . 
The story was similar for Russia , which exported massive amounts of energy to Europe , and for Brazil , which exported commodities including orange juice and sugar . 
All used the massive inflows of borrowed money from the developed world to fuel economic expansions and stock market bubbles . 
Yesterday , trading on the major stock exchanges in Russia and Brazil was halted after prices crashed . 
China 's major indexes fell about 5 percent . 
The bubbles appear to be bursting in rapid succession . 
Faced with these developments , the markets have not been in a mood to cheer the passage of the Paulson rescue package . 
At one point yesterday , the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen nearly 800 points , more than 7 percent . 
It ended the day off 3.6 percent , below 10,000 for the first time since 2004 . 
`` Quite frankly , what the market is looking for is some kind of coordinated action from central banks around the world . '' 
said Kathy Lien , director of currency research at GFT Forex . 
The Paulson plan , she added , is like a `` Band-Aid for a problem that stretches way beyond the banking system now . '' 
"
"The financial crisis has gone global . 
Stock indexes have fallen and credit markets are seizing up around the world . 
In recent days , as most Americans focused on the political drama of the rescue package , a number of European banks have failed or been taken over . 
Several in Russia and Eastern Europe are teetering on the verge of insolvency . 
Many Latin American countries are newly vulnerable because foreign banks are big players there . 
Few nations can escape the financial contagion . 
Globalization of the crisis requires a globalized response . 
While the consequences of financial crises are clearly international , the regulation of finance remains almost wholly national . 
And national efforts , including the U.S. rescue plan and European governments ' remedies for their nations ' bank problems , will continue to be the first responses . 
Yet an internationally coordinated strategy , ranging far beyond the heroic efforts of the world 's leading central banks , is essential now that the U.S. rescue plan is in place . 
When finance ministers convene in Washington this week for the annual International Monetary Fund meeting , they should adopt several initial components of such a strategy . 
Not doing so would be almost as serious as if Congress had adjourned without passing the rescue legislation . 
First , heading off a precipitous decline in world economic activity requires a global stimulus program . 
Different governments can use different policy tools . 
China has room for fiscal expansion , while Europe could ease monetary policy . 
The United States can combine the two . 
A coordinated effort should boost confidence and would deter individual countries from attempting to escape the downturn via trade controls and other beggar-thy-neighbor policies . 
Second , coordination of the parallel national efforts to recapitalize tottering banking systems would pack a powerful psychological punch . 
The United States , European Union and some others are moving rapidly to shore up their financial institutions . 
But countries need both to do more and to avoid gaps in their rescue programs by agreeing on how to handle cross-border loans and financial institutions that operate across jurisdictions . 
Widespread international participation in the recapitalization effort , including by the highly liquid sovereign wealth funds , could be of substantial help . 
Third , as the United States and some Europeans are already doing , many countries will need to expand coverage of their deposit insurance programs to discourage bank runs . 
Parallel or uniform policy steps through which unlimited insurance is provided for at least a temporary period , as Germany and Ireland have done for their banks and the Treasury has for U.S. money market funds , will be mutually reinforcing and help prevent panic . 
Beyond the short term , countries will need to develop a cooperative framework to prevent and resolve such crises , most urgently within Europe . 
There is inherent tension as finance becomes global but its regulation remains national . 
The current crisis originated in the United States but was importantly affected by massive savings surpluses in some countries and the resulting surfeit of liquidity , which drove down interest rates and encouraged irresponsible lending here . 
Those international imbalances were in turn partly caused by misaligned exchange rates . 
Global oversight of both financial regulation and currencies can no longer be neglected . 
Our policy responses must reflect the interdependent vulnerability of the world economy . 
Although the Europeans rebuffed a recent U.S. initiative for a cooperative strategy and are having trouble getting their region-wide act together , it is too late to assign blame over responsibility for the crisis , within or among countries . 
The traditional Group of Seven industrial countries have mounted coordinated economic programs of this type in the past , with considerable success ; now they must be joined by the chief emerging markets , particularly China . 
The G-7 finance ministers should fully include the five or six main emerging markets in their upcoming meeting and seek to forge a global strategy . 
This week 's IMF conclave offers a unique opportunity to add a critical international dimension to the crisis response . 
C. Fred Bergsten , director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , was assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs from 1977 to 1981 .

"NASHVILLE , Oct. 7 -- On a day when the stock market took another sharp plunge , presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama clashed repeatedly here Tuesday night over the causes of the economic meltdown that has shaken the country and offered sharply contrasting prescriptions for how to restore stability . 
McCain played the role of the aggressor throughout the 90-minute debate , accusing his Democratic rival of favoring major tax and spending increases and of relying too often on big government programs to reshape the nation 's health-care system . 
He said he would do more to shake up Washington and bring cooperation to the capital . 
`` I have a clear record of bipartisanship , '' he said . 
`` The situation today cries out for bipartisanship . 
Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue . '' 
Obama countered by accusing the Republican of favoring Bush administration policies that he said had helped put the economy in dire straits . 
Those policies , he charged , called for less regulation and were based on the belief that by letting markets run wild , `` prosperity would rain down on all of us . '' 
`` It has n't worked out that way , '' he continued . 
`` And so now we 've got to take some decisive action . '' 
McCain used the debate to promote another approach to solving the economic crisis , saying he would have the government buy up bad mortgages and renegotiate them at the current lower housing values , thereby allowing struggling homeowners to remain in their homes . 
He argued that until the housing markets stabilize , the economy will continue to falter , and he sought to use the idea to demonstrate his independence from the Bush administration . 
`` It 's my proposal , it 's not Senator Obama 's proposal , it 's not President Bush 's proposal , '' he said . 
`` But I know how to get America working again , restore our economy and take care of working Americans . '' 
The Obama campaign called the mortgage idea `` old news , '' saying that a similar Treasury Department program is already underway as part of the economic rescue package and that Obama backed it . 
Although economic issues dominated much of the debate , some of the most pointed exchanges were over foreign policy . 
McCain charged that Obama had been wrong on the `` surge '' of U.S. troops in Iraq and accused his rival of `` talking loudly '' by threatening to attack Pakistan . 
Obama accused McCain of getting his facts wrong and said it was McCain whose rhetoric was belligerent . 
`` This is the guy who sang , ` Bomb , bomb , bomb Iran , ' who called for the annihilation of North Korea , '' Obama said . 
`` That I do n't think is an example of ` speaking softly . ' 
This is the person who , after we had -- we had n't even finished Afghanistan , where he said , ` Next up , Baghdad . ' '' 
The debate came after two weeks of focus on the economy that has shifted the electoral map in Obama 's favor . 
McCain was under pressure Tuesday to shake up the race with a dominating performance , but the likelihood is that , as sharp as some of the exchanges were , the contest may not change significantly as a result . 
Obama has opened up a lead in national polls and in some of the most important battleground states . 
Last week , McCain pulled out of Michigan , a state he had hoped to convert to his column . 
In the past few days , new polls have shown Obama leading in Ohio , which is critical to the Republican 's hopes . 
Even McCain 's running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , had said that it was time for the gloves to come off . 
Over the past few days , the McCain-Palin campaign has gone after Obama 's character and pointedly questioned his association with William Ayers , who was once a member of a 1960s domestic terrorist group . 
But while he was aggressive , McCain steered clear of those kinds of personal attacks . 
Instead , he laid out his differences with Obama largely on policy grounds , and repeatedly questioned whether his rival has the judgment and experience to run the country .

"The stock market 's prolonged tumble has wiped out about $ 2 trillion in Americans ' retirement savings in the past 15 months , a blow that could force workers to stay on the job longer than planned , rein in spending and possibly further stall an economy reliant on consumer dollars , Congress 's top budget analyst said yesterday . 
For many Americans , pensions and 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans are their only form of savings . 
The dwindling of these assets -- about a 20 percent decline overall -- is another setback just as many people are grappling with higher gas and food prices , more credit card debt , declining home values and less access to loans . 
`` Unlike Wall Street executives , American families do n't have a golden parachute to fall back on , '' said Rep. George Miller -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- 
, chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor . 
`` It 's clear that Americans ' retirement security may be one of the greatest casualties of this financial crisis . '' 
Even traditional pension plans , which are formally known as defined-benefit plans and are widely considered more stable , have been hit hard by the stock market 's volatility , losing 15 percent of their assets over the past year , Peter R. Orszag , director of the Congressional Budget Office , told the House panel . 
Despite the losses , companies will still be obligated to pay out the same pensions promised to employees but will have to recoup the extra costs in other ways , Orszag said . 
`` When pension assets decline in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans , the burden is on the workers , '' he said . 
`` When pension plan assets decline in defined-benefit plans , the burden is on the firm to make up the difference . 
The firm will have to pass those costs on to their workers , to their shareholders or to consumers . '' 
Defined-benefit plans are company-sponsored programs that provide retirement payouts based on an employee 's salary and tenure . 
The company shoulders the bulk of the investment decisions and risk . 
Defined-contribution plans , such as 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s , turn those tasks over to the worker and are subject to the whims of the stock market . 
Increasingly , employers have switched workers into defined-contribution plans . 
The federal government has also pushed 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans heavily , approving a law late last year that makes it easier for employers to automatically enroll their employees in them and other similar retirement plans . 
Defined-contribution plans tend to be more heavily weighted in stocks , either through individual holdings or mutual funds . 
As a result , said Orszag , `` the value of assets in defined-contribution plans may have declined by slightly more than that of assets in defined-benefit plans . '' 
Through September , the percentage loss for the year in average account balances among 401 -LRB- k -RRB- participants was between 7.2 and 11.2 percent , according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute 's analysis of more than 2 million plans . 
Employees between the ages of 56 and 65 who had the fewest years on the job were the least affected , while those 36 to 45 years old with the longest tenures suffered the steepest declines , said Jack L. VanDerhei , research director for the D.C.-based institute . 
Younger workers tend to have more stocks in their portfolios while older employees move toward safer investments such as bonds , VanDerhei said . 
The findings exacerbate a complaint among many workers and academics about 401 -LRB- k -RRB- and similar plans that are heavily tied to the stock market . 
Are they really the best retirement vehicles for workers ? 
`` The loss of retirement security is a reversal of fortune and the result of very specific flawed governmental policies that have been biased toward 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans , rather than the result of technological change or the logical consequences of global economic trends , '' Teresa Ghilarducci , a professor of Economic Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research , testified before the committee .

"They long have been political hot potatoes inside the Beltway , but suddenly Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have become pawns in the 2008 presidential campaign . 
During Tuesday 's debate , Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain -LRB- Ariz. -RRB- charged that the mortgage finance giants `` lit this fire '' under the economic crisis . 
He said Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama -LRB- Ill. -RRB- and `` his cronies '' encouraged the companies to make risky loans . 
And he claimed that he took a stand two years ago to rein them in . 
Obama gave a different view . 
He blamed McCain 's pursuit of `` deregulation of the financial system '' for helping to allow the housing crisis to spin out of control . 
Obama said he `` never promoted Fannie Mae . '' 
Rather , he said he warned policymakers two years ago of a brewing `` subprime lending crisis '' -- the very crisis that contributed to Fannie Mae 's and Freddie Mac 's downfall and their seizure by the government last month . 
The candidates ' records on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not as clear as their statements during the debate . 
A former top lobbyist for the mortgage giants said neither Obama nor McCain were regarded as central players in congressional discussions about their futures . 
`` We generally viewed McCain as critical of the model and generally viewed Obama as supportive of the model , '' said the lobbyist , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing political sensitivity surrounding the companies . 
McCain has repeatedly suggested that the companies caused the crisis , but many housing specialists say their role is more ambiguous . 
The financial crisis had its origins in an era of cheap credit that helped inflate housing prices . 
Fannie and Freddie took advantage of low rates to grow quickly . 
But when the bubble burst , and housing prices fell , their massive portfolios of mortgages and mortgage guarantees took a hit and lost billions . 
Further , lenders were far more aggressive about offering subprime and other risky loans than Fannie and Freddie . 
The companies eventually joined in , driven both by pressure to show they were supporting affordable housing and by a desire to maintain market share . 
Though the number of risky loans they took on was small compared to the overall size of their holdings , the actions may have ended up fueling or amplifying the mortgage downturn . 
Christopher J. Mayer , a professor at Columbia Business School , said the companies took advantage of their special governmental status to maintain a thin financial cushion in buying loans , allowing them to buy more -- all under the oversight of the federal government . 
`` Those lower capital requirements enabled them to take risks and grow their balance sheets , '' Mayer said . 
Both campaigns cite actions they took to try and avoid a mortgage disaster . 
In January 2005 , several Republicans led by Sen. Chuck Hagel -LRB- Neb. -RRB- introduced legislation to create a new , independent regulatory agency to oversee the companies . 
They had trouble getting supporters . 
Sixteen months later , after a regulator questioned Fannie Mae accounting , McCain signed on to the legislation as a co-sponsor and made a 359-word speech in the Senate . 
The legislation failed to win approval . 
Obama said little if anything publicly about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the crisis started . 
Other Democratic lawmakers , however , long protected the interests of the companies and pushed them to expand their support for low-income housing . 
Obama did warn about a looming subprime crisis in March 2007 , though by that time many analysts were already warning of the danger . 
Obama also pursued legislation to crack down on lenders who pushed unsuspecting borrowers into taking on mortgages they could not afford . 
Neither McCain and Obama is free of ties to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac insiders . 
Obama initially asked former Fannie Mae chief executive James A. Johnson to vet his vice presidential choices , but Johnson resigned as a controversy flared over his role . 
McCain 's circle of advisers includes former lobbyists and consultants for the companies . 
Obama claims that `` deregulation of the financial system , '' championed by McCain , led to the economic crisis . 
While McCain has generally subscribed to a free-market philosophy , he has favored regulation more often than many other Republicans . 
`` Only a restoration of the system of checks and balances that once protected the American investor , and that has seriously deteriorated over the past 10 years , can restore the confidence that makes financial markets work , '' McCain said in a 2002 speech . ''

"Sen. Barack Obama -LRB- D-Ill . -RRB- 
Speaks in Chillicothe , Ohio SPEAKER : SEN. BARACK OBAMA , D-ILL . 
-LRB- \* -RRB- OBAMA : We meet at a moment of great uncertainty for America . 
In recent weeks , we 've seen a growing financial crisis that 's threatening not only banks and businesses , but your economic security , as well . 
It 's getting harder and harder to get a loan for that new car or that startup-business or that college you 've dreamed of attending . 
And yesterday , millions of Americans lost more of their investments and hard-earned retirement savings as the stock market took another significant plunge . 
We need action now . 
The Treasury Department must move as quickly as possible to implement the rescue plan that passed Congress so we can ease this credit crisis that 's preventing businesses and consumers from getting loans . 
And we also must recognize that this is not just an American problem . 
In this global economy , financial markets have no boundaries . 
So the current crisis demands a global response . 
This weekend , finance ministers from the world 's major economies will meet in Washington . 
They must take coordinated steps to restore confidence and to maintain our financial markets and institutions . 
There are many causes of this crisis , and it 's very important that we respond using all the tools that we have . 
It 's encouraging that Treasury is considering dramatic steps to provide more capital to our financial institutions so they have money to lend . 
This is not a time for ideology -- it 's a time for common sense and a politics of pragmatism . 
The test of an idea must not be whether it is liberal or conservative -- the test should be whether it works for the American people . 
That 's what we should all be focused on in the days and weeks ahead . 
I know these are difficult times . 
I know folks are worried . 
But I believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because I believe in this country . 
Because this is the United States of America . 
This is a nation that has faced down war and depression ; great challenges and great threats . 
And at each and every moment , we have risen to meet these challenges -- not as Democrats , not as Republicans , but as Americans . 
We have seen our share of hard times . 
The American story has never been about things coming easy -- it 's been about rising to the moment when the moment is hard ; about rejecting panicked division for purposeful unity ; about seeing a mountaintop from the deepest valley . 
That 's why we remember that some of the most famous words ever spoken by an American came from a President who took office in a time of turmoil -- `` The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . '' 
Now is not the time for fear . 
Now is not the time for panic . 
Now is the time for resolve and steady leadership . 
We can meet this moment . 
We can come together to restore confidence in the American economy . 
We can renew that fundamental belief -- that in America , our destiny is not written for us , but by us . 
That 's who we are , and that 's the country we need to be right now .

"'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | Talk + | REYKJAVIK , Iceland , Oct. 9 -- The bad news just keeps coming for Icelanders , who in the last week have seen the international financial empire that they built on this remote North Atlantic island start to crumble , piece by piece . 
On Thursday came the worst shock so far : The government seized the country 's largest bank , completing the emergency takeover of virtually the entire financial system . 
Iceland might be called the first national casualty of the global financial tumult . 
Its currency , the krona , is in free fall . 
Foreign exchange markets are effectively closed -- for Icelanders who need to travel abroad , dollars or euros are nowhere to be found . 
The stock market has shut down until next week . 
The government has been placed in the role of international beggar , asking Nordic neighbors , the Russians and perhaps the International Monetary Fund for emergency loans . 
For an estimated 100,000 Icelanders -- a third of the population -- who owned shares in the nation 's three major banks , savings have been wiped out in a single , tumultuous week by uncontrollable events thousands of miles away . 
`` What can we do ? 
This is not a simple matter -- this is a national tragedy , '' said Vilhjalmur Bjarnason , a professor of business at the University of Iceland . 
He owned stock in all three banks . 
`` I was planning to use this money for my daughters , who are handicapped , '' Bjarnason said . '' 
... The fundamental question is , how can this happen in a civilized society ? '' 
In the past decade , banking 's rapid expansion helped transform this country founded by 9th-century Vikings into a kind of Switzerland of the North Atlantic . 
Families in Britain , Norway and the Netherlands sent their savings here . 
Living standards rose , and Reykjavik became a costly playground for Europe 's wealthy . 
`` The wealth trickled back to many places , '' said Bjarni Brynjolfsson , editor of the online magazine Iceland Review . 
`` To the arts , to musicians who played at the parties , to the caterers , to the restaurants , to the whole of society ... Everything seemed fine . '' 
The banking wealth also bought companies around Europe , including the Hamleys toy-shop chain in London , a British soccer team , property in the Netherlands . 
Until the spectacular collapse this week , the three banks ' assets were more than 10 times the economy of this longtime fishing outpost of 310,000 people . 
Economists and business leaders here say that the institutions had been fundamentally strong -- well financed , lots of liquidity and a history of never defaulting on loans . 
But in the past year , emerging economic troubles overseas started to pressure them and the country 's currency . 
Last week , when the smallest of the three , Glitnir , went for a routine refinancing from a German bank , it confronted the world 's frozen credit markets : sorry , no loan . 
The system began to unravel . 
The government announced last week that it was in effect nationalizing Glitnir -- Prime Minister Geir Haarde prefers the phrase `` take over . '' 
The move got people asking questions about the exposure of the country 's two other major banks . 
On Monday , Iceland 's currency dropped rapidly , and the government gave itself broad new emergency powers to intervene in all the banks ' affairs and replace their boards . 
The second-largest bank , Landsbanki , fell to government control the next day . 
Just when it seemed the worst was over , Icelanders awakened Thursday to the news that the largest bank , Kaupthing , had also been seized .

"Detroit 's Ills Symptomatic Of a Manufacturing Plague Ford Motor 's stock price fell 21 percent over concerns that the nation 's economic crisis will devastate auto sales . 
-LRB- By Bill Pugliano -- Getty Images -RRB- DETROIT -- First it was the outsourcing of components , and then vehicle assembly . 
Then gasoline prices shot up , slashing demand for trucks and sport-utility vehicles . 
Now , just when things seemed as if they could not get any worse here , the credit crunch and the subsequent stock market meltdown have dealt powerful new blows to the nation 's already reeling car industry . 
Concern that tightening credit and an overall economic downturn will lead fewer people to buy new cars sent General Motors ' stock price plunging 31 percent Thursday to close at $ 4.76 , the lowest since 1950 . 
Ford Motor fell 21 percent , closing at $ 2.08 . 
Thursday 's automobile stock sell-offs sparked new concern among economists and investors that the U.S. manufacturing sector , which had been slowly constricting , may be squeezed to an unimagined degree by the turmoil on Wall Street , posing a serious new economic threat at a time when the nation is already struggling with a financial sector collapse . 
Nowhere is the pain more evident than in Michigan . 
Falling sales of vehicles and heavy equipment have sent ripples through the manufacturing food chain . 
The state 's unemployment rate is now 9 percent , the highest in the nation . 
One in 16 home mortgages is `` seriously delinquent , '' trailing only Florida and Nevada . 
`` It 's devastating , '' said Gov. Jennifer Granholm -LRB- D -RRB- , who added that Michigan has lost nearly 400,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000 . 
`` Companies ... that are already slammed by globalization are being slammed by the credit crunch . '' 
GM 's market capitalization now stands at $ 2.69 billion . 
The day after the 1929 stock market crash , the company was worth seven times as much in inflation-adjusted dollars , according to market historian Bryan Taylor of Global Financial Data . 
The current crisis is worsening a long-term trend for the U.S. auto industry . 
Over the past eight years , Michigan has lost 47 percent of its vehicle manufacturing jobs and 27 percent of other manufacturing jobs , according to a government analysis . 
Nationally , the losses have been about 21 percent in each category . 
In an economic downturn , automobile companies are often the first to feel the pinch as consumers postpone expensive purchases . 
Industry sales dropped last month to levels not seen in almost 20 years . 
Ford fell 34.5 percent compared with the previous September ; Chrysler , 32.8 percent ; and General Motors , 15.6 percent . 
Even Toyota , known for fuel efficiency , saw sales drop by 32.3 percent . 
Not since 1993 had automakers sold fewer than 1 million cars in a single month . 
Yet with fear ruling the marketplace and banks reluctant to lend money even to borrowers with strong credit , analysts believe next year 's numbers are likely to be as bad . 
That means lower revenue for automakers and less money to spend on needed innovation . 
It means fewer jobs beyond the factory gate . 
According to David E. Cole , a researcher in Ann Arbor , Mich. , every auto plant job generates nine jobs among suppliers and the surrounding community -- four times the multiplier of a typical Wall Street slot . 
Ford senior economist Emily Kolinski Morris , who likened an economy without credit to an engine without oil , said : `` The dire warnings are not terribly overstated . '' 
Inside a former Cadillac factory in Detroit , Frank Venegas runs Ideal Group , an array of businesses , some closely connected to the auto industry .

"The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression is claiming another casualty : American-style capitalism . 
Since the 1930s , U.S. banks were the flagships of American economic might , and emulation by other nations of the fiercely free-market financial system in the United States was expected and encouraged . 
But the market turmoil that is draining the nation 's wealth and has upended Wall Street now threatens to put the banks at the heart of the U.S. financial system at least partly in the hands of the government . 
The Bush administration is considering a partial nationalization of some banks , buying up a portion of their shares to shore them up and restore confidence as part of the $ 700 billion government bailout . 
The notion of government ownership in the financial sector , even as a minority stakeholder , goes against what market purists say they see as the foundation of the American system . 
Yet the administration may feel it has no choice . 
Credit , the lifeblood of capitalism , ceased to flow . 
An economy based on the free market can not function that way . 
The government 's about-face goes beyond the banking industry . 
It is reasserting itself in the lives of citizens in ways that were unthinkable in the era of market-knows-best thinking . 
With the recent takeovers of major lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the bailout of AIG , the U.S. government is now effectively responsible for providing home mortgages and life insurance to tens of millions of Americans . 
Many economists are asking whether it remains a free market if the government is so deeply enmeshed in the financial system . 
Given that the United States has held itself up as a global economic model , the change could shift the balance of how governments around the globe conduct free enterprise . 
Over the past three decades , the United States led the crusade to persuade much of the world , especially developing countries , to lift the heavy hand of government from finance and industry . 
But the hands-off brand of capitalism in the United States is now being blamed for the easy credit that sickened the housing market and allowed a freewheeling Wall Street to create a pool of toxic investments that has infected the global financial system . 
Heavy intervention by the government , critics say , is further robbing Washington of the moral authority to spread the gospel of laissez-faire capitalism . 
The government could launch a targeted program in which it takes a minority stake in troubled banks , or a broader program aimed at the larger banking system . 
In either case , however , the move could be seen as evidence that Washington remains a slave to Wall Street . 
The plan , for instance , may not compel participating firms to give their chief executives the salary haircuts that some in Congress intended . 
But if the plan did n't work , the government might have to take bigger stakes . 
`` People around the world once admired us for our economy , and we told them if you wanted to be like us , here 's what you have to do -- hand over power to the market , '' said Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel Prize-winning economist at Columbia University . 
`` The point now is that no one has respect for that kind of model anymore given this crisis . 
And of course it raises questions about our credibility . 
Everyone feels they are suffering now because of us . '' 
In Seoul , many see American excess as a warning . 
At the same time , anger is mounting over the global spillover effect of the U.S. crisis . 
The Korean currency , the won , has fallen sharply in recent days as corporations there struggle to find dollars in the heat of a global credit crunch . 
`` Derivatives and hedge funds are like casino gambling , '' said South Korean Finance Minister Kang Man-soo . 
`` A lot of Koreans are asking , how can the United States be so weak ? '' 
Other than a few fringe heads of state and quixotic headlines , no one is talking about the death of capitalism . 
The embrace of free-market theories , particularly in Asia , has helped lift hundreds of millions out of poverty in recent decades . 
But resentment is growing over America 's brand of capitalism , which in contrast to , say , Germany 's , spurns regulations and venerates risk .

"The Next World War ? 
It Could Be Financial . 
A bank customer holds a handful of Icelandic crowns in downtown Reykavik , Iceland . 
-LRB- Pall Stefansson\/Getty Images -RRB- The global financial outlook grows more dire by the day : The United States has been forced to shore up Wall Street , and European governments are bailing out numerous commercial banks . 
Even more alarmingly , the government of Iceland is presiding over a massive default by all the country 's major banks . 
This troubling development points not only to an even more painful recession than anticipated , but also to the urgent need for international coordination to avoid something worse : all-out financial warfare . 
The ramifications of Iceland 's misery are probably more serious than people realize . 
The country 's bank assets are more than 10 times greater than its gross domestic product , so the government clearly can not afford a bailout . 
This is going to be a large default , affecting many parties . 
In the United Kingdom alone , 300,000 account holders face sudden loss of access to their funds , and the process for claiming deposit insurance is not entirely clear . 
But there 's a broader concern . 
With European governments turning down his appeals for assistance , Iceland 's prime minister , Geir Haarde , warned last week that it was now `` every country for itself . '' 
This smacks of the financial autarchy that characterized defaulters in the financial crisis in Asia in the late 1990s . 
Similarly , when Argentina defaulted on its debt in 2001 - ' 02 , politicians there faced enormous pressure to change the rule of law to benefit domestic property holders over foreigners , and they changed the bankruptcy law to give local debtors the upper hand . 
In Indonesia and Russia after the crises of 1998 , local enterprises and banks took the opportunity of the confusion to grab property , then found ways to ensure that courts sided with them . 
This is a natural outcome of chaotic times . 
Iceland 's promise to guarantee domestic depositors while reneging on guarantees to foreigners may be just a first step . 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's decision last week to sue Iceland over this issue may escalate the crisis . 
The use of counterterrorist legislation to take over Icelandic bank assets and operations in the United Kingdom also has a potentially dramatic symbolic effect . 
Most of the time , financial war of this kind is painful and costly . 
It will lead to decades of lower international capital flows and could have other far-reaching effects on politics and global peace . 
Unless the leading industrial countries take concerted action , there 's a very real danger that we will all suffer more . 
In addition , we 're now likely to see substantially more defaults and credit panics in smaller countries and emerging markets . 
After Iceland 's fall , every creditor to other nations with large deficits and substantial external debt must be looking for ways to reduce its exposure . 
The obvious risks include much of Eastern Europe , Turkey and parts of Latin America . 
Russia 's difficulties show that seemingly solvent countries can be high-risk : While the Russian central bank has gold and foreign exchange reserves of $ 556 billion , the private sector has recently built up an estimated $ 450 billion of debt . 
Creditors do n't want to roll over the debt , so the government is using its reserves to do it . 
It has already ordered $ 200 billion channeled through state banks to companies repaying debt . 
If oil prices fall , a seemingly highly solvent country could quickly look nearly insolvent . 
Some other rising stars , such as Brazil and even India , may have similar problems . 
Added to this are worrying signs that the credibility of U.S. authorities is on the decline . 
Despite Washington 's moves to stabilize the financial system , credit and equity markets continue to drop . 
This pattern is reminiscent of the 1997-98 Asian crisis , when successive International Monetary Fund programs provided briefer and briefer respites from market routs in emerging economies . 
There is now a risk that continued corporate and bank defaults within nations , matched by large shifts in capital flows across nations , will lead to a chaotic series of national and local defaults . 
If governments do n't respond with sensible , coordinated policies , there 's a risk of financial war . 
Here are six steps toward avoiding a situation of `` each nation for itself '' : 1 . 
The world 's leading financial powers -- at a minimum , the United States , the United Kingdom , France and Germany -- should jointly announce national plans to require recapitalization of banks -LRB- i.e. , restructuring their debt and equity mixture -RRB- so that they have sufficient capital to weather a major global recession . 
How this is done can be determined internally by each nation , but this should be a common goal , so that citizens and companies can again trust their banks . 
The countries should announce a temporary blanket guarantee on all existing bank deposits and debts . 
This will , in effect , promise creditors that they can safely expect the institutions to function until the recapitalization takes place , and it will help prevent the large flows of funds that could occur as some banks or countries conduct recapitalizations earlier than others . 
This guarantee should only be temporary -LRB- say , for six months -RRB- . 
The monetary authorities of these countries need to lower interest rates dramatically . 
Europe , Canada and the United States recently announced a coordinated 0.5 percent reduction in rates . 
This is a good start , but only a start . 
More will be needed , and it wo n't stop the credit crunch within or across countries . 
The events of the last nine months have set us on course for a global recession in which commodity prices will continue to fall and demand will remain weak . 
Inflation will be low , and deflation -LRB- falling prices -RRB- is a risk . 
More interest-rate cuts will be needed . 
The monetary authorities also need to remain committed to pumping liquidity into the financial system as long as credit markets and interbank lending remain weak . 
This should be promised for at least one year .

"If the global economy survives the autumn and our cable-TV companies are still in business come Christmas , Americans surfing the channels for classic Yuletide movies may finally figure out exactly whom they have to blame for the housing bubble and everything that has followed . 
Forget the predatory lenders , Wall Street sharks and their government enablers : It all started with George Bailey . 
Yes , that George Bailey -- the hero of Frank Capra 's `` It 's a Wonderful Life , '' the most popular man in Bedford Falls , the man so indispensable that he earned a private visitation from a guardian angel just to show him how dreadful a world without him would have been . 
It 's easy to forget , so potent is the supernaturally charged final act of Capra 's classic , that before he was visiting looking-glass worlds where he 'd never been born or scampering through the snow and shouting `` Merry Christmas ! '' 
till his lungs burst , Jimmy Stewart 's George Bailey was actually a pretty savvy businessman . 
And it 's even easier to forget the precise nature of his business : putting the downscale families of Bedford Falls into homes they could n't quite afford to buy . 
This is the substance of the great war between Bailey and Lionel Barrymore 's Mr. Potter , the richest , meanest man in Bedford Falls . 
Potter is against easy credit and the suburban dream , against the rabble moving out of his tenements and buying homes , while the Bailey Building and Loan exists to make suburbia possible . 
The Bailey vision is economic and moral all at once . 
In a mid-movie peroration , the hero lectures Potter and a gaggle of local entrepreneurs on the virtues of democratizing homeownership : `` You 're all businessmen here , '' he presses them , sounding for all the world like a politician defending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac against their critics in 2004 or so . 
`` Does n't it make them better citizens ? 
Does n't it make them better customers ? 
... What 'd you say a minute ago ? 
They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home . 
... Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars ? '' 
In the movie , George Bailey has God on his side , but a real-life Bailey would have had Uncle Sam . 
`` It 's a Wonderful Life '' debuted in 1946 , more than a decade after Franklin D. Roosevelt 's National Housing Act kicked off a half-century of federal policymaking aimed at making it dramatically easier for working-class Americans to buy and keep their homes . 
As a political text , Capra 's movie enjoys obvious bipartisan appeal -- liberals can thrill to its attacks on Potter 's corporate fat-cattery , while conservatives can retort that the film asks us to root for a rival businessman and the tight-knit community that supports him , not for a government regulator or welfare office . 
Likewise , the movie 's vision of working-class Americans fanning out from the slums to the suburban promised land of Bailey Park has animated government policy in Republican and Democratic eras alike -- from Roosevelt 's New Deal down to George W. Bush 's `` ownership society . '' 
For three generations , suburban homesteading has been underwritten by our infrastructure spending , our zoning policies , our banking regulations and our tax code . 
Easy credit , inexpensive mortgages , cheap gasoline , wide-open highways , the heavy hand of federal regulators on any bank that declined to lend in low-income or minority neighborhoods -- if it made homeownership cheap and suburbia accessible , Americans were for it , never mind what the critics said . 
Potter-style skepticism about these trends endured , but it was safely marginalized . 
The Potters of the right griped that banks and government agencies were being forced to take on too much risk in the name of expanding minority homeownership -- and that besides , renting was often more economically sensible and investing your money in the stock market instead of your home delivered higher long-term returns . 
But their arguments fell upon deaf ears . 
The Potters of the left , increasingly vocal since the 1960s , argued that the whole business was unsustainable : If overpopulation or oil shocks or anomie did n't bring suburbia crashing down , then global warming would , and the only thing to do was to de-sprawl and retrench . 
But as suburbs gave way to exurbs , Levittowns to `` sprinkler cities , '' Americans were too busy watching HGTV and fantasizing about `` great rooms '' and three-car garages to listen . 
Until 2008 , that is , which may be remembered as the year when the American Dream 's excesses -- from gas-guzzling SUVs to subprime mortgages -- suddenly threatened to strangle the dream itself . 
This summer and fall , George Bailey 's vision has endured a stunning one-two punch . 
First , months of skyrocketing gas prices -LRB- along with dire forecasts about `` peak oil '' -RRB- made suburbia seem unsustainable , conjuring up a future in which Americans huddle together around subway stops and light-rail stations , exchanging the backyard and the garage for townhouses and apartments . 
And then this autumn came the mortgage-fueled financial sector meltdown , in which Potter 's warnings about letting the working poor buy homes on credit seemed to find their vindication in a worldwide economic crisis . 
The next decade , then , seems likely to belong to Potters from both sides of the aisle . 
Once the bailouts end , bankers and bureaucrats alike will grow increasingly tightfisted . 
Easy credit will become a privilege of wealth and mortgages vastly more difficult to get . 
No president in the near future -- and certainly no Republican president -- will unveil any sweeping plans to add 5.5 million more minority homeowners by reducing down-payment requirements the way Bush , eager to woo Hispanics and exurban voters , did with his minority homeownership initiative in 2002 . 
Meanwhile , America 's infrastructure priorities will probably take a distinctly European turn -- especially under Democratic leadership -- with a greater focus on mass transit , walkable cities and `` smart growth '' and declining support for the kind of subdivided , car-connected sprawl that has flowed outward from our cities since the days of Bailey Park . 
Gas will probably get more expensive , thanks to stricter environmental regulations as well as market pressures ; so will McMansions and big lawns , vaulted ceilings and master suites . 
More Americans may well eschew the suburbs entirely , opting for the denser , mixed-use neighborhoods that New Urbanists have been urging on us for decades -- kinder , gentler and hipper versions of the Pottersville depicted in George Bailey 's nightmare vision , dotted with coffee shops and farmers ' markets instead of honky-tonks and gin joints .

"-LRB- By M. Spencer Green -- Associated Press -RRB- The facade of the New York Stock Exchange , where shares have tumbled . 
The Dow Jones industrial average is off 36 percent for the year ; many would-be retirees are anxious about their savings . 
-LRB- By Daniel Acker -- Bloomberg News -RRB- Rep. George Miller , chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor , convened a hearing on 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s. -LRB- By Dennis Cook -- Associated Press -RRB- For many Americans , 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans were supposed to be their own little golden parachutes into retirement . 
Now , it seems , those parachutes may not open in time . 
The global financial crisis that revealed the flaws of Wall Street has also exposed the vulnerability of America 's retirement system . 
Employers have increasingly abandoned traditional pensions , forcing workers to rely on 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s and similar plans that have a lot more exposure to the stock market . 
The assumption was that even if the market suffered short-term losses , over time it would rise , allowing workers to recoup their savings . 
But the steepness of this year 's market collapse and the still-uncertain depth of the economic downturn has prompted lawmakers , academics and economists to question the wisdom of letting workers hitch their retirement fortunes to the precariousness of the stock market . 
So far this year , the Dow Jones industrial average is down 36 percent , eroding the savings of millions of Americans and forcing those who had planned to retire in the next few years to reconsider their plans . 
`` Right now , we 're really seeing the risks come home , and people are recognizing the extent to which their retirement savings are on the line when the stock market goes down drastically , '' said Jacob Hacker , a political science professor at the University of California at Berkeley who chronicled the advent of 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans in `` The Great Risk Shift . '' 
Until three decades ago , Social Security and pensions , formally known as defined-benefit plans , were the main sources of retirement income . 
Now , Social Security is in danger of eventually running out of money . 
And defined-benefit plans , in which employers made the investment decisions and promised to pay employees a set amount each month for the rest of their lives , are quickly disappearing . 
Favored by the `` ownership society '' movement , defined-contribution plans , which 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s fall under , have picked up the slack . 
In 1985 , there were 29 million participants in defined-benefit plans and 10 million in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s. In 2005 , there were 21 million in defined-benefit plans and 47 million in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s. The government has encouraged that shift , providing $ 80 billion in tax breaks each year to people who store their money in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s. But in return , workers have had to assume the investment responsibilities even if they know little about the stock market . 
They have also had to give up their lifetime guarantee of income . 
`` Everyone wiped their hands of any obligation for retirement , and the burden shifted from the employer to the employee , and the risk is shifted from the employer to the employee , '' said Rep. George Miller -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- 
, chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor , who last week convened a hearing to examine 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s. `` In the beginning , no one ever said , ` Would this be sufficient ? 
Would it work ? ' 
and what you see is a plan that is highly responsive to external events unlike Social Security , unlike defined-benefit plans , unlike a public pension plan . '' 
Proponents of 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s say with those greater risks come greater rewards . 
`` If you own equities , you really have to believe in the American capitalist system in that the dollars will find the highest and best use , '' said Mickey Cargile , a managing partner for WNB Private Client Services , a financial advisory firm in Texas . 
`` Along with that , there will be a period in which the excesses in the market will be purged . 
That 's what we 're seeing now . 
That 's what we saw in 1987 . '' 
In the past15 months , Americans have lost about $ 2 trillion worth of retirement savings both in pensions and 401 -LRB- k -RRB- - style plans , Peter R. Orszag , director of the Congressional Budget Office , told Miller 's committee last week . 
Because 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s tend to have more stocks in their portfolios than pensions do , Orszag concluded that 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s have been the biggest losers . 
This year , the average account balance of 401 -LRB- k -RRB- participants has dropped 7.2 to 11.2 percent , according to an analysis of 2.2 million plans by the District-based Employee Benefit Research Institute . 
But many workers have seen even sharper declines in recent months , analysts and economists say . 
Further draining retirement accounts is that many workers have been allowed to dip into their 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s for loans or so-called hardship withdrawals . 
That trend has been increasing in recent months because people can no longer tap the equity in their homes to pay down credit card debt . 
The experts disagree over how long it takes to recover from a bear market . 
The financial firm T. Rowe Price found that in the past five bear markets going back to 1976 , the longest it took for stocks to recover from their peak and then provide a 10 percent annual compound return was eight years . 
The shortest was five months .

-LRB- AP Photo\/Charles Dharapak -RRB- -LRB- Charles Dharapak - AP -RRB- -LRB- Photos By Melina Mara -- The Washington Post -RRB- Officials from 20 major countries yesterday endorsed a coordinated approach to the financial crisis , but they failed to announce any concrete steps , underscoring the difficulty of crafting a global plan to halt the contagion as it spread to the broader economy . 
The announcement , made in Washington by finance ministers from major developed countries as well as emerging giants such as China and Brazil , echoed a broad set of principles outlined Friday by the world 's richest nations . 
But critics have described such responses as too bland and vague to calm panicked investors following the record rout on stock markets last week . 
Advocates for a coordinated global response say that the scope of the financial crisis requires enormous resources and that a piecemeal approach by individual countries leaves the global system exposed to weaknesses . 
Lack of faith in any one country 's response could spark investor unease , and that unease could quickly spread across borders . 
`` You need specific , concrete steps , not a list of principles that are obvious and everyone can easily agree to , '' said Simon Johnson , former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics . 
`` It 's not what the markets are looking for before trading starts in Asia . '' 
The financial crisis is now zapping consumer spending and dragging down the global economy . 
In the United States , the manufacturing sector has been particularly hard hit . 
In one of the most dramatic signs of the slowdown , General Motors , a touchstone of U.S. industry , is now considering a merger with Chrysler . 
Investors may have had unrealistic expectations of how quickly diplomats could act . 
The specifics of possible solutions to the crisis -- such as how to expand insurance for depositors and guarantee lending between banks -- are still being hotly debated in the diplomats ' home countries , many of which face unique economic challenges . 
Some have huge and troubled banking systems , while others have few ailing banks at all . 
Some are dealing with a collapsing real estate market , while others were never threatened by a housing bubble . 
`` Each of the G-7 nations knows what has to be done , what the government needs to do , '' Shoichi Nakagawa , the Japanese finance minister , said in an interview yesterday , referring to the Group of Seven industrialized nations . 
`` Each country understands what needs to be done . '' 
After meeting with financial ministers from the G-7 yesterday , President Bush called on world governments to continue working together to stabilize collapsing financial markets . 
`` All of us recognize that this is a serious global crisis and therefore deserves a serious global response , '' Bush said . 
Leaders had agreed , he added , to `` take decisive action to support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure , provide robust protection for retail bank deposits and ensure financial institutions are able to raise needed capital . '' 
In an unusual step , Bush attended the G-20 meeting yesterday evening . 
He acknowledged that the epicenter of the crisis is in advanced countries and said the United States would make all possible efforts to overcome it , according to a White House statement . 
In Europe , French President Nicolas Sarkozy held talks yesterday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
Merkel had previously resisted adopting a plan to partially nationalize banks , along the lines of a plan announced by Britain and another one taking shape in the United States . 
But yesterday , she suggested she was rethinking objections to the government taking an equity stake in banks , saying that Germany would announce a new plan at a European summit in Paris today . 
She said the German plan would involve `` providing banks with sufficient capital so that they are able to operate on their own -- and I do n't rule out that there could be capital support . '' 
German resistance to major capital infusions in the banking system had been seen as a stumbling block to a coordinated approach in Europe . 
But even if that hurdle falls , it is unclear how major European powers would act to stabilize the banking system in smaller countries . 
The challenge of developing a coordinated approach is made all the more difficult because diplomats lack a viable forum in which to hold talks , analysts say . 
Calls are rising to disband , or expand , the G-7 , created at a time when the United States , Europe and Japan monopolized economic power and when countries such as China were not as relevant economically as they are today . 
The broader group meeting this weekend , known as the Group of 20 , also includes Brazil , Mexico and other emerging economies . 
But its authority and the scope of its mission are limited . 
Yesterday , Guido Mantega , Brazil 's finance minister and chairman of the G-20 , said it was time for the organization to be rethought , calling it ill-suited to respond to a crisis . 
The group meets infrequently , mainly to talk about broad , long-term matters . 
`` The G-20 was not created to deal with this sort of situation , '' Mantega said . 
`` Its makeup does not really allow it to act in a decisive fashion . 
There is no real structure to deal with an emerging economic problem . 
We have to turn the G-20 into a tool of some kind that can provide action better . '' 
The International Monetary Fund , an institution long charged with global economic stability , has meanwhile been relegated to the sidelines . 
Although it played the leading role in emerging market crises in 1990s , which spread through Latin America and Asia , the current worldwide crisis dwarfs the fund 's ability to manage it . 
The IMF has instead been largely left to offer gentle advice to U.S. and European officials , while entering talks on possible assistance to deeply troubled Iceland and preparing to contain the crisis at the margins as it spreads to the developing world . 
Fund action in the developing world may prove necessary , analysts say . 
Although China and Brazil , for instance , are flush with cash reserves and appear poised to withstand the crisis even better than the West , the banking systems in other parts of the developing world could prove more fragile . 
`` The developed countries have the means to deal with the problem , but we who are developing countries , or emerging countries , could collapse under the weight of such a crisis , '' said Adib Mayaleh , the governor of Syria 's central bank said in Washington yesterday . 
`` Our banking systems could come really crashing down . '' 
The IMF has about $ 196.2 billion available to lend to its members in a relatively short period , an amount that analysts say should be enough to manage a string of problems in smaller nations . 
The World Bank yesterday released a list of 28 developing countries that had already been hit hard by rising prices for food and fuel and are now highly vulnerable to the global financial crisis . 
Several are on the cusp of failing to cover their foreign debt or meeting budget needs , including Nepal , the Central African Republic and Eritrea . 
`` The impact on developing countries will be unavoidable , '' said Justin Lin , chief economist for the World Bank . 
`` We have the obligation to make some preparation ; we need to be ready financially in order to help the poor people , the vulnerable people . ''

-LRB- AP Photo\/Charles Platiau , Pool -RRB- -LRB- Charles Platiau - AP -RRB- PARIS , Oct. 12 -- Governments around the world took unprecedented steps Sunday to rescue the global financial system , with major European powers unveiling a united plan to prevent further bank failures while Australia and New Zealand moved to calm panicked investors by guaranteeing deposits before stock markets opened in Asia . 
With the newly decisive moves , other major nations are catching up to or surpassing the United States in sculpting a response to the crisis , which crashed stock markets last week and is threatening a broader collapse of the world 's interconnected banking system . 
Although Congress has given the Treasury Department wide authority to intervene in financial markets with a $ 700 billion bailout plan , officials are still trying to figure out how best to execute it . 
This morning , Assistant Treasury Secretary Neel Kashkari , who has been tapped to orchestrate the bailout , is scheduled to give a speech in Washington on the giant rescue package . 
In addition to Australia and New Zealand , the United Arab Emirates guaranteed all deposits with local banks yesterday , including the country 's two largest lenders , Emirates NBD and National Bank of Abu Dhabi , to ensure that credit continues to flow . 
This follows moves by some European countries , including Ireland and Germany , to remove or raise the limit on deposit insurance . 
The United States also increased guarantees for banking deposits from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 . 
In Europe , where dissent over how to handle the crisis has added fuel to investor panic in recent weeks , leaders presented a unified response for the first time . 
At an emergency summit of the 15 countries that use the euro , the continent 's major economic powers agreed Sunday to offer government guarantees for troubled banks trying to raise funds and pledged that public money would be used aggressively to make sure no European bank is allowed to fail . 
Europe 's vow to temporarily guarantee bank debt -- a measure aimed at restoring flows of credit between financial institutions afraid to lend to one another in the current climate -- goes beyond what U.S. officials have promised . 
The euro jumped 1.1 percent against the dollar in Asian trading late Sunday . 
In a show of unity , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown joined leaders here for part of their meeting even though his country has not adopted the euro as its national currency . 
Brown planned to announce Monday an $ 86 billion package of credit guarantees and bank-recapitalization plans that many are calling a partial nationalization of the British financial system . 
In recent days , the U.S. Treasury has also shifted toward a plan to have the government infuse capital in exchange for part-ownership . 
The Sunday Times reported that Brown 's package would include the government taking a majority share in the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Halifax Bank of Scotland , two of Britain 's largest banks . 
Officials in Paris said the Europe-wide plan adopted by the 15 countries in the euro group was inspired by British measures , suggesting that Europeans were also ready to buy into troubled banks heavily to prevent them from failing . 
`` This is indeed a common action that we are taking , '' French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who holds the European Union 's rotating presidency , said in announcing the accord at the Elysee Palace . 
The agreement was only a framework -- `` principles and orientations , '' according to Jean-Claude Trichet , head of the European Central Bank -- and each government planned to take specific steps on a national level , according to its own interpretation of what should be done to bolster its banks , Sarkozy said . 
In that regard , the outcome was similar to an agreement reached Saturday in Washington by finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations . 
Sarkozy also called a special meeting of his government for Monday morning to outline his country 's plans .

"The U.S. government is dramatically escalating its response to the financial crisis by planning to invest $ 250 billion in the country 's banks , forcing nine of the largest to accept a Treasury stake in what amounts to a partial nationalization . 
News that European governments also planned to take stakes in their banks and anticipation of new U.S. measures unleashed a tremendous surge in U.S. stock prices yesterday , with the Dow Jones industrial average soaring to the biggest percentage gain since the 1930s , up 11.1 percent . 
It ended 936.42 points higher , the largest point gain ever , just days after the Dow had its steepest weekly decline in history . 
The Treasury Department 's decision to take equity stakes in banks represents a significant reversal , coming just weeks after Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had opposed the idea . 
In a momentous meeting yesterday afternoon in Washington , Paulson , flanked by top financial regulators , told the executives of nine leading banks that they needed to participate in the program for the good of the national economy , two industry sources said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly . 
The government 's initiative , which was to be announced this morning before the markets open for New York trading , is part of a wider plan that goes beyond the $ 700 billion rescue package approved by Congress earlier this month . 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is also set to announce today the launch of an insurance fund to guarantee new issues of bank debt . 
It will provide unlimited deposit insurance for non-interest-bearing accounts , which are widely used by small businesses for payroll and other purposes . 
In pressing the bank executives to accept partial government ownership , Paulson 's message was clear : Though officially the program was voluntary , the banks had little choice in the matter . 
In exchange for giving the Treasury minority stakes , the nine firms would jointly receive an investment worth $ 125 billion . 
The government would make another $ 125 billion available for the next 30 days to thousands of other banks and thrifts across the country . 
Federal officials set conditions , telling the banks they could not raise their dividends without government permission and could not offer their executives new retirement packages , though the old packages would remain intact . 
Paulson told them the moves would shore up confidence in their own institutions , spark lending throughout the system and send a message to smaller institutions that there is no stigma in accepting federal funding . 
Though some were reluctant , all of the executives complied . 
There is a risk that banks will take the new government capital and use it to bolster their balance sheets but still not resume lending , and the Treasury is not getting any specific contractual guarantee to prevent that from happening . 
But bank regulators , particularly the Federal Reserve , will lean heavily on the firms receiving infusions to use the capital to increase their lending to businesses and consumers . 
Taken together , the steps planned by the Treasury , the FDIC and the Federal Reserve amount to a monumental effort to jump-start the business of lending , which all but dried up in recent weeks as banks have lost faith in one another and their customers . 
Global markets began to melt down . 
Some emerging nations teetered on the brink of financial collapse . 
Over the weekend , global leaders agreed in meetings in Washington to launch a coordinated program of injecting cash into the world 's banks and guaranteeing their debt . 
The action by U.S. officials yesterday represented the U.S. version of those broad principles , and it was matched by similar efforts in Europe yesterday . 
As part of the effort to flood the financial system with cash , the Federal Reserve made unlimited funds available early yesterday to other major central banks so they could inject money into banks in their countries and ease the shortage of dollars they face . 
Previously , the Fed 's program of lending dollars to the European Central Bank , Bank of England , Bank of Japan and others had been capped at a total of $ 380 billion . 
Under the rescue legislation signed into law earlier this month , the Treasury is allowed to take equity stakes in banks .

"'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | At Indian Call Centers , Another View of U.S. . 
The Aegis call center in India hums with activity . 
As the U.S. economy drops , outsourced debt collection booms . 
-LRB- By Emily Wax -- The Washington Post -RRB- GURGAON , India -- With her flowing , hot-pink Indian suit , jangly silver bangles and perky voice , Bhumika Chaturvedi , 24 , does n't fit the stereotype of a thuggish , heard-it-all-before debt collector . 
But lately , she has had no problem making American debtors cry . 
For the past three years , Chaturvedi has been a top collection agent at her call center , phoning hundreds of Americans a day and politely asking them to pay up . 
As the U.S. financial crisis plunges Americans into debt , her business is one of the fastest-growing sectors in Indian outsourcing . 
It is also one of the few sectors of outsourcing in India that is still hiring aggressively . 
Sitting in a narrow cubicle , her head-set switched on , Chaturvedi listens every night to increasingly disturbing tales of woe from the other side of the globe . 
`` My mortgage payments are just too high , honey . 
I just ca n't make the payment this month , '' a weeping woman with a Southern accent recently told her in response to a call for a $ 200 credit card payment . 
`` I 'm sure y ' all heard about the credit crunch and gas prices . 
I 'm flat broke . '' 
`` Ma'am , I am here to help you , '' Chaturvedi calmly said . 
`` Ma'am , maybe you could make a small payment , $ 100 or $ 50 , anything that you can . '' 
Few places in India absorb and imitate American culture as much as call centers , where ambitious young Indians with fake American accents and American noms de phone spend hours calling people in Indiana or Maine to help navigate software glitches , plan vacations or sell products . 
The subculture of call centers tends to foster a cult of America , an over-the-top fantasy where hopes and dreams are easily accomplished by people who live in a brand-name wonderland of high-paying jobs , big houses and luxury getaways . 
But collection agents at this call center outside New Delhi are starting to see the flip side of that vision : a country hobbled by debt and filled with people scared of losing their jobs , their houses and their cars . 
`` Lately , 25-year-old Americans are telling me that they are declaring themselves bankrupt , '' said Chaturvedi , raising her eyebrows in shock . 
`` These days the situation is so emotional , so fragile . 
We have to have so much empathy and patience . '' 
`` It 's like people are totally drowning , '' said Omkar Gadgil , 24 , who goes by the alias Richard Rudy and was a math major in college . 
He is brainy and considered the office expert on the intricacies of debt collection . 
`` There has just been years of overspending and now : the crash . '' 
In the past , debt-saddled customers were often annoyed by Chaturvedi 's calls from the open-air office at Aegis BPO Services . 
But now they seem depressed , defeated . 
Even the men sob into the phone , several agents said . 
Under the pseudonym Carol Miller , Chaturvedi 's ability to deftly work around the standard line , `` The check is in the mail , '' is now being challenged by clients throwing out new responses : `` How do you expect me to pay ? 
This is the worst crisis since the Great Depression . '' 
Chaturvedi said she has never seen it so bad . 
Many of the young employees say they are flabbergasted at just how widespread the financial ruin appears to be .

"It 's Wall Street 's Turn to Bolster Confidence Morgan Stanley chief executive John Mack , left , and Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit leave a meeting at the Treasury Department yesterday . 
-LRB- By Mark Wilson -- Getty Images -RRB- Now , what was that about Hank Paulson having blown it ? 
How he foolishly let Lehman Brothers go under and started a chain reaction that quickly turned into a financial meltdown ? 
How he was so focused on his cockamamie plan to buy up distressed mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , instead of injecting capital into banks in exchange for shares ? 
How he and the other finance ministers were so way behind the curve this past weekend in failing to come up with a detailed and coordinated plan to restore confidence in financial markets ? 
The truth is we were going to have a serious financial crisis no matter what Paulson did or did n't do , thanks to the incredible ineptitude of Wall Street and the nation 's financial regulators over the past few years , whether an insolvent and mismanaged investment bank was rescued or not . 
Lehman was the veritable straw that finally broke the back of the financial camel overloaded with debt . 
If it had n't been Lehman , it would have been something else . 
Since Lehman 's failure , Paulson has moved faster , more aggressively and more deftly than any of his international counterparts in doing whatever was necessary to stabilize the financial system . 
Yesterday , he and his collaborators at the Fed and FDIC threw everything they had at it -- flooding the banking system with an unlimited supply of dollars , expanding deposit insurance , putting a guarantee on new bank debt , injecting capital into healthy banks , giving the Japanese the assurances they needed to rescue Morgan Stanley , and doing nothing to discourage free-spending Democrats from their plans to offer another big economic stimulus plan . 
The result : the biggest one-day rally on stock markets in 70 years . 
I hope you wo n't think it petty to point out that some of the people who this past weekend were complaining that the Treasury secretary was being too timid in his response to the financial crisis were some of the same people who , three weeks ago , were complaining about his audacity in demanding a `` $ 700 billion blank check . '' 
I know I speak for Gov. Sarah Palin and Joe Six-Packs everywhere in pleading that , for Pete 's sake , let 's cut the guy a little slack . 
In putting several trillion dollars in government funds on the line , the country has now done just about everything that Wall Street could have asked to address the financial crisis . 
The question now , as John Kennedy might have put it , is what Wall Street is ready to do for its country . 
So far , the answer is not much . 
After getting their closed-door briefing yesterday from Paulson on the government 's latest initiatives , Wall Street 's finest literally ran from the Treasury to their waiting limousines , bypassing a media scrum eager to convey any scrap of wisdom or insight . 
Court reporters will tell you they can always tell the innocent from the guilty on these kinds of perp walks , and the Wall Street crowd yesterday looked particularly guilty , unable even to conjure up a soothing word to a nation fretting over its shrunken 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s , or a simple thank you to taxpayers for having saved their bacon . 
Their silence and invisibility throughout this crisis attests to the moral and political bankruptcy of a financial elite that is the perfect match for the financial bankruptcy they have now visited upon their investors , their creditors and their customers . 
After yesterday 's `` historic '' meeting , we are told by industry apologists that we are supposed to be grateful to nine leading banks for having `` volunteered '' to accept additional capital from the Treasury , along with a government guarantee for newly issued bank debt , even if it means having to accept a dilution of existing shares and a few harmless restrictions on their operations .

"ZURICH -- Of all the places in the world , this was supposed to be the safest to stash your wealth during times of calamity , war and financial panic . 
But here in the heart of Zurich 's financial district , anxious Swiss investors have been lining up to watch the stock tickers in front of the headquarters of UBS , a financial behemoth that has written off a stunning $ 43 billion in loser investments since 2007 , more than any other bank in Europe . 
`` The idea that this could happen in Switzerland is unbelievable , '' said Klaus Stoeckli , 55 , a food-products salesman who has withdrawn about $ 90,000 in investments from UBS , worried that its storied vaults might not be able to protect his money from the global credit crisis . 
UBS executives say the bank is not in danger of failure . 
It has cut 7,000 jobs worldwide and is still trying to unload billions of dollars ' worth of risky securities . 
But the bank has moved aggressively since December to reinforce its balance sheet with $ 25 billion in fresh private capital . 
It announced this month that it expects to report a small profit for the third quarter . 
But the scare has forced Switzerland for the first time to contemplate the disaster that would result if one of its champion banks failed . 
It 's been a shocking exercise for a country that has long cultivated a reputation for unsurpassed security -- and secrecy -- in its banking industry . 
If UBS were to collapse -- as has already occurred with banks in Britain , Germany , France and Belgium -- it is unclear if the Swiss government could amass enough money to rescue it , analysts said . 
UBS has more than $ 1.75 trillion in assets worldwide , a figure about four times as large as Switzerland 's gross domestic product . 
`` Swiss banks have always operated on the basis that they have an implicit guarantee of the state , '' said Manuel Ammann , director of the Swiss Institute of Banking and Finance in St. Gallen . 
`` But these large banks impose substantial risks on the Swiss economy , simply because of their size . '' 
UBS traces its roots to the mid-19th century . 
A combination of the former Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. , it prospered during the bank-merger boom of the past two decades and manages more private wealth assets than any other financial institution in the world . 
While UBS is the largest bank in Switzerland , it 's not the only giant affected by the credit crisis whose sheer size looms over the Swiss economy . 
One block away on the Bahnhofstrasse , Zurich 's main street for high finance and luxury shopping , is the headquarters of Credit Suisse , with $ 1.1 trillion in assets . 
Though Credit Suisse has also suffered in the past year , it has not been hit as hard as UBS , its longtime rival . 
So far , the Swiss government has had little to say about the financial turmoil , adhering to the national tradition of silence and discretion when it comes to money matters . 
On Oct. 6 , the Swiss Federal Council , the executive body that runs the Swiss government , issued a statement saying it was `` prepared to take appropriate measures should the need arise '' and was `` committed to ensuring the stability of the financial system . '' 
But it has said almost nothing about the travails of UBS , or commented on whether it has developed any contingency plans . 
`` One would like to have learned how a UBS would be saved , when it has become too big to be saved by little Switzerland alone , '' the Neue Zuercher Zeitung , a leading Swiss newspaper , wrote in an editorial . 
`` It was once again crisis management la Suisse : If it 's serious , say nothing . ''

"A decade ago , long before the financial calamity now sweeping the world , the federal government 's economic brain trust heard a clarion warning and declared in unison : You 're wrong . 
The meeting of the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets on an April day in 1998 brought together Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. -- all Wall Street legends , all opponents to varying degrees of tighter regulation of the financial system that had earned them wealth and power . 
Their adversary , although also a member of the Working Group , did not belong to their club . 
Brooksley E. Born , the 57-year-old head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , had earned a reputation as a steely , formidable litigator at a high-powered Washington law firm . 
She had grown used to being the only woman in a room full of men . 
She did n't like to be pushed around . 
Now , in the Treasury Department 's stately , wood-paneled conference room , she was being pushed hard . 
Greenspan , Rubin and Levitt had reacted with alarm at Born 's persistent interest in a fast-growing corner of the financial markets known as derivatives , so called because they derive their value from something else , such as bonds or currency rates . 
Setting the jargon aside , derivatives are both a cushion and a gamble -- deals that investment companies and banks arrange to manage the risk of their holdings , while trying to turn a profit at the same time . 
Unlike the commodity futures regulated by Born 's agency , many newer derivatives were n't traded on an exchange , constituting what some traders call the `` dark markets . '' 
There were now millions of such private contracts , involving many of Wall Street 's top firms . 
But there was no clearinghouse holding collateral to settle a deal gone bad , no transparent records of who was trading what . 
Born wanted to shine a light into the dark . 
She had offered no specific oversight plan , but after months of making noise about the dangers that this enormous market posed to the financial system , she now wanted to open a formal discussion about whether to regulate them -- and if so , how . 
Greenspan , Rubin and Levitt were determined to derail her effort . 
Privately , Rubin had expressed concern about derivatives ' unruly growth . 
But he agreed with Greenspan and Levitt that these newer contracts , often called `` swaps , '' were n't exactly futures . 
Born 's agency did not have legal authority to regulate swaps , the three men believed , and her call for a discussion had real-world consequences : It would cast doubt over the legality of trillions of dollars in existing contracts and create uncertainty over how to operate in the market . 
At the April meeting , the trio 's message was clear : Back off , Born . 
`` You 're not going to do anything , right ? '' 
Rubin asked her after they had laid out their concerns , according to one participant . 
Born made no commitment . 
Some in the room , including Rubin and Greenspan , came away with a sense that she had agreed to cool it , at least until lawyers could confer on the legal issues . 
But according to her staff , she was neither deterred nor chastened . 
`` Once she took a position , she would defend that position and go down fighting . 
That 's what happened here , '' said Geoffrey Aronow , a senior CFTC staff member at the time . 
`` When someone pushed her , she was inclined to stand there and push back . ''

"Audio excerpts of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's radio addresses from the Great Depression FDR delivers one of his famed fireside chats from the White House . 
-LRB- AP -RRB- What might FDR say in a fireside chat during the financial crisis of 2008 ? 
Seventy-five years ago , the nation was gripped by a Great Depression . 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt seized on the power of a new technology -- radio -- to explain the complex financial situation to frightened , helpless Americans . 
FDR won popular support for radical programs and executive power grabs by comforting and uplifting his listeners . 
In the mid-1930s , the U.S. population of 130 million was poor , uneducated and without hope . 
Unemployment was 25 percent in 1933 and did n't drop to single digits until the U.S. entered the war in 1941 . 
Only one-third of Americans were high school graduates . 
Millions still depended on farms for subsistence , much less a livelihood . 
Imagine how far from Main Street Wall Street must have seemed then . 
In our time of financial crisis , when everyone from the President to the world 's richest person is telling us we 're near the abyss , it 's worth hearing what a previous president said when Americans actually were in the abyss . 
The first thing you 're struck by when listening to these recordings -- other than their sometimes-staticky quality -- is the timbre of Roosevelt 's patrician voice , so unfamiliar to us . 
The second thing is the grandiosity of his language , which would be lost on many of today 's educated Americans . 
Just imagine listening as a Dust Bowl farmer who could maybe only print his name . 
Some of these recordings are from his famous fireside chats ; others are taken from speeches . 
Each has at least one phrase that resonates eerily with today 's crisis . 
After defeating Alfred Landon , Governor of Kansas , carrying 46 of the 48 states , Roosevelt declares his unwillingness to accept the notion that one third of the nation can be regarded as superfluous in his second inaugural address , saying , `` We are determined to make every American citizen the subject of his country 's interest and concern . '' 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- Days before Election Day in late October of 1936 , FDR blasts previous administrations for ignoring mounting problems and shunning the needs of Americans . 
He says he will fight for `` low interest rates , better banking , for the regulation of security issues ... and against the costs added by monopoly and speculation . '' 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- On October 8 , 1936 , the 50th birthday of the Statue of Liberty , Roosevelt praises immigrants old and new , saying that their search for peace and freedom transcends class , place of birth and all other considerations . 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- Love of Liberty for All `` Liberty is the air that we Americans breathe . '' 
At the Harvard tercentenary in September of 1936 , Roosevelt reminds the other alums that their love of liberty and truth is a virtue shared with all their fellow citizens , including the less well educated . 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- During a speech on Labor Day of 1936 , Roosevelt addresses the dust bowl drought and the crisis faced by American farmers , telling the nation that all Americans must help save farms . 
It is remarkable to hear a president speak on issues such as underground water levels and topsoil erosion . 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness Accepting the re-nomination of the Democratic Party in late June of 1936 in a speech in Philadelphia , Roosevelt cites life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as economic necessities as well as political rights . 
He refuses to apologize for a government that has sometimes erred on the side of charity . 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- On Brotherhood Day , February 23 , 1936 , Roosevelt addressed the National Conference of Christians and Jews . 
Individual happiness , he told them , was inextricably bound up in the happiness of the community . 
`` Our well-being depends in the long run on the well-being of our neighbors . ''

Roosevelt found an awakened social consciousness in America to be perfectly compatible with the free enterprise system . 
On August 24 , 1935 he told a meeting of young Democrats that the virtues taught to his generation , those of unbridled individualism , have proved themselves to be inadequate , telling the youth they must be responsible for the less fortunate . 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- Amid rampant unemployment throughout the country , Roosevelt created the Works Progress Administration . 
Employment was so tight , in his radio address of April 28 , 1935 , FDR tells older workers to retire and take Social Security , freeing up a job for someone younger -- a concept unimaginable today . 
He calls the recovery `` a great national crusade to destroy enforced idleness , which is an enemy of human spirit generated by this depression . '' 
He said that the government would be the temporary employer of last resort and promised the WPA would be efficient and politically clean . 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- In June of 1933 , Roosevelt enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act which authorized the president to stimulate banks and regulate the economy through the National Recovery Administration . 
On September 30 , 1934 FDR delivered a fire-side chat in which he urged an end to hostilities between management and labor saying , `` Lay aside the weapons common to industrial war . '' 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- On May 7 , 1933 , eight weeks after his inauguration , FDR outlines his New Deal strategy to radio listeners , describing a national industrial recovery program that would make the government the protector of workers ' rights . 
-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- On March 12 , 1933 , Roosevelt delivers the first of his fireside chats from the White House on the banking crisis .

-LRB- Download Audio File -RRB- On March 4 , 1933 Roosevelt gave his first inaugural address .

At home , Americans were questioning capitalism .

"Most of the advice offered to solve the financial crisis has been based on the wrong diagnosis and has naturally offered the wrong remedy . 
The problem does not derive from a market that failed because of deregulation and that has to be rescued by the government ; the problem originated with government policies and political directives that caused market signals to malfunction . 
Ross Douthat -LRB- `` Not So Wonderful Now , '' Outlook , Oct. 12 -RRB- and others recommend significant government expenditures , relying on naive Keynesian multipliers and assuming that the additional expenditures will not crowd out private expenditures . 
For real reform , we have to go back to Milton Friedman 's 1960 book , `` A Program for Monetary Stability , '' and impose 100 percent reserves on commercial bank accounts . 
-LRB- Loans would be made from a different kind of account , would receive `` deposits subject to risk '' and would pay interest accordingly . -RRB- 
This would make deposit insurance obsolete , reduce interest rates , prevent bank runs and save taxpayers money through the closing of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. . 
We do not need much more regulation other than to put a ceiling on leverage by investment banks and to impose , and enforce , market-based regulations . 
Market-based regulations will do away with bureaucrats riding a turtle while trying to catch up to a race horse . 
The Oct. 10 front-page analysis `` The End of American Capitalism ? ''

"Fears about the global crisis helped Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservative Party gain seats in Tuesday 's vote . 
-LRB- By Mike Ridewood -- Getty Images -RRB- TORONTO , Oct. 15 -- While the United States reels from the global financial crisis , with credit markets still frozen and stock prices careening from highs to lows , Canada has remained relatively insulated . 
Canadian banks have not gone shaky like their American counterparts , economists and other experts said . 
There is no subprime mortgage or home foreclosure mess . 
And while the United States fears a prolonged recession , Canadians have remained relatively sanguine , convinced that they are in a good position to weather the economic tsunami from the south . 
`` We will be pulled down , '' said Michael Gregory , chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns , an investment firm . 
`` Not as deep , not as long . '' 
The main reason for optimism here is the banking system . 
Experts here note that Canadian banks are more tightly regulated , more liquid and less highly leveraged . 
Instead of being highflying investment banks , they tend to operate in a more traditional manner , with large numbers of loyal depositors and a more solid base of capital . 
`` I think the regulatory framework in Canada is a little more stringent , '' Gregory said , `` and Canadian banks are a little more conservative in terms of lending . '' 
The World Economic Forum this month rated Canada 's banks as the world 's soundest , ahead of banks in Sweden and Luxembourg . 
According to the Canadian Banking Association , one reason for the system 's solidity is that banks are national in scope . 
Each of the largest five institutions has branches in all 10 Canadian provinces , meaning they are less susceptible to regional downturns and they can move capital from region to region , as needed . 
`` As far as I am aware , no American bank has branches in all 50 states , '' banking association spokesman Andrew Addison wrote in an e-mail . 
Strict rules also govern mortgage lending . 
By Canadian law , any mortgage that will finance more than 80 percent of the price of a home must be insured . 
Two-thirds of all Canadian mortgages are insured by the quasi-governmental Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp. . 
As a result of the tough standards for insurance , `` people tend not to get mortgages they can not afford , '' Gregory said . 
Defaulting on a loan is also more difficult in Canada than the United States , Gregory said . 
`` You ca n't just drop off the keys and walk away . '' 
For Canada 's seven biggest banks , the percentage of mortgages at least three months in arrears was 0.27 percent in July , close to historic lows , according to the banking association . 
Also , few Canadian banks got caught holding large numbers of toxic American mortgages . 
Another difference is that in Canada , mortgage interest is not tax-deductible , making it harder to buy a house . 
As a result , Canada did not have as strong a construction surge as the United States did during the boom years , and thus does not now have a big oversupply . 
People do not take out mortgages just for the tax break . 
In Canada , `` a mortgage is seen as something you want to get rid of as fast as possible , '' said Peter Dungan , an economist with the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto . 
Amid this relative health , there have been reports that American companies , needing cash and credit , have been turning to their Canadian subsidiaries for short-term loans . 
But Canada 's economy has not been entirely trouble-free . 
The Toronto Stock Exchange is down . 
The appreciation of the Canadian dollar has harmed exports . 
The slowdown in the United States -- which takes 80 percent of Canada 's exports -- has a direct impact here . 
In particular , the American housing troubles have hurt because much of the wood in new U.S. houses comes from Canada . 
`` What Americans are not buying is directly what we export , '' Dungan said . 
Fears about the global crisis helped Prime Minister Stephen Harper increase his Conservative Party 's presence in Parliament in Tuesday 's elections , many analysts here believe , though the party still fell short of an absolute majority . 
Harper called the election in September , just before the crisis hit . 
After some initial verbal stumbles -- he at first seemed to play down the fall of the Toronto exchange -- he campaigned as the steady hand to see Canada through hard economic times ahead . 
Polls showed that the economy was the main issue in the election .

"Airlines Brace for Impact of Crisis Delta Air Lines chief executive Richard Anderson and other executives said the carrier was somewhat insulated from the economic downturn . 
-LRB- By Chris Rank -- Bloomberg News -RRB- For much of the year , it appeared the surging price of oil would be the chief challenge facing the airline industry . 
Now airline executives are bracing for another threat : the deteriorating economy . 
To counter higher fuel costs , most major U.S. airlines have been operating in survival mode for much of the year -- piling on fees , cutting routes and taking planes out of service . 
But even those actions have done little to eliminate losses . 
American Airlines parent AMR reported a $ 45 million profit for the third quarter yesterday , but the carrier 's results were boosted by the sale of an investing unit , American Beacon Advisors . 
Excluding that sale and other one-time items , American 's quarterly losses amounted to $ 360 million . 
A year ago , the world 's largest airline had third-quarter profit , also excluding special items , of $ 215 million . 
Delta Air Lines , meanwhile , posted a $ 50 million loss in the third quarter , compared to the $ 220 million in income the company reported a year ago . 
With fuel prices falling in recent weeks -- oil prices fell below $ 75 a barrel yesterday , down from a peak of $ 147 in July -- some analysts and airline executives expressed hope that the industry may now have some breathing room to confront the economic slowdown . 
But not everyone is so certain . 
`` The wild card is the economy , '' said Gerard J. Arpey , AMR chairman and chief executive , who has helped manage the airline through two recessions and a major terrorist attack . 
`` I do n't think anybody really knows what the fallout is going to be from all this financial turmoil . '' 
Arpey said efforts to cut back on routes and flights have given the airline `` lots of degrees of freedom '' to work through troubles if economic activity `` significantly goes in the wrong direction or if oil likewise goes in the wrong direction . '' 
Arpey said the airline has trimmed capacity by 8 percent in the current quarter vs. the previous one and modestly lowered its forecasts for 2009 . 
Despite reports of clogged debt markets , American announced a large order for new Boeing airplanes . 
American said it ordered 42 Boeing 787 airplanes and placed options on 58 additional 787 planes . 
The planes , known as the Dreamliner , will replace older and less fuel-efficient 767 planes in American 's fleet . 
Additionally , American said it had successfully obtained financing for 20 previously ordered Boeing 737s . 
Arpey refused to give details about financing for the planes . 
He called on lenders in the credit markets to make a distinction between companies that have a track record of paying off loans and those that do n't . 
`` It should matter to the capital markets who pays you back and who does n't , and as you know we have paid folks who have lent us money , '' Arpey said . 
`` Over many , many years , we 've paid them back , and I 'd like to think that that does matter and is mattering right now . '' 
Airline executives said they are seeing signs that business and vacation travel are falling off as fears of a prolonged recession grow . 
Richard Anderson , Delta 's chief executive , speaking on a conference call , said he 'd prefer a cooling economy over volatility in oil prices . 
`` You would rather not have either , right , but if you had to manage to one of them , having fuel dropping like a rock is a big offset to what happens in the economy , '' Anderson said . 
Anderson said Delta could always take `` quick , decisive action '' to reduce flights if demand soured . 
He and other executives said Delta was more insulated from the economic slowdown because most of the airline 's growth has taken place in flights to and from Africa and the Middle East , away from the New York-to-London air corridor . 
Some industry analysts see a gloomier period for the industry than company executives . 
In a note on Tuesday , the Business Travel Coalition predicted `` a lengthy period of marketplace volatility and dramatic changes to worldwide travel demand . '' ''

"A worker passes the Bank of England in London on Tuesday . 
-LRB- By Kirsty Wigglesworth -- Associated Press -RRB- We are living through the first financial crisis of this new global age . 
And the decisions we make will affect us over not just the next few weeks but for years to come . 
The global problems we face require global solutions . 
At the end of World War II , American and European visionaries built a new international economic order and formed the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and a world trade body . 
They acted because they knew that peace and prosperity were indivisible . 
They knew that for prosperity to be sustained , it had to be shared . 
Such was the impact of what they did for their day and age that Secretary of State Dean Acheson spoke of being `` present at the creation . '' 
Today , the same sort of visionary internationalism is needed to resolve the crises and challenges of a different age . 
And the greatest of global challenges demands of us the boldest of global cooperation . 
The old postwar international financial institutions are out of date . 
They have to be rebuilt for a wholly new era in which there is global , not national , competition and open , not closed , economies . 
International flows of capital are so big they can overwhelm individual governments . 
And trust , the most precious asset of all , has been eroded . 
When President Bush met with the Group of Seven finance ministers last weekend , they agreed that we all had to deal with not only the issue of liquidity in the banking system but also the capitalization and funding of banks . 
It was clear that national action alone would not have been sufficient . 
We knew we had to send a clear and unambiguous message to the markets that governments across the world were prepared to act in a coordinated manner and do whatever was necessary to stabilize the system and address the fundamental problems . 
Confidence about the future is vital to building confidence for today . 
We must deal with more than the symptoms of the current crisis . 
We have to tackle the root causes . 
So the next stage is to rebuild our fractured international financial system . 
This week , European leaders came together to propose the guiding principles that we believe should underpin this new Bretton Woods : transparency , sound banking , responsibility , integrity and global governance . 
We agreed that urgent decisions implementing these principles should be made to root out the irresponsible and often undisclosed lending at the heart of our problems . 
To do this , we need cross-border supervision of financial institutions ; shared global standards for accounting and regulation ; a more responsible approach to executive remuneration that rewards hard work , effort and enterprise but not irresponsible risk-taking ; and the renewal of our international institutions to make them effective early-warning systems for the world economy . 
Tomorrow , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Commission President Jos Manuel Barroso will meet with President Bush to discuss the urgent reforms of the international financial system that are crucial both to preventing another crisis and to restoring confidence , which is necessary to get banks back to their essential purpose -- maintaining the flow of money to individuals and businesses . 
The reforms I have outlined are vital to ensuring that globalization works not just for some but for all hard-pressed families and businesses in all our communities . 
It is important , too , that in the international leaders ' meeting that has been proposed we seek a world trade agreement and reject the beggar-thy-neighbor protectionism that has been a feature of past crises . 
There are no Britain-only or Europe-only or America-only solutions to today 's problems . 
We are all in this together , and we can only resolve this crisis together . 
Over the past week , we have shown that with political will it is possible to agree on a global multibillion-dollar package to recapitalize our banks across many continents . 
In the next few weeks , we need to show the same resolve and spirit of cooperation to create the rules for our new global economy . 
If we do this , 2008 will be remembered not just as a year of financial crisis but as the year we started to build the world anew .

"The Crash : What Went Wrong ? 
How did the most dynamic and sophisticated financial markets in the world come to the brink of collapse ? 
The Washington Post examines how Wall Street innovation outpaced Washington regulation . 
November : Congress passes law to dismantle Depression-era Glass-Steagall law , which had separated commercial and investment banking . 
The law does not give the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to regulate investment bank holding companies , which were trading heavily in unregulated derivatives contracts . 
November : A President 's Working Group report on derivatives recommended no CFTC regulation , saying that it `` would otherwise perpetuate legal uncertainty or impose unnecessary regulatory burdens and constraints upon the development of these markets in the United States . '' 
June : Born leaves the CFTC , with no change in the regulation of derivatives . 
December : Commodity Futures Modernization Act passes . 
Championed by Sen. Phil Gramm -LRB- R-Tex . -RRB- 
, the law bars the Securities and Exchange Commission , as well as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , from issuing new regulations on unregulated derivatives . 
April : The Securities and Exchange Commission creates a voluntary program of oversight for investment bank holding companies . 
It gives the SEC its first comprehensive look at the large trading positions the firms had in unregulated derivatives and mortgage-related securities . 
September : The Federal Reserve Bank of New York holds discussions with derivatives dealers on creating a voluntary clearinghouse for unregulated derivatives trades . 
September : Insurance giant AIG is seized by the federal government after it 's forced to scramble for cash to use as collateral for $ 440 billion in credit default swaps it sold . 
September : Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy protection after other financial firms demand cash to protect their positions . 
March : Bear Stearns is rescued by J.P. Morgan Chase and a $ 29 billion federal government loan after other financial firms question its stability and demand cash to protect their positions with the firm . 
Banking Regulator Played Advocate The Office of Thrift Supervision let lenders grow out of control , then fail , including IndyMac Bancorp , Washington Mutual and Downey Savings and Loan . 
The Frenzy When the housing market began to tank in 2005 , Wall Street ran through the yellow light of caution and created even riskier investments -- and Washington had no mechanism for finding out what was going on . 
Investigating AIG : The Beautiful Machine Greed on Wall Street and blindness in Washington certainly helped cause the financial system 's crash . 
But a deeper explanation begins 20 years ago with a bold experiment to master the variable that has defeated so many visionaries : Risk . 
Creating the Wave Low interest rates and easy credit allowed many Americans to live beyond their means . 
Riding the Crest Wall Street devised exotic securities to earn fees from the debt boom . 
Housing Values Overburdened by debt , a relatively small percentage of homeowners began missing mortgage payments , creating a domino effect that sent losses throughout financial markets .

"Ongoing Boeing Strike Poses Threat to Industry Around 27,000 Boeing workers are on strike . 
The firm has halted production , a move that affects thousands of other industry workers . 
-LRB- By Ted S. Warren -- Associated Press -RRB- If ever there was a company built to withstand the global financial crisis , Boeing might be it . 
The aerospace and defense giant is well diversified . 
The world 's airlines are lining up with orders for the company 's latest commercial jets . 
But Boeing 's prospects appear cloudy as a machinist strike enters its seventh week . 
Analysts say the strike , if not resolved soon , could make it difficult for the world 's largest aircraft manufacturer to weather the recession , weakening a giant of industrial America . 
Last week , the Federal Reserve said the Boeing strike contributed to the 2.8 percent decrease in industrial production in September , the steepest drop in 34 years . 
Crunching the figures , economists estimate the strike could be shaving as much as one-tenth of a percentage point from the nation 's gross domestic product . 
Already , the strike , launched in early September by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers , is affecting thousands of U.S. workers whose jobs are tied to Boeing 's production lines . 
`` My sense is that the impact is going to be much deeper than currently perceived , '' said Wolfgang Demisch , a veteran industry consultant . 
`` The world 's airlines are on a buying spree . 
All of this essentially relies on sustained global peace and prosperity . 
It also relies on the global availability of relatively inexpensive credit . '' 
Analysts estimate that Boeing has a six - or seven-year backlog of plane orders . 
The company 's newest model , the 787 or so-called Dreamliner , is the darling of the aviation world . 
American Airlines this week said it agreed to order as many as 100 new 787s over the next decade , which have a list price of $ 150 million to $ 200 million . 
But Boeing 's factories are shut down now due to the strike , and they are n't producing any new airplanes . 
Boeing is offering to boost salaries in current negotiations , but the company and the union have been unable to agree on outsourcing . 
The union wants to change contract provisions that allow Boeing to use outside companies to deliver parts inside plants . 
`` It 's a slippery slope , '' said Connie Kelliher , an IAM spokeswoman . 
`` If you allow employees from another company to do work that you 've traditionally done , people who bring in the engines will be asked to hang the engines . '' 
So far , it appears that both sides are digging in . 
Bargainers met last Sunday and Monday and adjourned without a new agreement . 
As of late yesterday , no talks were scheduled for this weekend . 
Analysts say the union has the upper hand as long as Boeing 's order books remain filled . 
Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx said that the company wants its employees back at work but that in these tough economic times , Boeing could not `` lock ourselves into any agreement that would n't allow us to conduct our business in the most efficient manner possible . '' 
About 27,000 IAM workers at Boeing are on strike . 
But the shutdown is affecting thousands of workers outside Boeing . 
In Wichita , Ernest Gonzales , a 52-year-old single father of two , works at Spirit AeroSystems , a Boeing contractor . 
Because of the strike , Gonzales and other workers have had their work schedules cut to three days a week . 
On Thursday , Gonzales joined other workers affected by the strike at a pro-union rally outside an IAM union lodge . 
Workers were being handed $ 25 and $ 50 food vouchers . 
At Spirit headquarters , workers say Boeing parts are piling up . 
Finished fuselages sit on railcars waiting for delivery to Boeing 's shuttered Pacific Northwest assembly hangars . 
Gonzales said Spirit workers are using sick days , vacation time and unemployment insurance to fill the gaps and assemble regular 40-hour paychecks . 
Jeff Turner , Spirit 's president and chief executive , sent out a memo Wednesday telling 10,500 workers that the company was preparing for an extended strike . 
A work stoppage beyond October could lead to broad shutdowns and temporary layoffs as early as mid-November , he wrote . 
`` We have to deal with that , '' Gonzales said . 
`` There 's concern about holiday pay and what type of Christmas we are going to have because most of us would be laid off out here . '' 
Demisch , the aerospace analyst , called the strike a `` tragedy '' that reflects years of poor labor relations at Boeing . 
He said if Boeing 's labor situation does n't improve , the American aerospace industry could go the way of the auto industry , with management and labor at loggerheads . 
`` It seems there is no learning taking place , '' Demisch said .

"President Bush returns a salute before boarding Marine One helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House , Friday , Oct. 17 , 2008 in Washington . 
-LRB- AP Photo\/Pablo Martinez Monsivais -RRB- -LRB- Pablo Martinez Monsivais - AP -RRB- President Bush , center , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , left , and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso arrive for a statement on the world economy at Camp David Saturday , Oct. 18 , 2008 in Camp David , Md. -LRB- AP Photo\/Evan Vucci -RRB- -LRB- Evan Vucci - AP -RRB- President Bush announced plans yesterday to host an emergency summit of leaders from the world 's top economies to map out a response to the global financial crisis , urging a renewed effort to secure the basis of `` democratic capitalism . '' 
The objectives set for the summit are every bit as far-reaching as those of the 1944 landmark meeting in Bretton Woods , N.H. , attended by 44 Allied nations to remake the global financial system after the Great Depression . 
But while that earlier gathering was devoted to coordinating monetary policy and setting up an international currency exchange system , the summit announced yesterday at Camp David would aim to overhaul the regulatory framework for global finance . 
The agenda would address a wide range of challenges such as increasing the transparency of markets , revising the rules that govern the flow of investment around the world and improving oversight of big banks , ratings agencies and hedge funds , a senior White House official said . 
Bush warned , however , that these reforms should not come at the expense of free markets . 
Any initiatives that come out of the summit would do little to ease the immediate situation as the meltdown in financial markets takes its increasing toll on livelihoods and living conditions . 
But the conclave could give Bush a chance to put his stamp on the global financial system before his term runs out . 
A joint statement issued after a meeting of Bush , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Commission President Jos Manuel Barroso at Camp David said the European Union , France and the United States had agreed to hold `` a series of summits on addressing the challenges facing the global economy , '' starting with one in the United States `` soon after the U.S. elections . '' 
The aim of the first summit would be to `` review progress '' in the current crisis and `` to seek agreement on principles of reform needed to avoid a repetition and assure global prosperity in the future , '' the statement said . 
Later summits would be held to implement whatever agreements were made at the first , according to the statement . 
The meetings would involve emerging economic powers previously excluded from similar talks as well as those that have dominated the global financial system over the last half century , White House officials said . 
They would be open to the major industrial states that comprise the Group of Eight -- the United States , Canada , Britain , France , Italy , Germany , Russia and Japan -- as well as leading developing nations such as China , India , and Brazil . 
Other countries that could be invited include Saudi Arabia , South Korea and Australia . 
`` As we make the regulatory institutional changes necessary to avoid a repeat of this crisis , it is essential that we preserve the foundations of democratic capitalism -- commitment to free markets , free enterprise and free trade , '' Bush said , flanked by Sarkozy and Barroso . 
`` We must resist the dangerous temptation of economic isolationism and continue the policies of open markets that have lifted standards of living and helped millions of people escape poverty around the world , '' Bush added . 
His announcement means that Bush , who has already presided over the largest U.S. intervention into the financial markets in 75 years , may also leave a lasting imprint on the structure of the world economy . 
But many of the key decisions are likely to be left for his successor . 
Sarkozy welcomed Bush 's announcement of a summit and said it could be held by the end of November . 
`` Since the crisis started in New York , maybe we can find the solution in New York , '' the French president said . 
Barroso , speaking at Camp David , agreed that a `` new global financial order '' was needed . 
But while there is active support within the Bush administration for coordinating with other governments on the response to banking crises , the United States and Europeans could find themselves in conflict over several issues . 
Leaders from the United States , European countries and other economic powers gathered in Geneva this summer but could n't agree on a range of issues , including strengthening the global regulatory framework and agricultural tariffs .

"Historians identify changes in eras in terms of decades , even centuries . 
Commentators are a much more impatient bunch : A few weeks of turmoil on Wall Street , a year of the credit crunch , and they 've formed an instant consensus that a new era has begun , that points have turned or tipped or gushed over a watershed . 
This consensus , on both sides of the Atlantic , has formed around four themes . 
One is the idea that the dividing line between the market and the state , between conservative economic thinking and progressive intervention , will now shift decisively away from the market . 
A second is that America 's status as a free-market beacon and provider of the dollar standard will decline sharply . 
A third idea is that this Western economic crisis is going to confirm , and probably accelerate , the shift in economic power to Asia , and in particular to China . 
And when you put those three themes together , you get a fourth : that authoritarian nations , where the state runs the economy and where the political leaders are instinctively hostile to America , are going to become stronger , both internally and as role models . 
The haste with which this agreement has been reached should make us suspicious . 
It 's time to wonder whether all four of these themes may be wrong . 
In fact , it 's time to wonder whether the ultimate consequence of this economic turmoil could be the precise opposite of what 's expected . 
Consider each of the agreed-upon themes in turn . 
The last big financial crisis -- in fact the biggest stock and real estate collapse -- to have occurred in any large industrial economy since 1929 was the one that began in Japan in 1990-91 . 
Did that lead to a decisive shift in the balance between the state and the market ? 
Yes , it did : It pushed Japan far more toward the market and away from state intervention and regulation . 
The reason , in part , was that the collapse destroyed the Japanese bureaucracy 's reputation . 
-LRB- In the United States , it is bankers ' reputations that have suffered , along with Alan Greenspan 's . -RRB- 
But the biggest reason was pragmatic : The cost of rescuing the financial system and supporting the economy was so high that it left the annual budget deeply in deficit . 
With gross government debt at 180 percent of GDP -LRB- Washington 's is now about 90 percent -RRB- there was little choice but to cut the state back . 
In the United States , the cost so far of recapitalizing the banks , taking control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and so on has been smaller than the Japanese expenditure : 5 percent or so of GDP here vs. 20 to 24 percent in Japan . 
That extra debt and a higher deficit will extend government , but it will also constrain other spending by the new administration and Congress . 
There will almost certainly be a fresh fiscal stimulus package after Jan. 20 , perhaps focusing on rebuilding infrastructure . 
But other projects will have to be put on hold . 
In the medium term , the net effect on the government 's financial role may turn out to be neutral , unless a potential President Obama succeeds in persuading Congress to finance his scheme for universal health care . 
In Europe , however , the extra debts and deficits being taken on in Britain , France , Germany and elsewhere are already larger than those in the United States and are being piled onto already overloaded public finances . 
There , the Japanese outcome is a real possibility : Rather than extend the state , these extra burdens could in fact give a powerful push to pro-market , state-trimming reform . 
Europe had already been moving in that direction under leaders such as Nicolas Sarkozy in France and Angela Merkel in Germany ; this crisis may well accelerate that process considerably . 
Yes , regulation of banking and other financial firms is likely to increase , as it has in Japan . 
But that is quite a technical matter of capital-adequacy rules and the treatment of derivative securities , not the stuff of new eras and paradigm shifts . 
What of the second theme , of a post-American world with a shrinking role for the dollar , analogous to the demise of sterling and of Britain 's economic and financial status after 1945 ? 
The first point to be made is that the dollar 's role in global foreign-exchange reserves was much smaller in 1990 -LRB- 50 percent of global reserves -RRB- than it is today -LRB- about 63 percent -RRB- , so even a fresh decline in its use would not be path-breaking . 
The second is to ask what the alternative is : the euro , the currency of a region that has gone into recession more quickly than the United States , and whose banks are just as troubled ? 
And not , certainly , China 's yuan , unless that country 's leaders are poised to surprise us all by making it convertible and reducing controls on capital flows , both of which are necessary before a currency can take on reserve status . 
By default , the dollar is likely to keep its leading role . 
Whether the United States will again be a beacon of economic policy and performance depends on how bad its recession proves to be and on how well it adjusts to a new period of higher household savings and lower consumption and debt . 
It depends , too , on how American politics respond to rising unemployment and whether Congress tries to move sharply away from fairly open trade and toward protectionism . 
That 's what happened in the recession of the 1980s . 
Membership in the new World Trade Organization will make that much harder , however , as will either a President Obama or a President McCain , both of whom profess to be multilateralists . 
China will certainly be an issue for the new Congress and administration : Its extraordinary current-account surplus of 10 percent of GDP , its slowing but still rapid growth -LRB- down to `` just '' 10 percent a year from 12.9 percent -RRB- , its accumulation of capital in its sovereign investment funds could all provoke resentment , envy and fear . 
But will its global status and role really , as the third theme claims , be strengthened by this Western economic crisis ? 
It could be : If China 's leaders were to abide by Western recommendations and revalue the yuan while also increasing public spending to stimulate the domestic economy , the country could become a crucial source of import demand for the world . 
That , however , requires China 's domestic interests to become neatly aligned with global interests , for it is those internal interests with which its leadership is principally concerned . 
And even reflation and revaluation would not make China an American-style buyer of last resort , because its economy is German-size , not American-size -- $ 3.2 trillion as opposed to $ 13.8 trillion for the United States . 
Moreover , China 's leadership has other preoccupations besides seeking loftier global status . 
Thanks to its capital controls , its savings surplus and its state-controlled banking system , China is well insulated from the Western financial crisis -LRB- unlike India , where companies ' foreign debts are high and private banks are getting squeezed -RRB- . 
Its low-end exporters , however -- cheap labor and high-volume industries such as toys and textiles -- are already in trouble due to both rising wages and a higher valuation for the yuan since 2005 . 
Other export industries now look set to lose business as Western markets shrink . 
Meanwhile , public concern about pollution , combined with political fears about dependency on imported resources , is bringing about a new emphasis on efficiency and , to some extent , tighter environmental controls . 
"
"The financial crisis is by no means over , but the urge to extract lessons from it already is irresistible . 
The Europeans have pressed successfully for a new Bretton Woods summit , modeled after the 1944 gathering that inoculated the world against a repeat of the Great Depression . 
Although the original Bretton Woods took place years after the Depression , Britain and France are bent on staging the new version within weeks . 
`` Europe wants it . 
Europe will get it , '' French President Nicolas Sarkozy said before jetting off to Camp David , where President Bush meekly gave in to him . 
The Bretton Woods analogy is contrived , to put it mildly . 
That summit created the World Bank to reconstruct Europe after the ravages of World War II . 
Today , bombed-out infrastructure is hardly the issue . 
Bretton Woods also created the International Monetary Fund , to support a system of fixed exchange rates . 
But the world has largely abandoned that system , and today 's chief exchange-rate challenge is to move even further from Bretton Woods by persuading China to float its currency . 
Bretton Woods boosters assert that a global financial system needs global regulatory fixes . 
This claim deserves scrutiny . 
The fix that rightly commands widest support is moving the swap contracts between financial institutions onto centralized exchanges , so the collapse of one large player does not threaten others that entered into swaps with it . 
But this reform can be achieved with a minimum of international coordination . 
Countries can unilaterally establish swaps exchanges , and financial institutions all over the world can use them . 
The second fix on most reformers ' lists is to shrink the pyramids of debt in the financial system . 
When a bank or a hedge fund buys $ 100 million of assets with $ 5 million in capital and $ 95 million in debt , a 5 percent loss is enough to wipe it out , forcing liquidation of the remaining $ 95 million worth of stocks or bonds in its portfolio . 
Such fire-sale liquidation has driven part of the recent market turmoil ; it forces prices down and damages other debt-laden players , which then join in the selling . 
Although such debt , or `` leverage , '' is certainly dangerous , a new Bretton Woods summit is not going to tame it . 
We know this because we 've tried already . 
It took five years , not a handful of photo-op summits , to negotiate the so-called Basel II standards that govern leverage at banks , and the resulting deal proved ineffectual anyway . 
Daniel Tarullo , who has just published a Peterson Institute book on Basel , points out that the next attempt to control leverage may need to be broader . 
After the events of recent months , that is surely right . 
Given AIG 's failure , the next round should probably encompass insurers . 
Given the vast growth of hedge funds , it should also cover some of them . 
Creating sensible leverage rules for such disparate institutions will be fiendishly complex , perhaps even impossible . 
So what might a new Bretton Woods conference usefully do ? 
Well , it could reform the IMF , which has evolved from its original role into a rescue fund for collapsing currencies . 
During the emerging market crises of a decade ago , the IMF was central to all the bailouts . 
Its status has since dwindled . 
As my Council on Foreign Relations colleague Brad Setser notes , the Chinese have tried to muscle in on the IMF 's turf by helping Pakistan . 
The Russians have tried to help Iceland . 
The European Union has helped Hungary . 
Reestablishing the IMF as the agreed provider of bailouts would be a worthwhile project . 
The IMF puts economic conditions on its loans while governments place political ones ; we do n't want to revive the cronyism of the Cold War , when countries from Cuba to Zaire could pursue absurd policies and know they would be bailed out because they were strategically useful . 
The irony is that Britain and France will be the first to resist a serious effort to revive the IMF . 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown talks vacuously about giving the organization the role of creating an early-warning system for crises , even though this is what thousands of economic forecasters already try to provide . 
What Brown does not stress is that serious IMF reform needs to begin with the modernization of its board . 
Rising powers such as China and India deserve more say . 
Declining powers need to give up some influence -- and that includes France and Britain . 
Of course there is a role for global cooperation . 
The coordinated interest rate cuts and bank rescues of recent days have been constructive . 
But it 's worth remembering that after the last global crisis , in 1997-98 , there was lots of grand talk about a new international financial architecture . 
In the end , the only important reforms were national ones . 
Governments ran budget surpluses and built up foreign reserves to protect themselves from the next shock . 
That shock has arrived , and we are about to find out if those changes were enough . 
One thing is certain : They were not the result of any international conference .

"Sen. John McCain meets with local business leaders at Buckingham Smokehouse Bar-B-Q in Columbia , Mo. -LRB- By Ricky Carioti -- The Washington Post -RRB- BELTON , Mo. , Oct. 20 -- Battling George W. Bush for the GOP presidential nomination in 2000 , John McCain lashed out at the Texas governor , denouncing his proposed tax cuts as a giveaway to the rich . 
Eight years later , this time running as the Republican presidential nominee , the senator from Arizona is again criticizing Bush and his financial policies , as he renews his efforts to demonstrate that he would represent a departure from the current administration . 
At virtually every campaign stop , McCain is reprising a line he used last Wednesday in his final debate with Sen. Barack Obama : `` I am not George Bush . '' 
And in a television ad introduced last week , McCain looks into the camera and says , `` The last eight years have n't worked very well , have they ? '' 
As he struggles to pull his campaign out from beneath the shadow of a president whose approval ratings have reached historic lows , McCain is offering some of his toughest criticism of the Bush White House . 
In recent weeks , he has focused his message on the administration 's handling of the nation 's financial crisis , suggesting that the Treasury Department has been more interested in `` bailing out the banks '' than helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure . 
`` I am so disturbed that this administration has not done what we have to do , and that is to go out and buy up these bad mortgages , '' McCain told Jewish leaders in a conference call Sunday morning . 
The new rhetoric has drawn roars of applause at some campaign stops and represents a tacit acknowledgment that McCain has not distanced himself sufficiently from the administration in his bid . 
One senior adviser said the campaign had to do something to counteract the Obama operation 's decision to spend `` tens of millions of dollars pushing '' the idea that McCain is a virtual clone of Bush . 
`` The majority of the swing voters do n't believe it , but some do , and we have to convince them that we are different from Bush , '' said this adviser , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss campaign strategy . 
Bush is hardly the only problem for McCain as he struggles to close a gap with Obama . 
Voters perceive Obama as better prepared to handle the economic crisis , the GOP brand has been severely tarnished in recent years , and McCain is at a huge financial disadvantage . 
But with the Republican president 's approval ratings languishing , the perceived connection with him is a significant drag on the party 's nominee . 
Nearly half of all voters in a new Washington Post-ABC News poll said McCain would mainly carry on Bush 's policies , and among those who would consider a McCain presidency as a continuation of the current administration , 90 percent support Obama . 
And the prized independent voters who link McCain and Bush also overwhelmingly tilt toward the Democrat . 
McCain has made progress in distancing himself from the president . 
Among independents , 54 percent now see the senator as offering a new direction , up from 44 percent before the third presidential debate , where he introduced his new language on Bush . 
Among all likely voters , the percentage associating McCain with Bush is less than 50 percent for the first time , albeit barely , at 49 percent . 
Forty-eight percent said McCain would mainly continue to lead in Bush 's footsteps . 
A senior Republican close to the campaign said internal GOP polling underscores those findings . 
`` It 's night and day , '' the source said . 
`` You have somebody whose public approval is in the 20s . 
There 's just not a ` there ' there anymore in terms of residual support . '' 
"
"INEVITABLY , PERHAPS , the deepening financial crisis has spawned a search for scapegoats and quick fixes . 
According to many Republican members of Congress , banking industry lobbyists and financial pundits , the Wall Street meltdown would not be nearly as bad as it is but for the baleful impact of `` mark-to-market '' accounting rules . 
These are national standards , adopted in the wake of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s , that require banks to carry certain financial assets on their books at the current market price . 
The idea is to give investors the latest and most objective estimate of a company 's true financial condition -- as opposed to a company 's inevitably self-serving calculation based on original costs . 
Now that the markets for mortgage-backed securities and derivatives have seized up , however , their market price is either distressingly close to zero or impossible to determine . 
Critics argue that marking-to-market when there is no market artificially and irrationally depresses banks ' balance sheets , since the assets would fetch near face-value under normal circumstances . 
Ergo , they contend , the way to shore up bank capital is to relax or eliminate mark-to-market -- and it would n't cost taxpayers a dime . 
The critics have a point . 
Undoubtedly the markets , out of irrational fear , are shunning some relatively solid assets as well as actual turkeys . 
Mark-to-market therefore does force banks to write their books in the panicky language of today 's meltdown . 
Perhaps , once the crisis is over , it would be wise for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the accounting authorities to revisit this `` pro-cyclical '' aspect of the rule . 
The recent bailout legislation included a provision requiring the SEC to study mark-to-market 's impact . 
We see no harm in that . 
But the critics ' arguments against mark-to-market may prove too much . 
If the rule requires banks to accentuate the negative during bust times , then presumably it is also to blame for all those wonderful financial statements the banks were issuing during the boom . 
We do n't recall anyone demanding its suspension then . 
Actually , complaints about the rule probably overstate its impact , since financial institutions only have to use it for securities they intend to trade . 
Loans and securities held to maturity are not covered by mark-to-market ; at big banks such as SunTrust , Wells Fargo and Bank of America , such long-term assets represent half or more of all assets . 
Markets not only need transparent financial reporting , they need consistent financial reporting . 
To suspend or abandon mark-to-market now , in the middle of a panic , would simply deepen the confusion and suspicion that are already crippling the financial system . 
No , today 's financial meltdown is not some accidental byproduct of misguided technical rules . 
It happened because too many firms made too many bad financial bets with borrowed money . 
Pretending otherwise wo n't solve anything .

"On Al-Qaeda Web Sites , Joy Over U.S. Crisis , Support for McCain Al-Qaeda is watching the U.S. stock market 's downward slide with something akin to jubilation , with its leaders hailing the financial crisis as a vindication of its strategy of crippling America 's economy through endless , costly foreign wars against Islamist insurgents . 
And at least some of its supporters think Sen. John McCain is the presidential candidate best suited to continue that trend . 
`` Al-Qaeda will have to support McCain in the coming election , '' said a commentary posted Monday on the extremist Web site al-Hesbah , which is closely linked to the terrorist group . 
It said the Arizona Republican would continue the `` failing march of his predecessor , '' President Bush . 
The Web commentary was one of several posted by Taliban or al-Qaeda-allied groups in recent days that trumpeted the global financial crisis and predicted further decline for the United States and other Western powers . 
In language that was by turns mocking and ominous , the newest posting credited al-Qaeda with having lured Washington into a trap that had `` exhausted its resources and bankrupted its economy . '' 
It further suggested that a terrorist strike might swing the election to McCain and guarantee an expansion of U.S. military commitments in the Islamic world . 
`` It will push the Americans deliberately to vote for McCain so that he takes revenge for them against al-Qaeda , '' said the posting , attributed to Muhammad Haafid , a longtime contributor to the password-protected site . 
`` Al-Qaeda then will succeed in exhausting America . '' 
It was unclear how closely the commentary reflected the views of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , who has not issued a public statement since the spring . 
Some terrorism experts said the support for McCain could be mere bluster by a group that may have more to fear from a McCain presidency . 
In any event , the comments summarized what has emerged as a consensus view on extremist sites , said Adam Raisman , a senior analyst for the Site Intelligence Group , which monitors Islamist Web pages . 
Site provided translations of the comments to The Washington Post . 
`` The idea in the jihadist forums is that McCain would be a faithful ` son of Bush ' -- someone they see as a jingoist and a war hawk , '' Raisman said . 
`` They think that , to succeed in a war of attrition , they need a leader in Washington like McCain . '' 
Islamist militants have generally had less to say about Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois . 
Leaders of the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah expressed a favorable view of Obama during the primary campaign but later rejected the Democrat after he delivered speeches expressing support for Israel . 
In an e-mail response , senior McCain foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann noted that al-Qaeda leaders have repeatedly said that America `` did not have the stomach to fight them over the long haul , '' which the Arizona senator has pledged to do . 
`` Whatever musings and bravado on radical websites the Washington Post chooses to quote , the fact remains that only John McCain has the experience , judgment and fortitude to lead a country at war , '' he said . 
The Obama campaign declined to comment on the Web postings . 
Both the Bush administration and the two major presidential campaigns have rejected any suggestion that the economic downturn will undermine the country 's fight against al-Qaeda . 
Obama and McCain have stepped gingerly around the issue of how they would adjust their priorities in a recession and have spoken of the importance of maintaining a strong defense . 
Both have advocated expanding the size of the U.S. military overall , but neither has explained in detail how to pay for it . 
From shortly after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , al-Qaeda attacks to last year , U.S. defense spending rose from 3 to 4 percent of gross domestic product , but it remains far below the 45-year average of 5.5 percent . 
The Pentagon 's budget for fiscal 2009 is $ 527 billion , a figure that does not include Iraq and Afghanistan war costs , which have totaled more than $ 800 billion since 2001 . 
`` History shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy , '' McCain said this month . 
He has said the United States must send more troops to Afghanistan while avoiding a withdrawal timetable from Iraq .

"Fearing a Drought of Aid Flood victims in Haiti carried sacks of rice from international aid organization CARE . 
Bush has argued against cutting such aid amid the global financial crisis . 
-LRB- By Ariana Cubillos -- Associated Press -RRB- President Bush , who has made international aid a cornerstone of his foreign policy , warned yesterday against cutting U.S. assistance to impoverished nations in the midst of the financial turmoil sweeping Wall Street and Main Street , arguing that doing so would undermine America 's economy , national security and moral authority . 
`` During times of economic crisis , some may be tempted to turn inward -- focusing on our problems here at home , while ignoring our interests around the world , '' Bush said at a White House summit on international development in Washington . 
`` This would be a serious mistake . 
America is committed , and America must stay committed , to international development for reasons that remain true regardless of the ebb and flow of the markets . '' 
The remarks came as fears grew that the financial crisis could further harm developing nations already whipsawed by surging food and energy prices over the past two years . 
The United Nations estimates that , even before the market crisis , rising food prices had pushed an additional 75 million people into chronic hunger , bringing the total to 925 million after years of decline . 
Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said in an interview yesterday that her country , and others in Africa , were feeling the pinch of the global economic crisis . 
Foreign investors battered in their home countries , she said , were scaling back plans to build a massive palm oil plantation and factory . 
A major London-based mining company , she added , is behind schedule on a $ 1.5 billion plan to extract iron ore and build roads . 
`` That 's going to have a major impact on the poor , '' she said . 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made a pitch for preserving foreign aid at yesterday 's conference . 
`` Some will ask the inevitable question in these troubled times : ` How can we afford it ? ' '' 
`` I would ask instead , ` How can we not afford it ? ' '' 
Even before the recent crisis , Western largesse was waning . 
The Bush administration , which has garnered accolades for dramatic increases in U.S. international aid programs , cut its foreign aid in 2007 by 3.5 percent , to $ 21.7 billion , according to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . 
`` Developing countries have been making real progress , so this is a real setback , '' said David Beckmann , president of Bread for the World , a Christian advocacy group . 
`` The one piece of good news from the last eight years is that the world has made real progress against poverty , and the U.S. has been quite good in this area . '' 
The two major U.S. presidential candidates , Sens. John McCain -LRB- R-Ariz . -RRB- 
and Barack Obama -LRB- D-Ill . -RRB- 
, have suggested that the financial crisis would not curtail their ambitions for foreign aid . 
Obama has vowed to more than double the annual outlay for international aid , to $ 50 billion , while McCain has focused on reforming the bureaucracy that doles out U.S. assistance . 
Obama spokeswoman Wendy Morigi said that if elected president , Obama would likely `` extend the time period '' for meeting his $ 50 billion aid target . 
`` The current financial crisis , along with the $ 700 billion recovery package , will clearly put short-term pressure on our budget , '' she said . 
McCain has not put a dollar amount on foreign assistance , but he is committed to using both public and private money to pay for increased aid , according to Richard Fontaine , McCain 's senior foreign policy adviser . 
`` We are going through tough economic times , and we have to take that into consideration , '' he said . 
`` But we are also a generous country . ''

Thursday , October 23 , 2008 ; Page A01 Employers are moving to aggressively cut jobs and reduce costs in the face of the nation 's economic crisis , preparing for what many fear will be a long and painful recession . 
The labor market has been weak all year , with a slow drip of workers losing their jobs each month . 
But the deterioration of the job market is now emerging as a driver of economic distress , according to a wide range of data and anecdotal reports from corporate America . 
In September , there were more mass layoffs -- instances in which employers slashed 50 or more jobs at one time -- than in any month since September 2001 , the Labor Department said yesterday . 
And nearly half a million Americans have filed new claims for unemployment benefits in each of the past four weeks , the highest rate of such claims since just after the terrorist attacks seven years ago . 
Anecdotal reports suggest that the hemorrhaging in the job market has only begun . 
Companies that announced plans this week to cut jobs include Internet company Yahoo -LRB- 1,500 positions -RRB- , pharmaceutical company Merck -LRB- 7,200 -RRB- , National City bank -LRB- 4,000 -RRB- and Comcast , the cable company -LRB- 300 -RRB- . 
The weakening employment outlook is part of the reason that investors have become more fearful of a deep , prolonged recession -- fears that led to yet another miserable day on Wall Street yesterday , with the Dow Jones industrial average down 514 points , or 5.7 percent . 
`` The customers I 've spoken to are all living under a sense of fear , '' said Paul Villella , chief executive of HireStrategy , a Reston company that matches employers and workers . 
`` They have very limited visibility into the future and have a great degree of uncertainty , so they just want to sit steady and be conservative in hiring . '' 
Villella and others who work with employers said that for many companies , the pullback in hiring is not a direct result of tightening credit . 
Rather , firms simply do n't know whether their own customers will be affected by the financial crisis ; as a result , they want to hold their breath and delay hiring decisions until they have a better sense of the future . 
The nation has shed jobs every month this year , but at a slower overall pace than in past economic downturns . 
The slide accelerated in late summer , with declines similar to those in past recessions . 
Last month , employers shed 159,000 jobs , the most this year and more than the average number of monthly job losses in the terrible labor markets of 2001 and 2002 . 
More obscure indicators monitored by economists at the Federal Reserve and in the private sector also show an inflection point in late summer . 
For example , employers had 214,000 fewer job openings in August than in July , according to a Labor Department report . 
Over the past year , the number of openings dropped by a more modest average of 74,000 per month . 
Indeed , many companies are imposing hiring freezes . 
Such moves do n't often get the kind of headlines that layoffs do , but because they shrink the number of places people can turn to for jobs , they still hurt the economy . 
VMware , a Palo Alto , Calif. , software company , is one firm that has curbed hiring . 
Earlier this week , after reporting third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street 's expectations , VMware told analysts on a conference call that despite a 32 percent jump in revenue , a `` hiring pause '' had been imposed for all jobs except critical ones . 
`` We are just being conservative , '' VMware spokeswoman Mary Ann Gallo said yesterday . 
The nation 's unemployment rate was 6.1 percent last month , not astronomical by historical standards . 
But the rate was up from 5 percent in April , and many forecasters now expect it to hit 7 percent or more by the end of this downturn . 
The construction and manufacturing sectors have been losing jobs for more than a year . 
But lately , job losses have begun or accelerated in a wide range of other fields . 
Retailers , stung by less consumer spending , cut 87,000 jobs in the three months ended in September . 
Employment services shed 100,000 positions in that span , reflecting the fact that companies are slashing temporary jobs . 
The leisure and hospitality industry cut 51,000 jobs , as people had less money to stay in hotels and eat in restaurants . 
In the greater Los Angeles area , Manpower , one of the nation 's largest temp agencies , has noticed a steady increase in job seekers since early September . 
Paul Holley , a spokesman for the company , said there are more applicants for fewer openings and better-qualified candidates seeking work . 
What 's particularly noteworthy , Holley said , is what 's happening in Phoenix . 
Job applications have held steady , but since September more applicants have had backgrounds in general labor and warehouse distribution . 
That 's unusual because warehouse and logistics jobs usually hold steady in the fall to support retailing for holiday shopping . 
Randstad USA , another large temp agency , reports that job applications are up in the Tucson area and that the firm is even getting inquires from people who still have jobs . 
`` In general , a lot of people seem to be insecure about their current jobs even if they are still employed , '' said Emily Cline , Randstad 's area vice president for Tucson . 
As reports of layoffs continue to pile up around the country , executives at Randstad said they have noticed a shift in psychology among job seekers . 
`` Employees are much more willing to work extra hours and to take on additional duties to enhance job security and improve their employability , '' said Eric Buntin , managing director for marketing and operations at Randstad . 
`` In a changing market , they know that 's a valuable resource . '' 
They are also willing to make less money , even as the cost of living goes up . 
Cline said some call center jobs that were paying $ 9 an hour in the Tucson area last year are now paying $ 8.50 . 
`` Their option becomes to take the job or not have the job , '' she said . 
With workers losing their leverage to negotiate raises , there could be greater downward pressure on wages , which in turn could drive down overall economic growth . 
Workers are already having a hard time getting raises ; inflation-adjusted pay for non-managerial workers fell 1.9 percent in the year ended in September , according to the Labor Department .

"Iranian Gholam Reza Karimi works in Azadegan oil field . 
With the drop in prices , Iran is struggling to finance oil and gas development projects . 
-LRB- By Vahid Salemi -- Associated Press -RRB- Despite huge domestic outlays , Hugo Ch vez said Venezuela , with $ 40 billion in central bank reserves , is secure . 
Vladimir Putin built up a reserve by taxing oil profits , but Russia dipped into it for bank rescues . 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wo n't say how much Iran has in reserve . 
-LRB- Ng Han Guan - AP -RRB- An oil worker in Saudi Arabia , which has dipped into its cash hoards to rescue domestic financial institutions . 
-LRB- By Hasan Jamali -- Associated Press -RRB- The world 's petro-powers -- the oil-exporting nations armed with vast , high-priced crude reserves -- are looking a little less imposing now that prices are tumbling . 
Instead of flexing their financial muscle abroad , cash-rich oil exporters have been forced to bolster institutions at home , spending billions of dollars to prop up banks , currencies , stock markets and other aspects of their economies . 
Around the world , oil price shock has given way to aftershock . 
Yesterday , crude oil prices briefly touched a 16-month low before closing at $ 67.84 a barrel , up $ 1.09 but less than half their July peak as traders worried that a global economic slowdown will shrink demand for petroleum products . 
For oil exporters , the price decline has compounded the global financial crisis . 
Kazakhstan has raided its once sacrosanct national oil fund to bolster banks that borrowed from abroad ; Iran , which drained much of its rainy day fund to pump up its economy even before oil prices fell , is now having trouble financing oil and gas development projects ; Venezuela might run a deficit to pay for massive social spending ; Mexico has spent billions of dollars defending the peso ; and Russia , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have dipped into their cash hoards to rescue domestic financial institutions . 
The sudden change in fortune will dominate the agenda at today 's emergency meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ; the 13-member cartel that is expected to slash output by 1 million to 2 million barrels a day to stop the slide in oil prices . 
`` The meeting this week shows they 're concerned and they need to micromanage -LRB- output -RRB- some more , '' said Fareed Mohamedi , head of country strategies at PFC Energy , a Washington consulting firm . 
To members of OPEC , this moment recalls the Asian financial crisis in 1997 , when the oil cartel increased production to ease international economic pressures only to see oil prices collapse . 
Now , in a new economic crisis , OPEC members will only be debating how big a cutback is needed . 
There is , however , no need to pass the tin cup for oil exporting countries , analysts note . 
The six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council have $ 2 trillion of financial reserves . 
Russia 's and Kazakhstan 's financial reserves are big enough , for now , to stave off the kind of crisis that shook both nations in 1998 . 
Even populous and impoverished Nigeria has paid off foreign debts and built up reserves . 
Moreover , the average oil price has still been higher than in the previous year , according to OPEC . 
Kuwait 's finance ministry said last week that it had collected $ 54 billion in revenue in the first half of the year , more than it had anticipated for the entire year . 
The spike in prices has also happened so quickly that oil exporting nations have n't had time to raise the price assumptions used for spending plans . 
The Saudi 2008 budget assumes prices between $ 40 and $ 45 a barrel . 
`` Many of these countries were much more prudent than they were in past , '' said Robin West , chairman of PFC Energy . 
As a result , he said , most oil exporters `` are still in pretty good cash positions for now . '' 
The biggest exceptions are Iran and Venezuela , two of the Bush administration 's main adversaries .

"Alan Greenspan , once viewed as the infallible architect of U.S. prosperity , was called on the carpet yesterday , pilloried by a congressional committee for decisions that contributed to the financial crisis devastating world markets . 
The former chairman of the Federal Reserve said the crisis had shaken his very understanding of how markets work , and agreed that certain financial derivatives should be regulated -- an idea he had long resisted . 
When he stepped down as Fed chairman less than three years ago , Congress treated Greenspan as an oracle , one of the great economic statesmen of all time . 
Yesterday , many members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee treated him as a hostile witness . 
`` You found that your view of the world , your ideology was not right , it was not working ? '' 
said Rep. Henry A. Waxman -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- 
, the committee chairman . 
`` Absolutely , precisely , '' Greenspan said . 
`` You know , that 's precisely the reason I was shocked , because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well . '' 
Greenspan alternately defended his legacy and acknowledged mistakes . 
Waxman asked whether the former chairman was wrong to consistently oppose regulating the multitrillion dollar derivative market that has contributed to the financial crisis . 
`` Well , partially , '' said Greenspan , before stressing the difference between credit-default swaps and other types of derivatives . 
With the global financial system unraveling , economists and political leaders are coming to doubt some of Greenspan 's most closely held views : that markets can exact self-discipline , that central bankers should generally not try to prick bubbles in the price of houses or tech stocks , that a policymaker 's most powerful tool to encourage growth is to stay out of the way . 
Even Greenspan seemed genuinely perplexed yesterday by all that had happened , hard-pressed to explain how formerly fundamental truths about how markets work could have proved so wrong . 
Members of Congress who not long ago would seek Greenspan 's blessing for their preferred public policies were at turns combative and disdainful . 
Rep. John Yarmuth -LRB- D-Ky . -RRB- 
called him a `` Bill Buckner , '' referring to the Boston Red Sox first baseman who missed an easy ground ball against the Mets in the 1986 World Series , costing the team the game . 
The tough talk reflected a widening sense that some of Greenspan 's apparent successes in managing the economy from 1987 to 2006 were in fact illusory , that they came at the cost of building the biggest credit bubble in world history . 
`` Markets and societies move on belief systems , '' said James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer and a longtime critic of Greenspan . 
`` The belief system of finance featured the notion that someone with unusual power to see around corners and through walls and into the future was running things , and that someone was Alan Greenspan . ''

"Hedge funds seemed unstoppable during the boom years , lavishing riches upon their investors and managers alike . 
Now that those riches are quickly disappearing , some analysts are blaming them for propagating the high-risk culture that led to the crisis on Wall Street . 
We try to shed some light on the hedge fund industry . 
Q : What are hedge funds and how do they operate ? 
A : They are private investment funds open to a limited number of people or institutions that can afford to invest a minimum amount of money . 
Think of them as mutual funds for the wealthy . 
But unlike mutual funds , they do n't have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission because they are not sold to the public . 
That means they can sell short , leverage , and undertake all sorts of complicated trading strategies . 
They are also run by managers who typically get paid higher fees and get a bigger take of profits than other types of fund managers . 
`` What they really should be called are unregistered funds for wealthy people , '' said John Rekenthaler , vice president of research for Morningstar . 
They were named hedge funds because they were supposed do just that : hedge their investments through a variety of methods such as taking both long and short positions . 
But in recent years , many hedge funds have been doing less hedging and actually adopting riskier practices to maximize rewards . 
Specifically , some have been leveraging themselves excessively -- investing with borrowed money . 
`` As we know , leverage increases returns but it does the same thing in reverse , maybe faster , '' said Duncan Balsbaugh , a senior market analyst for Thomson Reuters , IFR Markets . 
Q : Why do hedge funds matter so much ? 
A : Even though the hedge fund industry is n't as massive as the mutual fund industry , it still packs a big punch because each hedge fund operates with such a large sum of money . 
According to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research , capital in global hedge funds was $ 1.72 trillion at the end of September -LRB- that was down from $ 1.93 trillion at the end of June -RRB- . 
So when one hedge fund pulls money out of the market , it tends to be a big chunk . 
Their moves also tend to be made with dramatic flair . 
`` They 're active traders compared to mutual funds , '' Rekenthaler said . 
`` They can have a larger influence regardless of their size because they trade more aggressively . '' 
Q : What is their role in the market turmoil going on now ? 
A : Hedge funds made risky bets and like many other investors , they are paying for it . 
Spooked investors are responding by pulling out their money . 
In the third quarter of 2008 , they withdrew $ 31 billion , according to HFR . 
The funds have to find cash to meet these so-called redemption requests . 
They do so by selling their assets . 
Right now , they are doing just that , which is contributing to the stock market volatility . 
`` They 're moving from an aggressive stance to a conservative stance , selling securities and knocking down the price of those securities , '' Rekenthaler said . 
Q : How much are they to blame for the global financial crisis ? 
A : It 's hard to say because they operate under a veil of secrecy . 
`` The problem is nobody knows for sure how much money they hold and where their money is invested and how significantly they 're leveraged , '' said Jeff Fischer , lead adviser for Motley Fool . 
But they are not the only ones selling stocks . 
Many panicked investors , big and small , are following suit . 
Many analysts also said it would be unfair to single out hedge funds for doing risky things such as overleveraging themselves . 
Those now-defunct investment banks and other financial institutions are guilty as well . 
That said , they could probably use more oversight , said John Jacquemin , chief executive of Mooring Financial Corp. , which has a hedge fund . 
`` It 's the Wild West out there , '' he said . ''

-LRB- By Ron Schwane -- Associated Press -RRB- CLEVELAND -- This city 's biggest bank and a bedrock institution decided it faced a choice a decade ago : Find a way to grow or risk takeover . 
National City chose growth , a path that ended yesterday when it agreed to sell itself to Pittsburgh 's PNC . 
When it abandoned the conservative philosophy that had sustained it through the Civil War and the Great Depression and expanded by wading into the subprime mortgage market , National City was a solid company , its shares selling in the $ 30 range . 
Yesterday , PNC Financial Services Group agreed to buy the bank for $ 5.2 billion in PNC stock , paying $ 2.23 per National City share , and $ 384 million in cash . 
Cleveland is still home to another large regional lender , KeyCorp , but the loss of one such venerable institution was a blow to the city and is emblematic of the way the financial crisis is rippling through communities . 
Cleveland 's prospects had soared with property values during the mortgage boom earlier this decade , then collapsed in the subprime meltdown . 
Last year alone , 8,000 homes went into foreclosure in the city , whose population has shrunk below 450,000 . 
With tax collections shriveling and a recession looming , the city is in its worst shape in years . 
Mayor Frank G. Jackson -LRB- D -RRB- likened the impending departure of National City , with more than 7,000 employees in the region , to the loss of a steel mill or other major employer , as well as a stalwart corporate citizen that has been engaged in almost every philanthropic endeavor in the city . 
`` It 's not good news for Cleveland , '' he said yesterday . 
`` However , it is not news that we did not think may happen . '' 
When National City was trying to figure out how to expand in the mid-1990s , Cleveland was dormant , its population sliding and its vital industries contracting . 
Banks were reluctant lenders , and in many neighborhoods , it was nearly impossible to get a mortgage . 
At the time , the mortgage business accounted for only 5 percent of the bank 's profit . 
All of that changed when National City decided to turbocharge its earnings by going deeper into the riskier parts of the mortgage business . 
The bank began working more closely with mortgage brokers to bring in more business from faster-growing parts of the country . 
In 1999 , it bought the California-based subprime lender First Franklin . 
By 2003 , the bank was the nation 's sixth-largest mortgage lender , and home loans accounted for about half of its $ 2.1 billion in profit . 
In Cleveland 's old neighborhoods , property values began to soar . 
Wood-frame houses built nearly a century ago were fetching $ 70,000 , $ 80,000 and even $ 90,000 -- multiples of their previous peaks . 
Tax revenue accelerated , punctuating Cleveland 's claim as a comeback city . 
National City got in on what turned out to be a national boom , as it rapidly expanded its mortgage business into the fast-growing Sun Belt and ventured deeply into the subprime lending market . 
For a time , the strategy was wildly profitable , as the bank reported profit of more than $ 13 billion from 2000 to 2006 . 
And then the boom fizzled , leaving both the bank and its home town faltering . 
Overall , nearly 10 percent of the city 's properties have gone into foreclosure . 
National City has lost more than 80 percent of its market value this year . 
On Tuesday , chief executive Peter E. Raskind said 4,000 positions would be eliminated from its overall workforce of 29,000 over the next three years . 
The bank slashed 3,400 jobs a year earlier . 
The cuts were announced as the bank posted a third-quarter loss of $ 729 million -- its fifth consecutive quarterly decline -- and executives set aside precious capital to cushion it against expected losses from its bulging portfolio of toxic loans .

"Financial Meltdown Worsens Food Crisis `` The global financial crisis should not make us forget the food crisis , '' Food and Agriculture Organization head says . 
-LRB- By Lai Seng Sin -- Associated Press -RRB- SHANGHAI -- As shock waves from the credit crisis began to spread around the world last month , China scrambled to protect itself . 
Among the most extreme measures it took was to impose new export taxes to keep critical supplies such as grains and fertilizer from leaving the country . 
About 5,700 miles away , in Nairobi , farmer Stephen Muchiri is suffering the consequences . 
It 's planting season now , but he can afford to sow amaranthus and haricot beans on only half of the 10 acres he owns because the cost of the fertilizer he needs has shot up nearly $ 50 a bag in a matter of weeks . 
Muchiri said nearly everyone he knows is cutting back on planting , which means even less food for a continent where the supply has already been weakened by drought , political unrest and rising prices . 
While the world 's attention has been focused on rescuing investment banks and stock markets from collapse , the global food crisis has worsened , a casualty of the growing financial tumult . 
Oxfam , the Britain - based aid group , estimates that economic chaos this year has pulled the incomes of an additional 119 million people below the poverty line . 
Richer countries from the United States to the Persian Gulf are busy helping themselves and have been slow to lend a hand . 
The contrast between the rapid-fire reaction by Western authorities to the financial crisis and their comparatively modest response to soaring food prices earlier this year has triggered anger among aid and farming groups . 
`` The amount of money used for the bailouts in the U.S. and Europe -- people here are saying that money is enough to feed the poor in Africa for the next three years , '' said Muchiri , head of the Eastern Africa Farmers Federation . 
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 923 million people were seriously undernourished in 2007 . 
Its director-general , Jacques Diouf , said in a recent speech that he worries about cuts in aid to agriculture in developing countries . 
He said he is also concerned by protectionist trade measures intended to counteract the financial turmoil . 
Although the price of commodities has come down in the past few months , Diouf said , 36 countries still need emergency assistance for food , and he warned of a looming disaster next year if countries do not make food security a top priority . 
`` The global financial crisis should not make us forget the food crisis , '' Diouf said . 
Commodity prices have plummeted in recent weeks as investors have shown increasing concern about a global recession and a drop in the demand for goods . 
Wheat futures for December delivery closed at $ 5.1625 on Friday -- down 62 percent from a record set in February . 
Corn futures are down 53 percent from their all-time high , and soybean futures are 47 percent lower . 
Such declines , while initially welcomed by consumers , could eventually increase deflationary pressures -- lower prices could mean less incentive for farmers to cultivate crops . 
That , in turn , could exacerbate the global food shortage .

"A World in Crisis Means A Chance for Greatness Aspiring U.S. politicians dream of being FDR , but rarely do the times and the person converge . 
The next president will have the chance to be a 21st-century FDR . 
For either Barack Obama or John McCain , the first duty will be to restore confidence . 
Hundreds of billions of dollars have been allotted to fix the financial breakdown . 
But fears have gripped the country . 
The new president needs not only a bold program but also the resolution to reassure . 
The parallels with FDR offer a striking starting point . 
The new administration will need to recapitalize banks . 
It will also need to offer millions of American families a lifeline by helping homeowners manage their mortgage debts while staying in their homes . 
This modernized New Deal would simultaneously extend a hand to the broad middle class while countering the continuing slide in house prices that continue to drive down communities , lenders ' portfolios and trust . 
The new president will need to overhaul a failed financial regulatory and supervisory system in a way that preserves innovation . 
He will need to establish clearing and settlement mechanisms to ensure that failing firms do not freeze credit markets , to set strong liquidity as well as capital standards for the financial sector , and to thwart irresponsible behavior . 
And beyond all that , the new team will need a fiscal-stimulus package that the New Deal left out . 
Political leadership is not just about programs and bills . 
The new president will need to use his first hundred days to build his standing . 
He must point the way to use the United States ' ingenuity and restored sense of purpose to build for the future : quality schools , basic health-care choices and worker assistance to help citizens adjust to change in a competitive world ; immigration rules that let the United States attract talent and regenerate its spirit ; and more low-carbon technology to enable growth while protecting both the environment and national security . 
Then , after opening the coffers of the U.S. Treasury , the president will need to guide both Congress and the public to rebuild savings and responsibility . 
The next president faces another historic challenge : reintroducing the United States to the world . 
He could make a good start by promptly sending the vice president and the new secretaries of state , Treasury and defense to consult with countries large and small , developed and developing , on all continents . 
In early 1989 , Secretary of State James A. Baker III visited 15 NATO allies in eight days . 
With four emissaries , the new president could reach 50 countries or more in his first months in office . 
Those envoys should have a simple message : to listen and learn . 
Of course , the new team should have some initial ideas and priorities to discuss , but taking the time to hear other world leaders ' insights and concerns will prove as shrewd an investment as recapitalizing the banks . 
In 1944 , FDR and the other architects of the postwar Bretton Woods system built for the future even as they fought the armies of the past . 
The Bretton Woods generation left two legacies : first , international institutions -LRB- such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund -RRB- and , second , an intellectual and political commitment to act multilaterally to turn the problems of an era into opportunities . 
The new president can build on that legacy by modernizing multilateralism and markets . 
A new Bretton Woods should start by recognizing that the old G-7 club of the world 's most industrialized nations needs to give way to a new steering group that includes rising economic stakeholders . 
Rather than return to mid-20th-century models , the new multilateralism needs to be flexible , not fixed . 
It must be pragmatic , too -- maximizing the strength of interconnected global actors , including not just existing institutions such as the World Bank , the IMF and the United Nations but also private-sector firms and NGOs . 
In a networked world , we need networked multilateralism . 
That should be a litmus test for a Bretton Woods 2.0 . 
The new multilateralism will need to connect , for example , growth , development , trade , energy and climate change . 
The world expects to negotiate a new climate-change treaty by the end of next year , and that depends on recognizing development interests while shifting to lower carbon growth . 
To help the `` bottom billion '' in post-conflict and fragile states , the United Nations and the World Bank need to secure development with roots deep enough to break the cycle of fragility and violence . 
A new president should build on his predecessor 's financial innovations for development , including for HIV\/AIDS treatment , the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the new Climate Investment Funds . 
The aftershocks of the developed countries ' financial crisis and recession will also require the United States to work with other countries , the World Bank and the IMF to help the most vulnerable . 
We need a human rescue , not just a financial rescue . 
With the global economy under stress , the world will be watching the president 's commitment to cutting trade barriers and wasteful agricultural subsidies in the Doha World Trade Organization negotiation . 
The rise of such developing economies as China and India provides the world with multiple poles of growth that can help a global recovery . 
But the emergence of these big new economic players also serves as fodder for scaremongers , intent on whipping up fear about the effects on living standards in the developed world . 
"
"Further legislation to deal with the economic crisis should not wait until the new president takes office . 
Fortunately , the president-elect will be a senator and can propose legislation without waiting to be sworn in as president . 
Immediately after Nov. 4 , the winner could , and should , take the lead in the legislative process . 
The economy faces two separate problems : the downward spiral of home prices , which hangs over the financial markets , and the decline in aggregate spending , which could cause a deep and prolonged recession . 
Home prices have already fallen about 25 percent from their peak in 2006 , and experts say they must fall an additional 10 to 15 percent to get back to pre-bubble levels . 
But they could fall much further than that as a result of mortgage defaults and foreclosures . 
Further declines from the current level would increase the number of homeowners whose mortgages exceed the value of their homes , creating a strong incentive to default . 
Defaults and the resulting foreclosures would put more homes on the market , driving down prices even more . 
And this fear of a deep drop in home prices depresses the value of mortgage-backed securities , contributing to the difficulty that banks are having raising funds and to their reluctance to make loans . 
Although home prices must get back to pre-bubble levels , Congress should enact policies to reduce defaults that could drive prices down much further . 
Direct help to the 12 million homeowners who already have negative equity in their homes could help to stop foreclosures . 
But it is important for Congress to go further and stop declining prices from pushing a large portion of the other 37 million homeowners with mortgages into negative equity , which could tempt them to default . 
The mortgage replacement loan plan that I suggested in June , essentially a congressionally enacted mortgage `` firewall '' to prevent prices from dropping too far , is one possible way to do that . 
Falling home prices have already reduced homeowner wealth by about $ 3 trillion ; the stock market decline has cut wealth by an additional $ 8 trillion . 
This reduced household wealth is causing consumers to cut spending , leading to lower employment , lower incomes and , therefore , further cuts in consumer spending . 
Other components of aggregate demand are also falling . 
The decline in consumer spending will lead to less business investment in plants and equipment . 
And the recession in Europe and Japan will further reduce our net exports . 
With the Fed 's benchmark interest rate down to 1 percent , there is no scope for an easier monetary policy to stop the downward spiral in aggregate demand . 
Another round of one-time tax rebates wo n't do the job . 
The rebates that Congress enacted this spring failed to stimulate consumer spending : More than 80 percent of tax rebate dollars were saved or used to pay down existing debt . 
The only way to prevent a deepening recession will be a temporary program of increased government spending . 
Previous attempts to use government spending to stimulate an economic recovery , particularly spending on infrastructure , have not been successful because of long legislative lags that delayed the spending until a recovery was well underway . 
But while past recessions lasted an average of only about 12 months , this downturn is likely to last much longer , providing the scope for successful countercyclical spending . 
A fiscal package of $ 100 billion is not likely to be large enough to revive the economy . 
The fall in household wealth resulting from the collapse of the stock market and the decline of home prices may cut aggregate spending by $ 300 billion a year or more . 
The president-elect should focus on developing a mechanism for identifying and funding spending initiatives that can occur quickly and that would otherwise not be done . 
While it would be good if some of the increased spending also contributed to long-term productivity , the key is to stimulate demand . 
Any plan to finance this spending by raising taxes , even if postponed , as Sen. Barack Obama has suggested , would hurt the recovery by causing affected taxpayers to cut their spending now . 
The increased government spending should include not only money for infrastructure such as bridges and roads but also for a wide range of equipment . 
Rebuilding some of the military capacity that has been depleted by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could be done relatively quickly and should be part of the overall package . 
Although the economy is facing severe challenges , the president-elect can turn the situation around by introducing legislation to deal with the downward spiral in home prices and with the declining level of aggregate demand . 
It is important that such legislation be enacted as quickly as possible .

"As China 's Losses Mount , Confidence Turns to Fear A worker waiting to get a defaulted salary sleeps on a desk at a Smart Union toy factory in Dongguan . 
When the owners slipped three months behind on salaries , 7,000 workers staged a strike . 
-LRB- China Photos Via Getty Images -RRB- A worker and her child pick up toys at Smart Union . 
Local officials handed out about $ 3.5 million to workers after they occupied the factory . 
-LRB- China Photos Via Getty Images -RRB- SHENZHEN , China -- When Chong Yik Toy Co. went bankrupt , the bosses fled without meeting their payroll and angry workers took to the streets in protest . 
Less than 72 hours later , the local government came to the rescue . 
Armed with bags full of cash totaling half a million dollars , accountants began distributing the money so the 900 former employees would have something to get by on . 
The Chinese officials who made the emergency payments on Oct. 21 called it an `` advance , '' part of a `` back-pay insurance fund . '' 
But the reality was obvious to everyone : It was a government bailout . 
In the initial weeks of the global financial crisis , Chinese officials resolutely declared that they were not significantly affected . 
But now , as factory closings , dire corporate earnings reports and stock market losses continue to mount , the Communist Party 's confidence has changed to another feeling entirely : fear . 
For the first time in the 30 years since China began its capitalist transformation , there is a perception that the economy is in real trouble . 
And for the Communist Party , the crisis is not just an economic one , but a political one . 
The government 's response offers a glimpse into its still ambiguous relationship with capitalism -- relatively hands-off in good times , but quick to intervene directly at the first signs of a downturn in order to prevent popular unrest . 
In recent weeks , local governments have set up special loans for ailing companies and initiated severance payments for workers who have already lost their jobs . 
Officials are candid in acknowledging the efforts are needed to head off what they call `` mass incidents '' -- the Communist Party euphemism for protests . 
The economic devastation has been worst in the industrial centers of southern China , areas that had thrived in recent decades by producing the electronics , clothing , toys and furniture that fill retail stores in the United States . 
With export orders falling because of the global slowdown and rising raw material and labor costs , more than 68,000 small companies nationwide collapsed in the first half of 2008 and about 2.5 million jobs in the Pearl River Delta region may be lost by the end of the year , according to government and industry estimates . 
As the economy has soured , dissatisfaction has grown : Since mid-October , there have been dozens of labor protests involving thousands of workers at major exporters , including several publicly listed companies . 
Meanwhile , government figures released last month show that the gross domestic product grew by 9 percent in the third quarter -- robust by almost any standard , but not in China . 
Here , the figure represented the slowest growth in five years , and was dangerously close to 8 percent . 
That 's the level at which economists say China needs to grow in order to keep generating enough factory jobs to maintain stability in the labor market , as millions of peasants continue to pour into Chinese cities in search of work . 
At the same time , some of China 's most revered companies , whose growth once seemed limitless , have reported surprising losses in the past few days . 
Air China , the nation 's biggest international carrier , posted its first loss in seven quarters because of declining passenger numbers and wrong-way bets on fuel prices . 
Bank of China , the nation 's largest foreign-exchange lender , said that as credit-market losses went up , its profit growth went down to its slowest in two years . 
China 's leaders have made a variety of moves to try to stabilize the economy -- three interest rate cuts in six weeks , new export tax rebates , reduced costs for home buyers , and billions spent on infrastructure . 
But any hope that a strong Chinese economy -- the single largest contributor to global growth -- would offset the slowdown elsewhere is gone .

"Sen. Barack Obama , so steady in public , did not hide his vexation when he summoned his top advisers to meet with him in Chicago on Sept. 14 . 
His general-election campaign had gone stale . 
For weeks , he had watched Sen. John McCain suction up the oxygen in the race , driving the news coverage after the boisterous Republican convention in St. Paul , Minn. , and suddenly drawing huge crowds with his new running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin . 
Convening the meeting that Sunday in the office of David Axelrod , his chief strategist , Obama was blunt : It was time to get serious . 
`` He said , ` You know , maybe we can just win it on the issues . 
But I do n't think so , ' '' recalled senior adviser Anita Dunn . 
With the debates approaching and just seven weeks until the election , `` his charge to everybody was ` Guys , we 're back in combat mode , ' '' Dunn said . 
And then , the next morning , a global earthquake hit : Lehman Brothers , the giant investment firm , filed for bankruptcy , triggering the biggest corporate collapse in U.S. history and an international financial meltdown , and transforming the presidential race . 
It was a moment neither the senator from Illinois nor his advisers had anticipated , but one for which they were uniquely prepared . 
In the days that followed , the newly chastised Obama team became more aggressive , with a message they had refined over the summer . 
The candidate himself , criticized as too cool , too cerebral and too detached , suddenly had the opportunity to show those qualities to be reassuring and presidential . 
For McCain , already struggling with the economic issue , the Wall Street meltdown became part of a much different narrative . 
By the time the senator from Arizona made the surprise announcement on Sept. 24 that he would suspend his campaign , a powerful image had been framed : of an `` erratic , '' older Republican who could not be trusted to handle a crisis , economic or otherwise . 
In a race that had been thought to be even , the polls showed Obama to be pulling ahead , a lead that he would not relinquish through three debates and the election 's closing weeks . 
`` It was a pivotal two weeks of the election , '' Axelrod said yesterday . '' 
... It changed the structure of the race , in that it just never went back . 
Once people had rendered that verdict , it just did n't change . '' 
In the end , both the candidate and the campaign lived up to the challenge Obama outlined that Sunday in Chicago . 
They benefited from a dose of what his staff called `` Obama luck . '' 
But to paraphrase the famous adage of Pasteur , it was the kind of luck that favored only a prepared candidate . 
If Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton -LRB- N.Y. -RRB- had been a formidable primary opponent , McCain seemed to present another challenge to Obama -- as one of the few Republicans who could potentially slip the damaging shackles of his party and run on his compelling biography as a former prisoner of war and as someone with a record of working with Democrats . 
`` John McCain had the potential to be the toughest Republican opponent we could have drawn , '' said Dan Pfeiffer , Obama 's communications director . 
`` Although his record told a different story , his national celebrity was based on his opposition to President Bush and his reform credentials . 
On paper , McCain was perfectly suited to run a very strong campaign that nullified some of our strengths and exploited some of our weaknesses . ''

"'' Follow The World Desk On : Financial Crisis Leaves Romania Reeling A bank and foreign currency exchange in Bucharest , where many consumers are struggling to repay loans they took out in euros and Swiss francs . 
-LRB- By Craig Whitlock -- The Washington Post -RRB- BUCHAREST , Romania -- In recent days , this once-booming country has been pounded by aftershocks from the global financial crisis . 
Speculators have attacked the local currency , the leu , betting that it would plunge in value . 
At one point last month , the stock market had dropped by 70 percent . 
By next year , some analysts predict , the jobless rate could double . 
Like many of its East European neighbors , Romania is experiencing a sudden reversal of fortune . 
After years of record economic growth fueled by easy credit and heavy foreign investment , people here are bracing for a sharp slowdown that they hope does not turn into an outright crash . 
Two of Romania 's neighbors , Hungary and Ukraine , already have been forced to accept bailouts from the International Monetary Fund . 
Next-door Bulgaria , with a bulging current-account deficit , has troubles of its own . 
To the north , the Baltic states are also feeling a severe pinch , with consumers deeply in hock to stressed Scandinavian banks . 
The European Union , which many of the former Soviet satellite countries thought would bring them stability , has n't offered much help . 
`` I 'm afraid E.U. membership is not enough protection for Romania , Bulgaria and the Baltics , '' said Ilie Serbanescu , an economist and former government official . 
`` The entire Romanian economy is in the hands of foreign companies . 
If the international situation is good , then it 's no problem . 
But if the situation is not good , like now , we are in trouble . '' 
Romanian officials have acknowledged some of their economic difficulties but said concerns about the country 's stability are overblown . 
In an Oct. 22 speech , President Traian Basescu pinned the blame on `` corrupt '' outsiders . 
`` There were smart guys coming to Romania , who had studied at Harvard and Oxford , and they invented how to increase the value of one 's shares without actually having money , '' he said . 
Officials here have brushed aside talk of an IMF bailout , which would be a setback for a country that joined the E.U. just last year . 
They especially reject comparisons to Iceland , which has been hit so hard that bankrupt entrepreneurs are now looking for jobs as cod fishermen . 
`` I am sick and tired of comparing Romania to the Baltic states and Iceland . 
What do we have in common ? '' 
Mugur Isarescu , the governor of Romania 's central bank , said in an interview . 
`` This is the black part of globalization , the fact that you have all these ratings agencies and others putting together six or seven countries in the same boat . '' 
At the same time , Isarescu and other officials said Romania has serious challenges to overcome . 
The central bank has raised interest rates seven times in the past year . 
Last month , it was forced to intervene in the currency markets to prop up the leu , which traders were betting would collapse against the euro . 
`` It was creating here a kind of panic , '' Isarescu said . 
Romania plans to adopt the euro in 2014 but needs to meet a number of economic benchmarks before it can do so . 
Romania 's biggest problem is its current-account deficit : Far more money has been pouring into the country than going out . 
Much of the money comes from the estimated 2.5 million Romanians -- more than 10 percent of the population -- who work in countries such as Italy and Spain and send earnings back . 
But with those economies now suffering as well , many emigrants are expected to return home empty-handed .

"Barack Obama owes his victory in large measure to the prospect of the longest and deepest economic downturn in a quarter-century and perhaps since the Great Depression . 
If he performs well , he could become a great president . 
If he flubs it , he could get the same reception as Jimmy Carter . 
In the crassest political terms , it was good luck to have the financial crisis hit so close to the election . 
But Obama 's lucky streak will end in a hurry if he ca n't find a way out of this mess . 
He will also have to manage expectations : Even if he does everything perfectly , we probably wo n't turn the corner for 18 months , and the downturn could last far longer than that . 
The first task facing President-elect Obama , after eight years of misguided economic policies , will be to begin the recovery -- or at least forestall a further decline . 
It wo n't be easy . 
Some 1.2 million jobs have already been shed this year , and some three-quarters of a million Americans are about to exhaust their limited unemployment-insurance benefits . 
By October , only 32 percent of unemployed Americans were receiving unemployment checks . 
To make matters worse , when Americans lose their jobs , they typically lose their health insurance , too . 
Meanwhile , 3.8 million homes are under foreclosure , and states are facing massive revenue shortfalls ; without assistance , they will have to cut spending , plunging the economy deeper into recession . 
So some steps are obvious : assistance to homeowners and bankruptcy reform ; extending unemployment insurance ; and making up for the gap in state revenue . 
The United States also has an infrastructure deficit , not just a fiscal and trade deficit , which means that spending more on infrastructure -LRB- such as public transport and technology -- especially of the green variety -RRB- will stimulate the economy in the short term and help us be more competitive in the long run . 
But then matters start to get trickier . 
The economy obviously needs a direct shot in the arm , but the 44th president needs to be careful about the design of the stimulus he proposes . 
That 's because President Bush will bequeath him a national debt -- $ 10.5 trillion and rising -- that has almost doubled since he took office , even before you factor in the full costs of the financial bailout and the Medicare prescription benefit , as well as the price tag for providing for the hundreds of thousands of returning Iraq war veterans . 
To his credit , Obama knows much of this . 
During the campaign , he argued against cutting taxes on upper-income Americans , who have done so well in recent years . 
In addition to repealing the 2001-03 tax cuts for the wealthiest , Obama should also consider taxing dividends and capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income : It would reduce the deficit , have few short-term adverse effects on an already reeling economy and make the tax code more fair . 
After all , why should speculators -- whether on oil , food or real estate -- be taxed less than those who work long hours to make a living ? 
Another major problem Obama has to tackle is growing inequality in this country . 
Some of these trends will take decades to reverse , but ensuring that no Americans are denied a college education because they ca n't afford it , providing adequate funding for public primary and secondary schools and so forth would be a good beginning Obama has also promised to wind down the war in Iraq . 
Spending a fraction of the war 's cost -- my estimate places the total at $ 3 trillion for our entire economy -- on investments within the United States would help reduce the deficit and boost economic growth at home . 
While the federal deficit looms over the Obama administration 's economic deliberations , we must be careful not to let it block bold action . 
Sometimes , we 're wiser to pay now rather than later . 
Borrowing for high-yielding investments -LRB- not just Wall Street bailouts -RRB- is common sense . 
The decisions not to reinforce the levees in New Orleans or upgrade the bridges in Minneapolis were penny-wise , pound-foolish blunders that we lived to regret . 
The root of so many of our problems is the reeling financial sector . 
The plan cooked up by Bush and his Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , is n't likely to work , or work well enough . 
So Obama 's team will have to wade in . 
Already , the banks have been talking about using taxpayers ' money for dividends , bonuses and acquiring other banks , rather than doing more lending , which was clearly what Congress had in mind for the $ 700 billion . 
U.S. taxpayers got a raw deal , compared to the terms won by other governments -LRB- such as Great Britain -RRB- or by the legendary investor Warren Buffett , who provided capital to the best capitalized investment bank , Paulson 's own Goldman Sachs . 
Want further proof that Washington got a lousy deal ? 
Look at how the markets reacted . 
The share prices of the bailed-out banks shot up , showing that investors expected net profits to rise substantially . 
The U.S. financial sector , once the emblem of our economic success , has failed us . 
Financial markets are supposed to allocate capital and manage risk ; instead , they squandered capital and created risk . 
Even more galling , the banks ' chiefs raked in private rewards totally out of whack with what scant good they were doing for the wider society .

"SAO PAULO , Brazil , Nov. 8 -- Brazilian President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva told international finance ministers Saturday that developing countries must be given a greater role in finding solutions to the world 's financial crisis . 
`` This is a global crisis and demands global solutions , '' Lula said in opening remarks at a meeting of the Group of 20 , an organization of major industrialized and developing nations . 
`` The crisis started in advanced economies . 
It is a result of the blind belief in the market 's self-regulation capacity and , by and large , of the lack of control of the activities of financial agents . '' 
During the two-day gathering in Sao Paulo , officials are expected to discuss how the economic downturn has affected their countries and how governments can coordinate responses and stimulus efforts . 
Lula called on the group to come up with proposals for `` substantial change of the world 's financial architecture , '' saying the global credit crunch is hurting the world 's poor . 
Brazil and many other developing countries want to be included in meetings of the largest industrial nations , where the recent crisis originated . 
The G-20 began in 1999 during the Asian financial crisis , but the group 's meetings , notwithstanding the emergency session in Washington scheduled for this week , have not included presidents and prime ministers . 
Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said Saturday that his country refused to be `` mere coffee drinkers '' on the sidelines of the richer nations ' meetings . 
Many developing countries want to restructure organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to give the nations more of a voice in decision making , said Jenilee Guebert , a senior researcher with the G20 Research Group at the University of Toronto . 
`` Right now , the emerging economies essentially have no voice within the IMF-World Bank system , '' she said . 
`` They want to be included . 
They want a bigger role in the international system ... We live in a globalized world , and they just feel that seven countries or eight countries should n't be representing the whole world . '' 
Canadian Finance Minister James M. Flaherty said the countries are also discussing further interest rate cuts , Bloomberg reported . 
`` The U.K. made a fairly dramatic rate drop this week , and there 's more discussion here about that subject , '' Flaherty said . 
Emerging economies have suffered during the crisis as investment funds fled for safer places , stock markets tumbled and local currencies lost value against the U.S. dollar . 
With the tightening of international credit markets , companies in emerging markets have had difficulty getting loans . 
In Latin America , falling commodity prices have hit particularly hard because of a dependence on exporting oil , minerals and agricultural products . 
`` Many developing countries are moving into a new danger zone , '' the World Bank said in a recent paper . 
`` With this latest financial crisis , growth is slowing and is likely to weaken even more sharply . 
Developing-country exports to developed countries are falling , capital is being withdrawn from emerging markets , and short-term credit is drying up . '' 
Lula said his main concern was the impact of the crisis on trade , fearing that rich countries will reduce imports . 
`` Brazil believes countries must avoid the temptation of resorting to financial and trade protectionism as a mechanism to overcome the crisis , '' he said . 
The International Monetary Fund said last week that growth in the advanced economies would contract next year for the first time since World War II . 
The United States is represented at the G-20 summit by David H. McCormick , undersecretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department , and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke . 
McCormick said in a statement that Lula `` presented a constructive overview of the challenges we face and the need for developed and developing nations to work together in addressing those challenges . ''

"A Quiet Windfall For U.S. Banks The financial world was fixated on Capitol Hill as Congress battled over the Bush administration 's request for a $ 700 billion bailout of the banking industry . 
In the midst of this late-September drama , the Treasury Department issued a five-sentence notice that attracted almost no public attention . 
But corporate tax lawyers quickly realized the enormous implications of the document : Administration officials had just given American banks a windfall of as much as $ 140 billion . 
The sweeping change to two decades of tax policy escaped the notice of lawmakers for several days , as they remained consumed with the controversial bailout bill . 
When they found out , some legislators were furious . 
Some congressional staff members have privately concluded that the notice was illegal . 
But they have worried that saying so publicly could unravel several recent bank mergers made possible by the change and send the economy into an even deeper tailspin . 
`` Did the Treasury Department have the authority to do this ? 
I think almost every tax expert would agree that the answer is no , '' said George K. Yin , the former chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation , the nonpartisan congressional authority on taxes . 
`` They basically repealed a 22-year-old law that Congress passed as a backdoor way of providing aid to banks . '' 
The story of the obscure provision underscores what critics in Congress , academia and the legal profession warn are the dangers of the broad authority being exercised by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. in addressing the financial crisis . 
Lawmakers are now looking at whether the new notice was introduced to benefit specific banks , as well as whether it inappropriately accelerated bank takeovers . 
The change to Section 382 of the tax code -- a provision that limited a kind of tax shelter arising in corporate mergers -- came after a two-decade effort by conservative economists and Republican administration officials to eliminate or overhaul the law , which is so little-known that even influential tax experts sometimes draw a blank at its mention . 
Until the financial meltdown , its opponents thought it would be nearly impossible to revamp the section because this would look like a corporate giveaway , according to lobbyists . 
Andrew C. DeSouza , a Treasury spokesman , said the administration had the legal authority to issue the notice as part of its power to interpret the tax code and provide legal guidance to companies . 
He described the Sept. 30 notice , which allows some banks to keep more money by lowering their taxes , as a way to help financial institutions during a time of economic crisis . 
`` This is part of our overall effort to provide relief , '' he said . 
The Treasury itself did not estimate how much the tax change would cost , DeSouza said . 
The guidance issued from the IRS caught even some of the closest followers of tax law off guard because it seemed to come out of the blue when Treasury 's work seemed focused almost exclusively on the bailout . 
`` It was a shock to most of the tax law community . 
It was one of those things where it pops up on your screen and your jaw drops , '' said Candace A. Ridgway , a partner at Jones Day , a law firm that represents banks that could benefit from the notice . 
`` I 've been in tax law for 20 years , and I 've never seen anything like this . '' 
More than a dozen tax lawyers interviewed for this story -- including several representing banks that stand to reap billions from the change -- said the Treasury had no authority to issue the notice . 
Several other tax lawyers , all of whom represent banks , said the change was legal . 
Like DeSouza , they said the legal authority came from Section 382 itself , which says the secretary can write regulations to `` carry out the purposes of this section . ''

"World economic leaders will gather in Washington Saturday for a summit to address the global financial crisis . 
It is no coincidence that Brazil , China , India and other emerging-market nations have not only been invited to the summit but are expected to play meaningful roles . 
The credit crunch , which began in the United States , has quickly spread to the developing world . 
The summit agenda will be dominated by monetary policy coordination and new roles for international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund . 
In his Nov. 3 op-ed , `` Fairness for Emerging Markets , '' Kemal Dervis made the case for `` making massive credit lines available '' to most emerging-market economies . 
But if we are to limit the depth of the looming global recession , trade finance must also be on the agenda . 
Cross-border lending by banks based in developed countries fell at a record pace in the second quarter and continued its decline at an accelerated rate in the third quarter . 
One casualty is the drying up of trade finance , the lifeblood of $ 14 trillion annually in global commerce . 
Wachovia 's recent troubles , for example , have already led to a sharp reduction in short-term trade finance lines to Latin America . 
Other banks are reassessing credit lines for trading with Asia , Africa and Eastern Europe . 
The credit crisis has moved into trade finance as largely a funding problem . 
If bank lines are shut off , it would be devastating for the economies of the developing world . 
It would also have a boomerang effect on the United States and Europe , as key export markets -- and the jobs that go with them -- disappeared . 
Fortunately , there are institutions already built to promote trade finance : export credit agencies . 
The Export-Import Bank of the United States was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934 , in the midst of the Great Depression . 
It is a `` lender of last resort '' that provides credit lines when private financial markets are not lending . 
Last year , the bank authorized more than $ 12 billion in guarantees and insurance to support U.S. exporters . 
Export credit agencies have helped mitigate a financial crisis before . 
In late 1997 , banks were unwilling to provide credit to Asia after currency and equity markets there plunged . 
The U.S. Export-Import Bank confirmed letters of credit issued by 15 South Korean banks to support the purchase of raw materials and spare parts needed by Korean manufacturers . 
In February 1998 , 20 official export credit agencies met in London to encourage each other to remain open and to offer new support to exports to Asia . 
The U.S. Export-Import Bank played its part by initiating a new program for South Korea that month . 
Within nine months , it supported 2,460 transactions worth more than $ 1 billion for U.S. exporters to sell to Korean firms -LRB- up from only $ 40 million the year before -RRB- . 
Similar trade credit programs were launched for Indonesia and Thailand . 
These special short-term lending and trade credit insurance lines played a catalytic role in helping to build confidence in Asia at a critical time -- and helped the region rebound quickly . 
None of the Korean banks defaulted , and the entire Export-Import Bank Korean program cost American taxpayers not one dime . 
In the coming days , the U.S. Export-Import Bank and other export credit agencies should take the lead in getting trade finance flowing again . 
First , the export credit agencies should convene to share information and confirm credit availability for the pivotal months ahead . 
The World Trade Organization has called a special meeting of trade finance players for Wednesday , and the subject will be a major topic of discussion at next Monday 's meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . 
But Saturday 's summit is the venue to push for decisive action . 
Second , even though the Federal Reserve Bank 's discount window is now available to non-bank institutions , the volume of credit needed suggests it is crucial to find a way for the Export-Import Bank to fund asset-based lenders who support thousands of small suppliers in connection to exports . 
The bank should institute a new and unprecedented , but temporary , program that provides short-term funding to intermediary lenders . 
Third , with credit markets largely closed , traditional financing sources for medium - and long-term commercial export finance are not available . 
The Export-Import Bank must revitalize its direct-lending programs , but in ways that continue to engage the institutional skills and delivery capabilities of commercial lenders . 
It is critical for global prosperity that trade financing -- be it keeping credit lines open , oiling the trade supply chain or direct funding -- remain vibrant during the financial crisis . 
A concerted effort by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and other export credit agencies can make a meaningful difference in how the real economy responds and recovers .

"When the finance ministers of the world 's top economies convened in Washington last month , around the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund , they developed a remarkably successful international strategy for responding to the financial crisis , which had reached panic proportions in the markets . 
It was promptly implemented at the national level by all the key countries and quelled the worst of the anxieties . 
When the leaders of the top 20 of these countries meet on Saturday , they must build on that outcome by adopting a similarly global approach to counter the sharp downturn in the world economy that could otherwise become the most severe since the Depression . 
To do so , the Group of 20 must at a minimum do no harm . 
Any surfacing of significant conflicts over such contentious issues as internationalization of financial regulation would undermine confidence , which remains extremely fragile , dissipating the hard-won gains to date and throwing markets into a new tailspin . 
Leaders must , for example , avoid the temptation to agonize over who caused the crisis and recognize that , while the United States was clearly at its center , there is plenty of blame to go around . 
The most positive step the leaders could take would be to pledge to adopt fiscal stimulus programs amounting to at least 1 to 2 percent of most of their national economies . 
Such an injection of domestic demand throughout the G-20 would provide a critical spur to world economic expansion and substantially reduce the depth of the recession . 
China , which now accounts for more than one-third of all global growth , has demonstrated admirable leadership by announcing an expansion program of much greater magnitude . 
It is up to the United States and Europe , in particular , to follow suit ; an international commitment should help overcome internal opposition to such steps -LRB- especially in the United States and Germany -RRB- . 
The G-20 should also disavow the imposition of any new trade distortions . 
It was a wave of protectionist trade measures , triggered by the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff in the United States and quickly emulated by most Europeans , that converted the depression of the early 1930s into the Great Depression . 
China has recently adopted new export subsidies , a particularly unhelpful step by a country running the world 's largest trade surplus and , despite its recent slowdown , the world 's fastest growth rate . 
Any new outbreak of border restrictions or their domestic equivalents would threaten growth everywhere and further jeopardize market stability . 
The leaders also need to pledge at least $ 500 billion to augment the resources of the International Monetary Fund so it can meet the potential needs of developing countries hammered by the crisis . 
The IMF is already lending to Hungary , Iceland , Pakistan and Ukraine , but a longer queue is forming rapidly . 
Japan has offered $ 200 billion , and China , with reserves nearing $ 2 trillion , could provide at least as much . 
The rich oil exporters , represented by Saudi Arabia at the G-20 , could do so as well . 
The lenders would , of course , receive an IMF guarantee on their money and should welcome this alternative to U.S. Treasury securities . 
The final component of the G-20 package should be the creation of working groups to address systemic issues that helped bring on the crisis , most of which require careful analysis and preparation before thoughtful action is feasible . 
The most obvious is financial regulation , which clearly broke down in the United States and numerous other countries ; there is an important international dimension because of the cross-border nature of many financial institutions and market instruments . 
Another is the failure of the IMF , and its major member countries , to anticipate the crisis and to initiate preventive actions . 
A closely related third issue is the growing lack of political legitimacy of the IMF thanks to its gross under-representation of rapidly emerging Asian powers and the parallel over-representation , for historical reasons , of Europeans . 
Thoughtful analysis by the new working groups could tee up these issues for decisive action at future summits and help considerably in avoiding repetitions of today 's predicament . 
It is difficult for the United States to lead the preparation of such a package , given the lame-duck status of President Bush , who is hosting the summit . 
It is critical , then , that President-elect Barack Obama concur with the outcomes of the gathering , both to ensure their faithful pursuit in the future and to avoid internal U.S. rancor that could be as destabilizing for markets as conflict among the countries . 
Effective consultation between the outgoing and incoming administrations is central to the success of the gathering . 
So is active leadership from the Europeans , who called for the meeting , and the Asians , who have the most dynamic economies and most of the money . 
History may regard this weekend as the beginning of a transition in global economic power as well as a milestone in resolving the crisis of 2008 . 
C. Fred Bergsten , director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , was assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs from 1977 to 1981 and assistant for international economic affairs to the National Security Council from 1969 to 1971 .

Thursday , November 13 , 2008 ; Page A23 The Bush administration initially was n't enthusiastic about this weekend 's meeting of the Group of 20 nations to discuss the global financial crisis . 
But the summit is going to happen anyway , and maybe that 's the real point . 
Having fouled the global economic nest , America must now work with other nations to clean it up . 
The meeting is intended to send reassuring signals to global financial markets that a coordinated global rescue and recovery are on the way . 
And good luck with that ! 
The danger is that the hastily organized summit , hosted by a lame-duck U.S. president , will also convey a subliminal message of discord over the future of the global economy . 
The summit will mark several important , but potentially bumpy , transitions : the arrival of China as a co-manager of global prosperity ; the new assertiveness of Europe in arguing for its own , Brussels-style transnational approach to financial regulation ; and the growing anger of developing economies such as Brazil , which feel caught in a downturn for which they had no responsibility . 
This gathering of 20 nations is a reminder , above all , that the smaller club of rich nations known as the Group of Eight has failed to stop the financial disaster . 
`` This crisis has made all participants in the system more equal , '' says Antonio Patriota , Brazil 's ambassador to the United States . 
Anger toward America for creating the financial contagion is a powerful , if largely unstated , theme . 
During a conference call Monday among G-20 members to prepare for the summit , there were complaints about `` the speculation and deregulation in the U.S. that became this market tsunami , '' according to one participant . 
What 's frustrating is that even as the summiteers debate big , woolly issues of financial architecture , the global economy remains crippled by nettlesome technical problems . 
Financial institutions are continuing to sell assets in a falling market to meet capital requirements or other rules . 
These `` pro-cyclical '' practices are reinforcing the downward spiral , and the G-20 's penchant for rule-making and regulation may make the pro-cyclical problem worse . 
`` Maybe we have turned a corner , but it 's a corner in an octagon , '' the worried chief executive of one leading global hedge fund told me this week . 
The godfather of the summit is French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who is in his last months in the rotating presidency of the European Union . 
He paid a quickie visit to Camp David to lobby President Bush personally for the summit and prodded other European nations to support a far-reaching package of new regulations . 
Administration officials chafed at Sarkozy 's campaign , but in the crisis atmosphere they decided not to fight it . 
The French have been lobbying for a draft resolution endorsed last Friday by European leaders in Brussels that calls for global supervision of rating agencies , convergence of accounting standards , coordination of financial oversight across national boundaries , `` codes of conduct to avoid excessive risk-taking in the financial sector , '' and , finally , a leading role for the International Monetary Fund in overseeing the recovery and regulation package . 
The French want another summit in 100 days to ratify these measures , with the blessing of President Obama . 
Bush administration officials support some items in this package , but they are wary of the unintended consequences of new regulations -- particularly ones that are rushed through during a crisis . 
The big need right now , many analysts argue , is for fiscal stimulus on the model of China 's massive $ 586 billion package announced this week , rather than a new regulatory architecture . 
A simpler set of reforms would address the practical reasons why , months into the crisis , financial institutions are still being forced to sell at distressed prices . 
One example is the so-called Basel II capital standards for banks , published in 2004 by the Bank for International Settlements . 
Though intended to provide a cushion for hard times , these standards are now forcing banks to liquidate assets to raise capital . 
Instead , it 's argued , the BIS should adopt a countercyclical approach in which banks post more capital during good times and then draw it down when the economy declines . 
Similar countercyclical measures are needed for rules that affect insurance companies and other big players -- so that their forced selling does n't exacerbate the crisis . 
This weekend 's gathering has been billed as a new Bretton Woods . 
But as one commentator has noted , that epochal 1944 conclave took three years to prepare , whereas this one has taken about three weeks . 
Even for a world that 's angry with America , it makes sense to build the new financial framework more carefully .

"Saturday 's financial summit in Washington will be a good thing in itself : After years of `` G-7 '' and `` G-8 '' meetings , the new `` G-20 '' format will give most of the key emerging economies seats at the world 's top table . 
The summit could be even better if it spurs governments to pass stimulus packages : Already , China has announced a gargantuan infrastructure spending program that should soften a global recession . 
But the tricky challenge for the summit is to make global finance safer . 
To understand how headway could be made on that , it helps to think about finance as you might think about car insurance . 
Car insurance makes driving possible by pooling the cost of crashes . 
If I had to pay out of pocket any time I had an accident , I might never get behind the wheel ; I would want to have 80 grand in the bank in case I totaled someone 's Mercedes . 
But since the number of expensive cars that get smashed is actually quite small , I can deal with this risk cheaply by sharing it with other drivers . 
We all pay $ 5 weekly into the Mercedes fund , and suddenly there 's no need for vast sums in the bank . 
I 'm so much better off that I 'm visiting the Mercedes showroom . 
The most famous financial summit , the Bretton Woods gathering of 1944 , built upon this principle . 
Just as uninsured drivers need big savings to prepare for car crashes , uninsured nations need big savings to prepare for financial crashes . 
So the Bretton Woods architects created financial insurance in the form of the International Monetary Fund . 
Countries pooled savings that they would otherwise have kept in their central banks ; when a financial crisis struck , the IMF 's kitty was used to help afflicted members . 
The need for countries to hold savings in the form of central bank reserves was wonderfully reduced . 
Governments could allow their people to keep more of their money -- and take it to car showrooms . 
It is now time for a radical update of the Bretton Woods insurance scheme . 
The volume of capital flooding through the world 's system has increased exponentially , which makes crashes more costly . 
But the IMF 's kitty has not kept up . 
In 1990 , when the stock of cross-border portfolio investment stood at $ 171 billion , the IMF had $ 36 billion of lendable resources . 
Today , with cross-border portfolios at upward of $ 3 trillion , the IMF has a $ 201 billion war chest . 
The challenge has grown by a factor of 18 while the remedy has grown only sixfold . 
To restore the 1990 status quo , government commitments to the IMF should be tripled -- and if you take into account the vast growth of cross-border derivatives , an even larger expansion is needed . 
Because of the IMF 's relative decline , even the best-run nations face unacceptable risks . 
A decade ago , when a country such as Brazil experienced a financial crisis , it was possible to blame bad Brazilian policy . 
But in the past few years , Brazil has done just about everything right , and yet it has still been whiplashed . 
Capital that flooded into the country during the good years promptly flooded out again because of a freak event abroad : No-doc loans in the United States rear-ended Brazil 's economy . 
Over the past three months , the Brazilian stock market has fallen 37 percent , and the currency is down 30 percent against the dollar . 
If we had a bigger IMF , Brazil and similarly hit countries would borrow IMF dollars to replace the ones withdrawn by bankers who crashed their subprime go-karts . 
But the IMF lacks a sufficient emergency fund to deal with all the Brazils of the world . 
In the short term , this may mean that the credit crunch will hit emerging economies harder than it should -- and that the global recession will be worse than it needs to be . 
But the long-term consequences could be equally significant . 
In the absence of a larger IMF , Brazil and its equivalents have two options . 
They can plan to rely on powerful central banks for emergency loans -- during this crisis , the U.S. Federal Reserve has provided $ 30 billion apiece to Brazil , South Korea , Singapore and Mexico . 
The problem is that financing from a central bank may come with political conditions . 
That might sound fine if the central bank is the Fed . 
But what if it 's the People 's Bank of China , which has more than enough reserves to play the IMF surrogacy game ? 
A weak IMF could hand a powerful foreign policy tool to China . 
The other option for countries such as Brazil is to self-insure -- to be a driver with an $ 80,000 bank account . 
Again , this is already beginning to happen : After the IMF imposed unpopular conditions on crisis countries a decade ago , many emerging economies built up their reserves to avoid repeating that experience . 
But this every-country-for-itself reserve accumulation is not only wasteful . 
The savings that pile up in central bank vaults will largely take the form of dollar bonds -- that is , lending to Americans . 
If the past few years are any guide , the resulting whoosh of capital into the United States will inflate the next bubble . 
The Bush administration says the IMF is fine for now , and it sees no need for an expansion . 
But the Obama team will soon have its hands on the controls . 
A bigger IMF should be on its agenda . 
"
"`` This is a decisive moment for the global economy , '' President Bush declared yesterday in New York as leaders from the 20 largest economies headed toward Washington for an emergency meeting on the unfolding global economic crisis . 
It 's not only a decisive moment for the economy , but it 's the most decisive moment for American-style capitalism since July 1944 , when , after 22 days of negotiation at a remote lodge in the White Mountains of New Hampshire , leaders of 44 nations emerged with the blueprint for a new world financial order based on the principles of free markets , free trade and the free flow of capital . 
Although things have evolved considerably since that confab at Bretton Woods , the United States has remained the world 's most successful economy , and the rest of the world has moved , by reason of its example and its prodding , toward an embrace of its economic model . 
Now that is about to change . 
As the president acknowledged in his remarks yesterday , the United States , which has gone from the world 's largest creditor to its largest debtor , can no longer expect to dominate the institutions of international finance and will have to share power and influence with rapidly developing countries that generate more of the growth and have more of the world 's capital . 
Just as significantly , the rest of the world -- if not a majority of Americans -- is now convinced that the raw , unregulated , laissez-faire capitalism most closely associated with the American model has serious flaws and does not reliably produce the best outcome . 
From the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s to the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s to the Internet craze at the turn of the century to today 's economic conflagration , the past 20 years have provided ample evidence that uncontrolled flows of private capital have created massive booms and busts that have overwhelmed the financial system and destabilized the global economy . 
The booms have misallocated capital , widened the gulf between rich and poor , and eroded the norms of behavior that had contributed to social and political harmony . 
The busts have brought financial hardship and ruin to innocent businesses and households and saddled governments with huge debts that will take generations to pay off . 
In spite of these failings , President Bush remains largely in denial , an unrepentant cheerleader for American-style capitalism . 
As he sees it , the current crisis does not reflect any fundamental flaw in the American model but instead results from individual failures by lenders , borrowers , financial firms and regulators that can be minimized in the future , not through more regulation but through smarter regulation . 
And while he gives rhetorical support to the notion that international institutions may need to be updated and strengthened to deal with the crisis that might arise , he also makes clear that reform should not come at the expense of U.S. sovereignty or freedom of action . 
Up to a point , Bush 's defensiveness is understandable , given the comforting belief in many countries that lax American regulation and Wall Street greed were the sole causes of their own economic misfortunes . 
Anyone with a passing acquaintance with the real estate bubbles in Ireland and Spain , the stock market bubbles in China and India , and the loose lending practices by banks in Iceland and Russia would appreciate how misguided that view is . 
But there is also no denying that American-style capitalism has been undermined by its own success . 
In its present incarnation , it rewards manipulation over innovation and speculation over genuine value creation , resulting in massive misallocations of capital and the accumulation of unheard-of wealth in the hands of money managers and top corporate executives who are more lucky than they are skilled . 
No longer is it the entrepreneurial capitalism of Google and Amazon and Nucor Steel that animates the American imagination -- it is the financial capitalism of Enron and Drexel Burnham Lambert , of Goldman Sachs and the Blackstone Group , of publicly traded real estate investment trusts and multibillion-dollar hedge funds . 
Here in the United States , they have sucked up a disproportionate share of talent and capital , distorted compensation systems , and helped to perpetuate the false notion that companies exist solely to enrich their investors and investment bankers . 
And now , through the marvels of global financial markets , they have spread their toxic culture and products to economies across the globe . 
As they arrive in Washington , the challenge for global leaders is to find a way to tame a financial system that has not only corrupted American-style capitalism but also brought unwelcome instability to the global economy . 
The flaw in the old `` Washington consensus '' is that an unfettered flow of investment capital , particularly among countries with different currencies , is not the idea . 
While product and labor markets work remarkably well when they are left open and lightly-regulated , experience has now demonstrated that a different approach needs to be taken toward financial markets , which suffer from imperfect information , an abundance of moral hazard , and a tendency toward herd behavior and speculative excess . 
Creating a new architecture and regulatory framework for the global financial system is complicated and wonky and wo n't win anyone the next election . 
After the Asian financial crisis in 1998 , there was a lot of brave talk about updating the old Bretton Woods institutions , but petty politics and an improving economy got in the way , and nothing was ever done . 
Perhaps this time , the prospect of another global depression will focus the minds of world leaders and lead them to create a new model of capitalism that everyone can live with .

"Intelligence officials are warning that the deepening global financial crisis could weaken fragile governments in the world 's most dangerous areas and undermine the ability of the United States and its allies to respond to a new wave of security threats . 
U.S. government officials and private analysts say the economic turmoil has heightened the short-term risk of a terrorist attack , as radical groups probe for weakening border protections and new gaps in defenses . 
A protracted financial crisis could threaten the survival of friendly regimes from Pakistan to the Middle East while forcing Western nations to cut spending on defense , intelligence and foreign aid , the sources said . 
The crisis could also accelerate the shift to a more Asia-centric globe , as rising powers such as China gain more leverage over international financial institutions and greater influence in world capitals . 
Some of the more troubling and immediate scenarios analysts are weighing involve nuclear-armed Pakistan , which already was being battered by inflation and unemployment before the global financial tsunami hit . 
Since September , Pakistan has seen its national currency devalued and its hard-currency reserves nearly wiped out . 
Analysts also worry about the impact of plummeting crude prices on oil-dependent nations such as Yemen , which has a large population of unemployed youths and a history of support for militant Islamic groups . 
The underlying problems and trends -- especially regional instability and the waning influence of the West -- were already well established , but they are now `` being accelerated by the current global financial crisis , '' the nation 's top intelligence official , Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell , said in a recent speech . 
McConnell is among several top U.S. intelligence officials warning that deep cuts in military and intelligence budgets could undermine the country 's ability to anticipate and defend against new threats . 
Annual spending for U.S. intelligence operations currently totals $ 47.5 billion , a figure that does not include expensive satellites that fall under the Pentagon 's budget . 
At a recent gathering of geospatial intelligence officials and contractors in Nashville , the outlook for the coming fiscal cycles was uniformly grim : fewer dollars for buying and maintaining sophisticated spy systems . 
`` I worry where we 'll be five or 10 years from now , '' Charles Allen , intelligence director for the Department of Homeland Security , said in an interview . 
`` I am deeply worried that we will not have the funding necessary to operate and build the systems already approved . '' 
Intelligence officials say they have no hard evidence of a pending terrorist attack , and CIA Director Michael V. Hayden said in a news conference Thursday that his agency has not detected increased al-Qaeda communications or other signs of an imminent strike . 
But many government and private terrorism experts say the financial crisis has given al-Qaeda an opening , and judging from public statements and intercepted communications , senior al-Qaeda leaders are elated by the West 's economic troubles , which they regard as a vindication of their efforts and a sign of the superpower 's weakness . 
`` Al-Qaeda 's propaganda arm is constantly banging the drum saying that the U.S. economy is on the precipice -- and it 's the force of the jihadists that 's going to push us over the edge , '' said Bruce Hoffman , a former scholar-in-residence at the CIA and now a professor at Georgetown University . 
Whether terrorist leader Osama bin Laden is technically capable of another Sept. 11-style attack is unclear , but U.S. officials say he has traditionally picked times of transition to launch major strikes . 
The two major al-Qaeda-linked attacks on U.S. soil -- the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 and the 2001 hijackings -- occurred in the early months of new administrations .

"The long arm of the global financial crisis reached down into Morena Parada 's preschool classroom , where a little girl named Joeli Arias-Lopez painted bright green and orange splotches on an oversize easel and pronounced it a house . 
The 4-year-old was blissfully unaware that her school , the Child and Family Network Center , stays open in this converted warehouse with a grant from the now-foundering Freddie Mac Foundation . 
Or that without that money , which was expected last month , her school , filled with bright puzzles , toys , blocks and dedicated teachers , might end the year early or close down altogether . 
For 15 years the Freddie Mac Foundation , one of the largest corporate donors in the Washington region , has helped this little preschool , which charges nothing and serves about 150 needy children at six locations in Alexandria and Arlington County , stay afloat . 
But when the government announced in September that it had taken over the mortgage-finance giant to avert a collapse , officials put all charitable grants on hold , just two days before the preschool 's grant was expected to be approved . 
Now the preschool is in limbo . 
No one can tell its officials when or whether their grant , and those of several other area organizations that work primarily to help children and families , will come through . 
`` Which of these kids do you want to tell ca n't have an education ? '' 
asked Steve Nearman , the preschool 's board chairman , watching Joeli paint as other classmates sang `` Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star , '' played with blocks or traced butterflies with stencils . 
`` They 're not widgets . 
They 're the future of our community . '' 
The board is also considering cutting back on social work services it provides to help families become self-sufficient , scaling back English classes for parents or closing the school early , Nearman said . 
The school year normally ends late in June . 
Without Freddie Mac 's $ 250,000 , or about 14 percent of the school 's $ 1.8 million budget , the school might be lucky to make it to March . 
And with the economic downturn affecting everyone 's bottom line and donation habits , school officials do n't count on anyone else to pick up the slack . 
Chief Operating Officer Lee Jackson has a stack of bills on his desk . 
He pays the ones he must , such as the mortgage , utilities and food for the children 's meals . 
The others he `` prioritizes . '' 
`` People think about the financial crisis , and they think about corporate executives , '' said Barbara Fox Mason , the preschool 's director . 
`` They do n't realize how it 's affecting people from the other side of the street . '' 
The Freddie Mac money is usually the one donation Mason can depend on . 
In July , as in previous years , Mason met with a Freddie Mac official to craft the school 's grant proposal . 
Two days later , Freddie Mac called and told her to expect $ 350,000 . 
Although she had submitted a grant proposal for that amount , to be conservative , Mason budgeted $ 250,000 , which is what the school had received in previous years . 
`` It was n't irresponsible of us to put in our budget what they typically give us , '' she said . 
`` They were the rock . 
No one saw this coming . '' 
In early September , Mason was gathering the documentation required as part of the grant process , including information showing the school 's success . 
-LRB- Independent bench marks show the preschool 's students , who often start far behind their peers , progress at twice the national average through the year . -RRB- 
Then , Sept. 9 , two days after the federal government announced the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac takeovers , Mason got a call on her cellphone saying the Sept. 11 board meeting to approve grants had been postponed . 
And she has n't heard anything since . 
`` We 're under conservatorship , and as the conservator said in September , they 're reviewing our charitable investments , both for the company and the foundation , '' said Shawn Flaherty , spokeswoman for the Freddie Mac Foundation . 
`` Final decisions have n't been made . 
It 's an ongoing process . '' 
With the delay , Mason was forced to ask the City of Alexandria to release about $ 150,000 earmarked for the preschool now rather than in January . 
Those funds will keep the lights on through March , Mason said . 
`` Otherwise , we could n't make it . ''

"A Conversion in ` This Storm ' Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had a stern message for more than two dozen of the nation 's most powerful hedge fund managers gathered in the third-floor conference room near his office . 
Paulson told them it was time to begin regulating the opaque realm of hedge funds , reversing his long-held opposition . 
`` You should not be thinking about how to fight it but how to make it work , '' he recounted telling them at the meeting last month . 
One manager recalled muttering as he walked out : `` What happened to the Hank Paulson we knew ? '' 
With his 30-month tenure nearing its end , Paulson is leaving behind a legacy of federal interventionism that few would have expected from this former head of the investment giant Goldman Sachs . 
When he arrived in Washington as one of Wall Street 's most successful bankers , he was skeptical of government meddling . 
But as a regulator facing the worst financial crisis in nearly a century , he engineered a series of massive federal intrusions into the markets while persuading reluctant bank executives and influential politicians to fall in behind him . 
His evolution in thinking has extended even beyond these government programs to a set of new beliefs that he has yet to trumpet publicly or , in most cases , even share privately with colleagues on Wall Street and in the White House . 
While they , too , have changed some of their views on regulation , Paulson disclosed that he has traveled an even greater distance . 
`` My thinking has evolved a lot to the point where I 've seen regulation up close and personal , '' he said in a series of interviews . 
It was n't just the crisis that changed him . 
It was every bit as much sitting behind the desk where he fashioned new regulation . 
`` I 've realized how flawed it is and how imperfect , but how necessary it is , '' he added . 
Even though President Bush has been warning the next administration in speeches not to over-regulate the markets , Paulson said he will unveil proposals in coming weeks urging President-elect Barack Obama and the new Congress to endow the federal government with broad new authorities to take over any failing financial institution , not just banks . 
A Republican , Paulson would bring government into some of Wall Street 's most private quarters . 
He said banking regulators should have a major say in how financial firms compensate their executives and that the Federal Reserve should have the power to regulate any financial company it considers crucial , including hedge funds and private-equity firms . 
He added that the policy statement he crafted on hedge funds in January 2007 , which stated they should not be regulated , was wrong . 
In reshaping his philosophy , he has had to feel his way even as the once-familiar financial landscape shifted around him . 
Some senior government officials who worked with him said he invented much of the government 's response on the fly .

Dubai 's Eye-Popping Resort Debuts Despite Crisis Globe in a growing financial meltdown ? 
Great time to throw a $ 20 million party to open a $ 1.5 billion resort ! 
Last night in Dubai , in the United Arab Emirates -- the Vegas of the Arab world -- the Atlantis Resort opened with a massive party that laughed at the current economic crisis . 
Guests included Robert de Niro , Michael Jordan , Charlize Theron and an all-star cast of crisis-deniers . 
-LRB- CNBC 's Erin Burnett revealed on-air today that she got an invitation but did n't go . 
That 's just crazy talk , girlfriend . -RRB- 
The party concluded with a fireworks display that was supposed to be able to have been seen from space . 
That makes sense because the man-made , palm-shaped island on which the Atlantis sits , definitely can be seen from space . 
The rooms go for as much as $ 35,000 per night and come with their own butler and chef . 
Many have a glass wall view of the massive aquarium -LRB- sharks ! -RRB- 
at the heart of the hotel . 
Pretty much all you need to know about the resort is that it has a full-sized ziggurat inspired by the pre-Colombian peoples of Central America that doubles as ... a water slide . 
The massive terra-forming project has been called `` pharonic , '' but even the ancient Egyptian pharaohs did n't imagine a water slide down the side of the Great Pyramid at Giza . 
But it 's never too late . 
That is , if Egypt hopes to compete with Dubai for tourism dollars .

Obama Picks N.Y. Fed President Geithner as Treasury Secretary New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy F. Geithner . 
-LRB- Daniel Acker - Bloomberg News -RRB- President-elect Barack Obama has selected New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary , handing the post to a primary architect of the Bush administration 's response to the financial crisis , according to Democratic and industry officials yesterday . 
At 47 , he is the same age as Obama and would represent a generational change in the highest levels of Washington economic policymaking , heading a remarkably young team of White House economic advisers tasked with sorting out one of the worst financial messes since the Great Depression . 
A Democrat and a relative unknown outside the world of high finance , Geithner has worked closely with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to devise responses to the most critical events of the market turmoil , including the bailouts of the investment bank Bear Stearns and the insurance giant American International Group . 
Like Paulson , Geithner believes that the Treasury should be given vast powers to develop experimental strategies for responding to the crisis and the flexibility to abandon them if they do n't work . 
Geithner 's mentor is Lawrence H. Summers , 53 , a Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration who also was in the running for the job . 
Summers instead will go to the White House and serve as a senior economic adviser to Obama , according to a senior Democratic official familiar with the matter . 
Meanwhile , Obama is seriously considering a former opponent in the primary campaign , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , to head the Commerce Department , according to the official . 
Joining Summers in the White House would be Jason Furman , 38 , as a top economic adviser ; Peter R. Orszag , 39 , as White House budget director ; and Austan Goolsbee , 39 , on the president 's Council of Economic Advisers , sources familiar with the matter said . 
The rollout of the economic team is expected to take place in Chicago on Monday , according to a transition source who spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcements have not been made yet . 
As for the timing , this source said , `` Everything has been accelerated on the economic front because of the news of the last few months '' but not in reaction to any specific market trends this week . 
The problems facing the new administration are dire as the government 's effort to rescue the banking system falters . 
Yesterday , Goldman Sachs said it expected the economy to shrink even faster during the fourth quarter of this year , at a 5 percent annualized rate . 
The investment bank predicted that unemployment would soar to 9 percent by the end of next year . 
The stock markets cheered the would-be appointment of Geithner , who is well-known to Wall Street . 
The Dow Jones industrial average had been down as much as 1.4 percent in the morning . 
Around 3 p.m. , when news of Obama 's pick broke , the index shot up , ending the day 494.13 , or 6.5 percent , higher . 
`` Geithner is uniquely situated and has the business experience and the political experience and the policy experience to handle this crisis , '' said Scott Talbott , senior vice president of the Financial Services Roundtable , which lobbies for the nation 's largest financial firms . 
`` Everyone I talked to at the New York banks have had positive comments or no negative comments . '' 
He also has experience in addressing complex crises . 
In the late 1990s , he worked under Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Summers to guide the Clinton administration 's response to currency collapses in Russia , Mexico and Asia . 
In the last years of the administration , Summers became Treasury secretary and Geithner was promoted to undersecretary . 
Geithner `` will get a very favorable response in the Senate , '' said Sen. Kent Conrad -LRB- D-N.D. -RRB- , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee . 
`` You saw the relief rally in the market today ... These are the kind of people you want with their hand on the till in a storm . 
And we 're in a Category 4 . '' 
Others wondered whether Geithner , who has a youthful manner , could inspire confidence in the markets .

"Traders work at the Citigroup kiosk on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . 
The company 's stock price has dropped 60 percent this week . 
-LRB- By Keith Bedford -- Bloomberg News -RRB- Citigroup executives have launched a campaign to convince investors and analysts that the company is in a strong position to weather the economic crisis . 
-LRB- By Preston Keres -- The Washington Post -RRB- A defiant Citigroup proclaimed itself in good health yesterday even as its stock price completed a one-week , 60 percent swan dive , highlighting renewed investor concern about the long-term prospects of the nation 's largest banks . 
Lenders are facing massive losses across a wide range of businesses as the economy unravels at a quickening pace , and investors have concluded that some of the largest banks , including Citigroup , will need to raise more money . 
Some investors also appear to be betting that the Bush administration is out of time , tools and willpower to save another bank . 
Simon Johnson , former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , compared the market movement to an attempt by speculators to collapse a foreign currency by betting that the government wo n't invest enough money to reverse the decline . 
`` The market is testing Mr. Paulson , '' said Johnson , now a professor of entrepreneurship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 
`` They basically have $ 60 billion left to last them two months , and now they have to deal with some increasingly serious problems . '' 
Citigroup 's executives launched a fierce campaign yesterday to convince investors and analysts , government officials , and even their own employees that the company is in a strong position to weather the economic crisis . 
Chief executive Vikram Pandit accused investors of `` fear-mongering , '' according to a person who heard him speak on a conference call with employees yesterday . 
Federal regulators are watching the situation and are in contact with the company 's executives but are not taking an active role , believing that Citigroup is in much stronger financial condition than banks that have recently collapsed , people familiar with the matter said . 
The government remains committed to preventing the collapse of any large financial institution , those sources said , speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly . 
Citigroup 's board met yesterday to discuss options , including the sale of business units , according to people familiar with the situation . 
Pandit has said that he strongly opposes the sale of core units such as the Smith Barney brokerage . 
Citigroup is also pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend short-selling , the practice of betting on a decline in a company 's stock price , which can create its own momentum as investors drive down prices , according to industry and government sources . 
The company has the support of leading industry trade groups , but two industry sources who had been in contact with the SEC about the matter said regulators are disinclined to comply . 
The SEC banned short-selling on hundreds of financial stocks for several weeks earlier this fall . 
But the agency concluded the initial effort was counterproductive , because it led some large investors to sell all their holdings and leave the market , undermining the stated purpose of shoring up stock prices . 
Investors dropped Citigroup 's stock to $ 3.77 a share in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , the lowest price since 1992 . 
Bank of America fell to $ 11.47 , its lowest share price since 1995 . 
J.P. Morgan Chase fell to $ 22.72 , its lowest price since 2002 . 
Citigroup 's stock price has little direct , short-term impact on the company . 
The concern , however , is that Citigroup 's customers and business partners will accept the stock market 's judgment about the company 's health and will begin to withdraw and withhold money from the bank . 
A similar process has driven other banks to the point of collapse , including Washington Mutual , Wachovia and National City . 
The declining stock price also limits the company 's ability to raise money by issuing shares , or to buy other companies using shares . 
Citigroup had discussed buying Chevy Chase Bank of Bethesda but no longer appears able to close the deal , according to people familiar with the situation .

"Fed Has Giant , and Opaque , Role in Financial Crisis Aid Wall Street analysts , congressional overseers and the media have parsed every detail of the Treasury Department 's financial rescue program -- $ 250 billion and counting . 
Largely outside public view , however , the Federal Reserve is lending far more than that amount -- $ 893 billion , roughly the equivalent of the annual economic output of Mexico -- to help a wide range of institutions weather the economic storm . 
As of last week , the Fed 's loans included $ 507 billion to banks , $ 50 billion to investment firms , $ 70 billion for money market mutual funds , and $ 266 billion to companies that use a form of short-term debt called commercial paper . 
It is considering a new program that would make billions more available to prop up consumer lending : auto loans , credit cards and the like . 
In lending these vast sums , the Fed is essentially substituting its own unlimited ability to supply cash for that of private markets , which are not functioning normally . 
The central bank is even fulfilling some of the original goals of the Treasury Department 's $ 700 billion rescue program by allowing financial institutions to use securities that are difficult to sell as collateral for loans . 
`` The existing system of lending is broken , '' said David Shulman , a senior economist at the UCLA Anderson Forecast , which analyzes economic trends . 
`` The Fed is coming in to do that lending . 
That 's why they call it the lender of last resort . '' 
But unlike the Treasury 's rescue package , which has elaborate disclosure requirements and oversight mechanisms , the Fed lending is occurring quietly and at the discretion of its five governors , as well as top officials of the 12 regional Fed banks . 
Timothy F. Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Obama administration 's expected nominee for Treasury secretary , has been a leading architect of the new lending programs . 
Following a long-standing practice designed to protect investor and depositor confidence in the institutions it deals with , the Fed refuses to name the banks and other companies accessing the cash . 
It has also declined to specify which assets institutions have pledged as collateral in exchange for loans , a decision that has drawn skeptical questioning from Capitol Hill and at least one lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act . 
Fed officials argue that any disclosure along those lines would create a stigma for banks and others that need to borrow from the Fed , making the programs less effective at jump-starting lending . 
`` There 's a concern that if the name is put in the newspaper that such and such bank came to the Fed to borrow overnight for a good reason , that people might begin to worry : Is this bank credit-worthy ? '' 
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress last week . 
`` And that might create a stigma , a problem , and might cause banks to be unwilling to borrow . '' 
Bernanke also said there is little chance taxpayers will lose money on most of that lending , because the central bank lends money only to institutions it views as sound and requires that the collateral borrowers put up be worth more than the amount of the loan . 
Outside experts generally agree that Bernanke has been prudent in his decision-making , but they note that Fed lending to support the purchase of Bear Stearns and the government takeover of American International Group entails greater risk than the central bank usually takes on . 
The expansion in Fed lending has come in the form of numerous new programs to inject cash into the financial system , attempts to combat a crisis in which banks and other firms are hoarding it . 
To enact those steps , the Fed has increased the size of its balance sheet and replaced the ultra-safe U.S. government bonds it normally keeps on its books with loans to banks and others . 
A year ago , the central bank had assets of $ 868 billion , of which about 90 percent was in Treasuries . 
Last week , it had assets of $ 2.2 trillion on its books , of which 22 percent was in Treasuries . 
Much of the remainder represents the new lending to banks and other financial institutions . 
Even the weekly report that summarizes the Fed 's financial position has grown -- to eight pages from four pages a year ago .

"'' Follow The World Desk On : Chiefs of World Bank and International Monetary Fund to Miss United Nations Forum UNITED NATIONS , Nov. 24 -- The chiefs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have declined to participate in a major U.N. conference next week on the financing of development assistance for poor countries , upsetting an effort to secure high-level attendance at a meeting aimed at goading the beleaguered financial giants into stepping up aid . 
World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick and IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn confirmed Monday that they will not lead their agencies ' delegation at a four-day conference in Doha , Qatar , beginning Saturday . 
But they will send senior advisers and remain committed to the goals of the conference , which will be attended by all of the 192 U.N. members , said officials from the two financial institutions . 
Some top U.N. officials were visibly infuriated by what they viewed as a snub of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon . 
One official accused Zoellick of trying to ensure that the major decisions on the financial crisis would be made by the less unwieldy Group of 20 nations , which met in Washington on Nov. 15 to try to coordinate international response to the meltdown . 
`` It 's fair to say that the secretary general was very disappointed and does n't understand completely '' why they will not be attending , the official said . 
Ban had envisioned the Doha meeting as a forum that would allow a broader group of countries , including some of the poorest , to have a say in the way the economic powerhouses respond to the crisis . 
He hoped the leaders of the main financial institutions would help him drive home the message that donor countries must not reduce development assistance , officials said . 
Donor countries acknowledge that `` there is a moral obligation not to cut back because this crisis , after all , was not made in the poorest countries in the world , '' said Kemal Dervis , executive director of the U.N. Development Program . 
`` It was due to some failures of markets and of regulations in the richer parts of the world . '' 
The Doha meeting is a follow-up to the 2002 International Conference on Financing for Development , in which more than 50 world leaders , including President Bush , gathered in Monterrey , Mexico , to galvanize international support for aid to poor countries . 
But the Doha review conference comes as the world is facing its worst economic crisis in a generation . 
Dervis said that there will be a deep recession in 2009 and that every industrialized nation will see its gross domestic product shrink by 0.5 percent to 1 percent . 
`` It 's clear we 're heading toward a very difficult 2009 , '' he said , referring to the economy . 
`` This kind of volatility has never been seen before . '' 
Oscar de Rojas , executive secretary of the conference , said the crisis has had a chilling effect on negotiations leading to the summit . 
He said delegates negotiating a 96-page outcome document in the basement of U.N. headquarters this week remain deadlocked on several issues , including language calling on states to increase their commitments to aid or accelerating spending on prior commitments . 
He said negotiations probably will resume in Doha . 
Rojas said Monday that Zoellick provided no formal explanation for why he will not attend the conference . 
Senior U.N. officials said he had informed Ban that the gathering conflicted with Thanksgiving plans . 
One U.N. official said Zoellick has been pressing world leaders to restrict deliberations on the financial crisis to the G-20 countries . 
In a letter to G-20 members , Zoellick proposed they set up a steering group of finance ministers , drawn from top industrialized and developed nations that control most of the world 's GDP and energy production , to manage the global response to the crisis . 
`` While bringing the rising economic powers to the table is clearly necessary , I suggest considering something new , not just an expansion of the old , '' Zoellick wrote . 
Geetanjali Chopra , a World Bank spokeswoman , said Zoellick decided he would send two top bank officials , chief economist Justin Yifu Lin of China and Marwan Muasher of Jordan , to Doha as part of a policy to increase representation by officials from the developing world . 
Strauss-Kahn , the IMF chief , had committed several months ago to attend the conference but decided to pull out sometime in the past two weeks . 
An IMF official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said Strauss-Kahn was overwhelmed with work implementing the policy initiatives agreed to by the G-20 this month . 
The IMF will send an eight-member delegation to the meeting , led by Deputy Managing Director Murilo Portugal , spokesman Niels H. Buenemann said .

"Brazil 's Auto Industry Feels Impact of Financial Crisis The General Motors plant at Sao Caetano do Sul added a third shift in March . 
Since then , the company has instituted mandatory vacations to slow output . 
-LRB- By Paulo Fridman -- Bloomberg News -RRB- SAO CAETANO , Brazil -- The car builders wistfully recall those heady days . 
The General Motors factory plowed ahead at full tilt . 
Stamped , welded and painted , new Chevrolets flew off the line in greater numbers each month . 
The company added a third shift in March : 1,600 new employees . 
Assembly-line painter Jair Nery de Andrade used his 11 percent employee discount in February to buy himself a new Chevrolet Corsa Classic . 
`` I would n't buy it now , '' he said . 
`` I would n't feel secure about making that kind of commitment . '' 
The situation over the past couple of months at the GM of Brazil plant in Sao Caetano do Sul , as in many parts of Brazil 's economy , was not a crash , or a collapse , or even a crisis , but rather a collective whiplash . 
A sharp lowering of expectations . 
These past few years have been boom times for Brazil , and the auto industry was no exception . 
Newfound prosperity driven by high commodity prices has fostered an expanding middle class -- a group more than willing to seize easy credit terms and buy up automobiles by the thousands . 
That changed in a flash when the shock waves of the U.S. financial crisis radiated worldwide . 
As credit dried up in early October and it became more expensive to secure car loans , Brazil 's stock market plunged and its currency rapidly lost value . 
Automobile sales nationwide fell 11 percent from September to October , the first monthly decline for the industry in five years , according to the Brazilian automakers association , Anfavea . 
`` It happened practically all at once , '' said Ivan Favarin , the sales manager at a GM dealership in a middle-class neighborhood of Sao Paulo , where sales dropped more than 30 percent in October . 
`` It was a mix of the decline in credit but also , I think , a psychological effect : People did n't want to commit themselves without first seeing if there were any measures coming to combat this situation . '' 
The government stepped in with a $ 3.5 billion aid package for the auto industry by funding banks to boost the amount of credit available for car loans . 
The Brazilian auto industry 's ability to weather the downturn will test the assertions of those who say the country 's burgeoning and diversifying economy is better prepared to fend off a U.S.-generated crisis than in earlier years . 
In neighboring Argentina , the auto sector , which was one of the primary industries that helped the nation rebound from its 2001 financial crisis , has suffered layoffs , reductions in hours and compulsory vacations . 
Production was down 7.7 percent in October compared with the same month last year . 
Thousands of Argentine auto workers marched in downtown Buenos Aires last month to protest reduced salaries and job cuts . 
Unlike Brazil , where most cars produced are sold internally , 60 percent of auto production in Argentina is exported . 
`` So when there is a lack of international demand , we have a problem , '' said Mariano Lamothe , an economist at Abeceb.com , a Buenos Aires consulting firm . 
`` The falling demand from Brazil is what is hitting Argentine carmakers the hardest . '' 
In Brazil in October , interest rates rose from about 1.2 percent a month to more than 2 percent . 
Before the crisis , people were buying cars fully financed , with monthly payments that consumed half their income . 
Then the rules changed . 
Now customers ' income must be three times the monthly payment or they face a required 50 percent cash down payment , Favarin said . 
`` The banks are now being much more strict about the criteria for approval for the loan , and if people ca n't meet those criteria , they require '' a down payment , he said . 
With falling sales , a downturn in production followed . 
At two General Motors plants outside Sao Paulo , in Sao Caetano do Sul and Sao Jose dos Campos , the number of automobiles produced rose steadily this year to a high of 42,783 in July , before dropping to 29,240 in October . 
As have several auto companies in Brazil , GM has instituted mandatory vacations during which the entire plant stops working to slow output .

"China Can Do the Most Good for the World by Putting Its Own House in Order This should be China 's time to shine . 
The country is sitting on almost $ 2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and may post a 9 percent growth rate this year , probably the highest of any nation . 
In the midst of a global financial crisis , the world has come to China 's doorstep seeking leadership . 
Yet China 's leaders have largely kept the door shut , arguing that Beijing can do the most good for the world by putting its own house in order . 
China wants to be a responsible partner , not a global leader . 
Many in the United States have assumed that China wants to ascend to superpower status ; and what better time for Beijing to step up ? 
China matters more to the world every day -- not just on trade and finance but on climate change , food safety , nonproliferation and other global challenges . 
Yet China 's leaders are right : They need to focus on the home front before they extend themselves globally , for their own sake and for ours . 
Above all , China 's leaders need to sort out where they are going politically . 
It is hard to lead globally when your domestic political system is in massive transition -- or , worse , turmoil . 
Beijing faces more than 90,000 protests annually as a result of endemic corruption and ongoing crises in public health and the environment . 
Exports , the lifeblood of the Chinese economy , are falling ; layoffs are already in the tens of thousands , and China 's stock market has lost two-thirds of its value over the past year . 
Chinese media report daily on a stream of new regulations -- to limit the ability of factories to fire workers , to manage state-run reporting or to restructure the public health bureaucracy . 
Yet all this tinkering at the margins has failed to reassure the Chinese people , or many outside the country , that the government has a clear plan for its political and economic future . 
And until China 's leaders address their domestic issues , we do n't want them playing a larger role abroad . 
Their political system is in desperate need of transparency , official accountability and the rule of law . 
Before China 's political institutions are in good shape , Chinese leadership abroad would probably introduce as many problems as it solves . 
The global financial crisis , for example , has sparked calls for Beijing to take a greater stake in the International Monetary Fund . 
On its face , given China 's impressive balance sheet , this makes sense . 
Yet Premier Wen Jiabao 's calls for IMF reform may signal a challenge to the fund 's efforts to promote transparency and accountability in the countries to which it lends ; China has routinely resisted calls for its foreign assistance to be managed in a transparent manner . 
In addition to developing the political capacity for leadership , the time Beijing spends getting its house in order would allow China to develop the economic wherewithal to lead . 
Leadership means setting an example and often entails political or economic sacrifice at home for the greater good abroad . 
China has demonstrated little inclination toward such sacrifice , partly because it does not believe it has the economic capacity to do so . 
Put another way , it needs time to expand its economy . 
On the issue of global climate change , for example , China is a strong supporter of -- and major beneficiary of -- the current international climate framework , and it is committed to the next round of negotiations . 
It has launched a domestic initiative to reduce the amount of energy it uses per unit of GDP and increase the role of renewables in its energy mix . 
Yet China avoids the tough economic choices embodied in adopting hard targets and timetables to reduce emissions , and it has sought free access to clean technology through a global fund supported by the developed world . 
Responsible player , yes ; global leader , no. . 
Acknowledging China 's reluctance to lead does n't mean the world should do nothing but wait . 
China 's path to good governance at home and leadership abroad will be fundamentally of its own making , yet our nation and others can help the process through cooperation where possible and pressure where necessary . 
Institutions such as the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue provide a framework for bilateral cooperation on economic , environmental and energy issues . 
The dialogue is young but has the potential to make significant advances on these critical issues . 
Meanwhile , on time-sensitive topics such as food safety , climate change or Darfur , the United States has to be prepared to work with the rest of the world to press China more rather than less aggressively to rethink or reform its policies . 
Above all , the United States can do the most good by getting its own house in order . 
We have been free-riding alongside China on global efforts to combat climate change . 
Our lack of good governance domestically has increased our vulnerability to food and product safety crises and precipitated a global financial crisis . 
Our political institutions and financial bearings are not broken , but they have been seriously weakened . 
We and the world will pay a steep price until this country resumes a position from which it too can lead .

"France Plans $ 33 Billion in Economic Stimulus ; Central Banks Cut Rates PARIS , Dec. 4 -- Facing a drastic slowdown , France announced a $ 33 billion economic stimulus plan Thursday , including cash payments to the poor , a bigger rebate on new-car purchases and a speedup in high-cost public works projects . 
The effort , outlined by President Nicolas Sarkozy , was the latest in a series of programs undertaken by European governments to mitigate economic fallout from the financial crisis that migrated across the Atlantic in September , shaking the continent 's banking system and strangling hopes for growth . 
Also Thursday , the European Central Bank , with the same objective in mind , announced in Frankfurt that its prime interest rate would be shaved by three-quarters of a percentage point , to 2.5 percent , the largest cut in its history and the second since the crisis erupted . 
Simultaneously , the Bank of England announced a full-percentage-point cut in its interest rate , pushing it down to 2 percent . 
The decision marked an effort by Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's government to act in concert with the 15 countries that use the euro to put more cash into the hands of European business owners and households . 
`` The economies are in sync , and meetings happen with the same frequency , and they all reached the same decision , '' said Andrew Scott , an economics professor at the London Business School . 
The extra government spending in France , one of the 15 euro countries , implied a willingness to assume further public debt , already estimated at more than 3 percent of the French economy , and contradicted Sarkozy 's campaign pledges to cut official spending and produce a leaner government . 
But officials emphasized that the measures were designed to be temporary and that much of the money could be considered investment that would bring growth . 
`` We do not have a choice , '' Sarkozy said in a speech at Douai , in northern France . 
`` Doing nothing would cost us a lot more . '' 
Critics , however , accused Sarkozy of doing too little , too late . 
`` These are baby measures , not in proportion to the problem , '' said S gol ne Royal , the Socialist Party candidate who lost to Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential election . 
Sarkozy delivered his speech next to a Renault plant , signifying his recognition that the auto industry has been hit particularly hard since the financial crisis dried up credit , imperiled jobs and sapped consumer confidence . 
Sales of new cars in France sank by 14 percent in November , according to the French Automobile Manufacturers Association , despite discounts of up to 20 percent . 
Several companies and parts suppliers have announced layoffs and cutbacks in work hours . 
Against that background , Sarkozy announced a rise to $ 1,250 in the government-financed rebate for people purchasing a new car to replace an old vehicle . 
A smaller rebate was already in place as an environmental measure . 
Since taking office in May 2007 , Sarkozy has promoted an effort to have French industry invest heavily in environmentally friendly products , predicting they will be highly coveted in the years to come . 
French businesses have been allowed tax write-offs for high-tech research , particularly research that focuses on the clean-air industry . 
That arrangement was enhanced in the stimulus package announced in Douai ; officials said more than $ 12 billion of the new stimulus package would go to quicker reimbursement of tax credits for research-oriented investment by small and medium-size businesses . 
`` Our response to the crisis is investment , '' Sarkozy said . 
About a third of the stimulus package was earmarked for public works , including railroad infrastructure and low-cost housing projects . 
Most of those initiatives were planned , anyway , aides acknowledged , but the schedule was moved up to get money into the economy faster and maintain employment . 
The Finance Ministry 's National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies reported Thursday that unemployment rose by a tenth of a percentage point in the third quarter and now affects 7.3 percent of the workforce in mainland France . 
The numbers confirmed anecdotal reports of job losses across the country since the slowdown began . 
The cash payment to the poor was set at $ 250 . 
It was promised for the first quarter of 2009 , disappointing some who had expected it to be disbursed in time for Christmas . 
Officials said the main targets were the working poor and laid-off workers , who could be expected to spend the entire sum quickly . 
Sarkozy announced a separate set of measures Wednesday to boost government aid for the destitute .

"'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | Icelanders protest outside the parliament in Reykjavik , demanding elections for a new government . 
The currency 's sudden decline is making the country an international destination for shopping as well as for more-traditional tourism activities . 
-LRB- By Brynjar Gunnarsson -- Associated Press -RRB- Iceland gets less than five hours of sunlight a day in winter , but bookings from the United States are up 90 percent . 
-LRB- Visit Reykjavik -RRB- Two months ago , Iceland , a cold and ruggedly beautiful chunk of volcanic rock on the edge of the Arctic Circle , was one of the world 's most expensive nations . 
Then the global financial crisis hit , the country went bust , and almost overnight the Icelandic currency , the krona , lost half its value and prices of everything from boots to beer returned to earth . 
Now , as thousands of angry Icelanders protest in the streets over disappearing wealth and jobs , their nation 's tourism industry is enjoying a boom in bargain-hunters . 
People from Boston to Beijing , many of them younger and less-affluent travelers who said they had always considered Iceland prohibitively expensive , are filling planes heading to Reykjavik , the world 's northernmost capital . 
Many are even coming for weekend shopping trips to a city that , until recently , made the glitzy shopping districts of New York and London seem reasonable . 
`` You do n't do this every day -- it 's cool , '' said Andonis Marden , 19 , a student at Boston 's Northeastern University , who was standing near one of Iceland 's famous hot-water spouts as the geyser blasted steam 50 feet into the frigid air . 
`` I would have come when I was older and had more money , but now it 's cheap , '' said Marden , who heard about Iceland 's sudden affordability in an e-mail alert , paid $ 475 for round-trip airfare and spent the Thanksgiving weekend in a $ 23-a-night Reykjavik youth hostel . 
Officials at Icelandair said bookings from the United States are up 90 percent over last year for the period from December through next March . 
Bookings from Britain for the same period are up 48 percent . 
Those spikes in reservations are especially unusual because winter , when Iceland gets less than five hours of sunlight a day , is generally the slowest season for tourism . 
The Blue Lagoon , a large hot spring powered by the island 's potent geothermal energy , had its busiest November ever , despite Iceland 's worst financial crisis in modern history . 
`` It 's a peculiar situation that the economy has created an opportunity to come , but people are grabbing at it , '' said Blue Lagoon chief executive Grimur Saemundsen .

"Unable to Escape Global Crisis , South American Nations Take Financial Action RIO DE JANEIRO , Dec. 9 -- It began with denial , as the leaders of several South American countries insisted their high-stepping economies could weave their way through the financial troubles shaking the United States . 
Then there was anger that the world 's financial system was being run by apparent gamblers from the same powerful countries that have always lectured South America on the need to be prudent and honest . 
And now , in more and more countries in this region , there is acceptance . 
On Monday , Alan Garc a , the Peruvian president who was talking about a `` crisis of prosperity '' as recently as last month , announced a $ 3.4 billion bailout package to help a national economy that has been among the hemisphere 's fastest growing in recent years . 
Four days earlier , Argentine President Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner announced a $ 3.8 billion package of low-cost loans to increase consumer demand and help exporters , paid for with money from the country 's newly nationalized pension system . 
Brazil , the region 's largest economy , has spent $ 3.5 billion to help its struggling auto sector as its stock market and currency have crashed . 
`` It 's been slow , but I think there 's a growing awareness that the region is entering a new era and the last five or six years have been sort of an anomaly , '' said Michael Shifter , vice president for policy at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington . 
`` I think in the next couple years things will be a lot tighter . 
There might be some regrets they did n't take more advantage of these boom times . '' 
As the prices of oil , minerals and agricultural products have dropped -- the backbones of many Latin American economies -- credit has become harder to secure and demand has abated . 
Several of Latin America 's most promising economies are now predicting sharply lower growth rates . 
Ecuador is considering defaulting on $ 3.8 billion in foreign debt . 
In Venezuela , where the price of oil has fallen to less than $ 35 a barrel from $ 140 in July , President Hugo Ch vez has said his government would cut the budget , including officials ' salaries , in response to the crisis . 
Ch vez has also pushed for a production cut among OPEC members to boost oil prices , which could undermine already weak neighboring economies . 
A consultancy based in Washington , PFC Energy , said Venezuela needs to have oil prices above $ 95 a barrel to maintain its economic stability . 
Some political analysts predict the Argentine measures -- including consumer loans for appliances and new cars , and a decrease in export taxes on wheat and corn -- may not improve the gloomy forecasts . 
Gross domestic product is projected to contract by more than 1 percent next year , according to some estimates , after five consecutive years of growing by more than 8 percent . 
Fern ndez de Kirchner told a group of business leaders last week , `` Perhaps we Argentines are going to have to suffer a part of this tragedy . '' 
Argentina 's trouble securing loans to boost government spending has forced it to resort to taking money from the once-private pension system , which amounts to `` redirecting money that was already in the financial system , '' said Federico Thomsen , a political and economic analyst in Buenos Aires . 
`` It serves political purposes for the government to show they are doing something during the crisis , but the truth is , I think the Argentine government can not do too much about it , '' he said . 
`` The reason why governments try to build up trust and credit in the good times is so that during the bad times they have money . 
Argentina has not done that , and of course , the government can not admit that it has no tools today because of its own shortcomings . '' 
In Peru , Garc a had been optimistic about Peru 's ability to maintain its rapid growth through the financial crisis .

"With Close Ties to Wall St. , Hoboken , N.J. , Feels Strain of Financial Crisis Jonathan Gordon had to leave Hoboken , N.J. , after losing his financial-sector job . 
He now lives in San Antonio . 
-LRB- By Joel Salcido For The Washington Post -RRB- The Manhattan skyline as seen from Hoboken . 
The city 's proximity to Wall Street helped it become a trendy place to live . 
-LRB- By Mark Lennihan -- Associated Press -RRB- HOBOKEN , N.J. -- Jonathan Gordon is a survivor . 
On Sept. 11 , 2001 , Gordon , a longtime Hoboken resident , was working for the financial firm Instinet on the 13th floor of the World Trade Center 's North Tower when the first hijacked plane hit . 
He recalls clambering out of the burning tower `` one step at a time , '' and reaching the sidewalk only to look up at the second plane striking the South Tower . 
He had to run to avoid being hit by debris . 
`` I view it as a relatively good day because I got out unscathed -- a number of my friends did n't , '' Gordon said . 
This year , Wall Street experienced another type of crisis : a financial meltdown that saw some of New York 's most storied investment and banking houses fail , be forced into mergers or get rescued through government bailouts . 
This time , Gordon 's luck ran out . 
In March , his new firm , Bear Stearns , was taken over by J.P. Morgan Chase . 
The day after Labor Day , Gordon returned to the office after two weeks off for surgery and was told he was being dismissed . 
With tens of thousands of layoffs in the financial sector and few jobs to be found , Gordon , 55 , has been forced to leave Hoboken , his home of the past 24 years and where he had become well known as a community activist and constant presence at City Council budget meetings . 
Late last month , Gordon resettled in San Antonio . 
`` I found a job -- a lot of my friends are n't so lucky , '' he said in a telephone interview from his new home . 
He said he knows of other colleagues from Bear Stearns who have relocated for jobs in other parts of the country . 
Gordon said he will miss Hoboken , calling it `` a wonderful community . '' 
Speaking of the city 's inextricable link to the fortunes of the financial capital across the Hudson River , he said , `` When Wall Street sneezes , Hoboken catches cold . '' 
A generation ago , Hoboken was probably best known as the birthplace of Frank Sinatra and the gritty setting for the Marlon Brando film `` On the Waterfront . '' 
But since the boom days on Wall Street during the heady and prosperous 1990s , Hoboken has been able to reinvent itself as a city of pricey high-rise condos , top-rated restaurants and thriving , often raucous , nightlife -- all based on its proximity to Wall Street , a few minutes away by ferry or PATH commuter trains . 
Its most famous resident now is New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning . 
Just across the river from Manhattan , Hoboken was often jokingly called New York 's sixth borough . 
But being tied so closely to Wall Street also carries huge vulnerabilities , as Hoboken saw with the 2001 terrorist attacks . 
Hoboken was the area , by Zip code , to suffer the largest number of casualties per capita , with 57 residents killed . 
-LRB- The official numbers vary because some Hoboken victims carried driver 's licenses from other jurisdictions . -RRB- 
`` We 're a city which is a square mile with 50,000 people living in it , but in the greater metropolitan area , we had the largest loss of life in the world , '' said Hoboken Mayor David Roberts , who was mayor on Sept. 11 , 2001 . 
`` That 's not a laudable statistic , '' he said . 
`` It 's just a fact of life that we are so linked to the city . 
We are so linked to Wall Street , and so many of our people are in the financial industry . '' 
"
"It was Wall Street 's version of an inside joke : Take a motley collection of largely unwanted assets , repackage them into a new set of bonds , and name it after the pristine white-sand beaches of an exclusive New Jersey town where Katharine Hepburn once summered . 
No one is laughing now . 
The Merrill Lynch bond deal known as Mantoloking has ended up with a different punch line : proof of the frenzied , foolhardy drive for upfront fees that helped bring down the world 's financial markets and trigger the largest federal bailout in history . 
Wall Street firms thought they had a surefire way to profit from the booming real estate market without much risk to their companies . 
They engaged in a kind of financial alchemy , creating a trillion-dollar chain of securities on the back of subprime mortgages and other loans , which were sold to investors in private offerings that no government regulator scrutinized . 
With these deals , known as collateralized debt obligations , the world glimpsed the raw power of unchecked financial markets operating full-throttle to the point of self-destruction . 
The cascading losses on CDO bonds have undermined the solvency of several large banks and obliterated the trust that is the bedrock of all functioning markets . 
The debacle also has called into question the competence of Wall Street , the independence of bond-rating firms , the prudence of insurers and the foresight of regulators . 
Deals like Mantoloking were `` the height of lunacy , '' says Joshua Rosner , a bond market expert who issued multiple warnings about lax lending standards during the past seven years , earning him status as an early prophet of the credit crisis . 
So many of these bonds have become untouchable that they stand in the way of restoring the flow of credit that the global financial system needs to operate and that the economy needs to climb out of recession . 
Experts say that firm prices must be established for the bonds -- no matter how low they may go -- so the system can clear itself of these toxic assets . 
Not only did no government agency or official try to stop the bond deals as they were selling , but Washington cheered this new market because it expanded homeownership -- at least until defaults started piling up . 
`` Wall Street and Washington acted in concert to provide an artificial sense of a safety net , '' said Julian Mann , a Los Angeles-based investment portfolio manager for First Pacific Advisors who looked over many CDO offerings . 
Like many others , Mann faults Washington for failing to rein in the subprime market , with its many no-documentation , teaser-rate loans that extended credit to those who could n't afford it and invited fraud . 
He also blames Wall Street for relying on elaborate models that predicted that default rates would be low when common sense screamed otherwise . 
The incoming Obama administration has pledged to overhaul the regulatory structure , which could lead to an examination of the legal thinking that has embraced CDOs as `` private placements . '' 
Sold from trusts often organized in the Cayman Islands , the bonds were listed only on the Irish Stock Exchange , of all places . 
An official there readily acknowledged that the exchange handled no trades in the bonds . 
No prices were made public , and documents on file at the exchange were available only to those who purchased the bonds . 
The only public reporting of the deals were the gains or losses on the securities recorded by their owners . 
Under this system , regulators had no official window into the bigger picture -- that these private securities had grown so numerous and involved so many companies that they posed a collective risk to the entire financial system . 
"
"Thursday , December 18 , 2008 ; 11:33 AM President-elect Barack Obama today made a trio of appointments to his economic team , including new stock and commodity market regulators he says will be charged with cracking down on `` the culture of greed and scheming '' that has undermined public trust in the financial industry . 
In a Chicago news conference , Obama named securities industry veteran Mary L. Schapiro to head the Securities and Exchange Commission , and announced former Treasury official Gary Gensler as his choice to head the Commodities Futures Trading Commission . 
He also named Georgetown University law professor Daniel K. Tarullo to one of two open seats on the Federal Reserve Board . 
Tarullo is a top economic policy adviser to Obama , and held several jobs in the Clinton administration related to international trade and regulatory policy . 
Announcing the appointments of Schapiro and Gensler , Obama said the two will be central to what he called one of his `` top legislative priorities '' coming into office -- an overhaul of the system for regulating markets . 
In the context of a broad recession , a global crisis in financial markets , and an emerging Wall Street scandal that regulators failed to catch , Obama said that the country is `` frustrated that there is not a lot of adult supervision . '' 
His new team , he said , would create `` a 21st century regulatory framework . '' 
The SEC 's failure to detect Bernard L. Madoff 's alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme before it was revealed last week has prompted even current chairman Christophr Cox to question the agency 's performance . 
Schapiro , who would be the first woman to chair the SEC on more than an interim basis , will help spearhead `` a crackdown on the culture of greed and scheming that has led us to this day of reckoning ... We are going to ensure openness , accountability and transparency in our markets so people can trust the value of the financial products they are buying , '' Obama said . 
Schapiro , a Wall Street regulator for 20 years with a reputation for tenacity , is likely to push the SEC to become more aggressive in policing the financial industry and advocating the agency 's interests as lawmakers push for an overhaul of the financial regulatory structure , according to former officials and colleagues . 
`` If there is anybody who is going to reinvigorate the SEC , it is Mary , '' said David M. Becker , a former general counsel at the agency . 
`` I have no doubt that with her leading the SEC , it will show its teeth whenever necessary . '' 
Schapiro , 53 , has a history of attracting support from Republicans and Democrats . 
President Ronald Reagan appointed her as a commissioner at the SEC , where she served for six years and eventually was named acting chair by President Bill Clinton . 
He later made her the chief of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission . 
The fact that she has led both agencies could make it easier for the Obama administration to merge the functions of the two agencies as part of a broad regulatory overhaul expected next year . 
Key regulators and lawmakers have advocated such a move , arguing that the bifurcation of duties created a gap in oversight that contributed to the financial crisis . 
Schapiroheads the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , Wall Street 's self-regulator known as FINRA . 
She has worked for the non-governmental group since 1996 .

"Friday , December 19 , 2008 ; 10:02 AM -- Text of President George W. Bush 's remarks delivered Friday at the White House on financial assistance to troubled auto makers : For years , America 's automakers have faced serious challenges ; burdensome costs , shrinking share of the market and declining profits . 
In recent months , the global financial crisis has made these challenges even more severe . 
Now , some U.S. auto executives say that their companies are nearing collapse and that the only way they can buy time to restructure is with help from the federal government . 
It 's a difficult situation that involves fundamental questions about the proper role of government . 
On the one hand , government has the responsibility not to undermine the private enterprise system . 
On the other hand , government has a responsibility to safeguard the broader health and stability of our economy . 
Addressing the challenges in the auto industry requires us to balance these two responsibilities . 
If we were to allow the free market to take its course now , it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers . 
Under ordinary economic circumstances , I would say this is the price that failed companies must pay . 
And I would not favor intervening to prevent the automakers from going out of business . 
But these are not ordinary circumstances . 
In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession , allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action . 
The question is how we can best give it a chance to succeed . 
Some argue the wisest path is to allow the auto companies to reorganize through Chapter 11 provisions of our bankruptcy laws and provide federal loans to keep them operating while they try to restructure under the supervision of a bankruptcy court . 
But given the current state of the auto industry and the economy , Chapter 11 is unlikely to work for American automakers at this time . 
American consumers understand why . 
If you hear that a car company is suddenly going into bankruptcy , you worry that parts and servicing will not be available and you question the value of your warranty . 
With consumers hesitant to buy new cars from struggling automakers , it would be more difficult for auto companies to recover . 
Additionally , the financial crisis brought the auto companies to the brink of bankruptcy much faster than they could have anticipated . 
And they have not made the legal and financial preparations necessary to carry out an orderly bankruptcy proceeding that could lead to a successful restructuring . 
The convergence of these factors means there is too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly liquidation of American auto companies . 
My economic advisers believe that such a collapse would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworking Americans far beyond the auto industry . 
It would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis . 
It could send our suffering economy into a deeper and longer recession .

Obama Takes First Shot at Reshaping Fed by Naming Board Member Obama will name Daniel Tarullo , at podium , to the Fed 's Board of Governors , Mary Schapiro to head the Securities and Exchange Commission and Gary Gensler to chair the Commodities Futures Trading Commission . 
-LRB- By Gerald Herbert -- Associated Press -RRB- With vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board and the terms of Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , left , and Vice Chairman Donald L. Kohn , center , expiring in 2010 , President-elect Barack Obama has the opportunity to remake the central bank early in his administration . 
He said yesterday that overhauling financial regulation is one of his priorities . 
-LRB- By Brendan Smialowski -- Bloomberg News -RRB- President-elect Barack Obama has an unusual opportunity to remake the Federal Reserve in the early part of his presidency , shaping the institution at a time that it is undergoing dramatic change . 
Obama said yesterday that he will name Daniel K. Tarullo , a law professor and banking regulation expert , to the Fed 's Board of Governors . 
Because of current expired terms , Obama can appoint two more governors , subject to confirmation by the Senate . 
Then in January 2010 , Obama can either reappoint or replace Chairman Ben S. Bernanke when his term expires and make the same decision about Vice Chairman Donald L. Kohn when his term ends in June of that year . 
Fed governors serve a 14-year term , though in practice most leave after a few years . 
Thus within 18 months of taking office , Obama will likely have appointed five of the seven Fed governors . 
The central bank is designed to be independent from politics , so a president 's best chance of influencing how the Fed will regulate banks or respond to economic changes is through these appointments . 
Tarullo , a Georgetown University law professor and top aide to former President Bill Clinton on international economic matters , has been generally skeptical of key parts of the Basel II international standards for bank regulation , arguing that the approach needs to be changed in major ways to prevent financial crisis like the one underway . 
As a Fed governor , Tarullo would have a place at the table to reshape international bank regulations according to that philosophy . 
At a news conference yesterday , Obama also named Mary L. Schapiro , a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission , to chair that body , and Gary Gensler , a Treasury undersecretary in the Clinton administration , to chair the Commodities Futures Trading Commission . 
Obama , in announcing the picks , said that the overhaul of financial regulation will be `` one of the top legislative priorities '' of his administration . 
`` We have been asleep at the switch , '' he said , referring to the SEC , other financial regulators and Congress . 
He declined to offer details of the overhaul . 
The Obama administration will come to power at a time when the Fed is taking on vast new responsibilities . 
Just this week , the central bank signaled that it will take more unconventional steps to stimulate lending . 
Now the primary regulator of almost every major financial firm , the Fed also could be given new powers to oversee any company that is big enough to pose a systemic risk to the financial system . 
`` The Fed needs to be thinking about both the overall strategy of regulation , and what role the Fed itself should play in implementing that strategy , '' said Marvin Goodfriend , an economist at Carnegie Mellon University . 
The Fed 's structure is designed to insulate its leaders from politics . 
The president has no direct authority over governors once they take office . 
Obama has told Bernanke that he will maintain the recent tradition of respecting the Fed 's independence and not trying to arm-twist the bank on its interest rate policies . 
But in choosing whom to appoint to the Fed 's board of governors , and especially to the chairmanship , a president has considerable power to shape the approach the central bank will take to major policy decisions . 
The most frequent lines of disagreement among Fed officials in the past have been over whether , at any given time , inflation or growth is the greatest risk . 
Obama could choose nominees whose theories about the risks facing the economy match his own . 
For example , President Clinton named Fed governors who were open to the premise that technological innovation in the 1990s enabled the economy to grow faster than it had in the past without sparking inflation . 
That gave then-chairman Alan Greenspan latitude to allow strong growth to continue instead of trying to choke it off with rate increases . 
At the moment , the biggest concerns are how the Fed should respond to the financial crisis and , eventually , whether and how to remove some of the unprecedented lending programs it has launched . 
`` The Fed 's immediate challenge is to stop the hemorrhaging of the economy and stabilize the patient , '' said Peter Hooper , a former Fed official who is now the chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities . 
`` Next , it will face a huge challenge in picking up the timing of exiting from this very aggressive foray into unconventional policies . '' 
If it moves too fast in eliminating the programs , the Fed could stoke a return and deepening of the financial crisis . 
If it does n't draw them down quickly enough , it could stoke inflation . 
The biggest Fed-related decision Obama must make in his first year as president is whom to appoint chairman when Bernanke 's term ends in January 2010 . 
Bernanke has won praise from Democrats in Congress for being pragmatic , responding aggressively and creatively to the financial crisis , and working to build consensus . 
But there are strikes against him . 
In his first 18 months as chairman , he did not see the crisis looming and then had a relatively reserved response in its initial months . 
Moreover , it may be politically difficult to reappoint a Fed chairman if the economy is still in the dumps . 
Fed watchers say former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers would be a leading contender to replace Bernanke if Obama seeks a new chairman . 
Summers , who will be working closely with the president as director of the White House National Economic Council , is an accomplished academic economist with financial market experience . 
In a series of newspaper articles during the first months of the financial crisis , he advocated a government response that was more activist than that embraced by Bernanke at the time . 
But Summers 's often combative style might not sit well at the Fed , where decisions are traditionally made by consensus . 
According to Fed observers , other candidates for chairman could include Janet Yellen , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a former official in the Clinton administration ; Timothy F. Geithner , the New York Fed president whom Obama plans to nominate as Treasury secretary ; and Christina Romer , a highly regarded economist who is to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .

"Views Diverge on How To Recast Fannie , Freddie Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's `` public-private entanglement '' will likely be undone . 
-LRB- By Susan Walsh -- Associated Press -RRB- Policymakers are looking to revamp the nation 's home loan system next year after the collapse of U.S. housing and mortgage markets spurred the current economic crisis . 
Under one possible approach , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the federally run companies that control half of the nation 's $ 11 trillion mortgage market , would disappear , leaving lending primarily to private banks . 
Taxpayers would no longer be on the line for subsidizing home loans . 
But analysts say it could become much harder to get a mortgage -- at least one with a relatively low interest rate and a 30-year term . 
Under another approach , Fannie and Freddie would remain . 
They could continue as private companies , trying to strike the difficult balance between the demands of profit-seeking shareholders and those of policy-oriented lawmakers . 
They could also be turned into government agencies . 
In either of these cases , taxpayers would remain potentially exposed to trillions of dollars in losses . 
The debate comes after the nation endured a bruising effort to promote homeownership in the past decade . 
Fannie and Freddie provided hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to people with blemished credit records or other financial limitations , which led to huge losses and the government seizing the firms in September as the financial crisis escalated . 
The government agreed to cover as much as $ 200 billion in losses . 
Now policymakers are looking at ways to prevent a relapse while maintaining Fannie and Freddie 's charge of supplying consistent funding for mortgages . 
Fannie , Freddie and government agencies are funding nearly all of the nation 's home loans ; private lenders have all but disappeared . 
`` If we want to divorce the federal government from the risks of the housing system , you would privatize it , '' said Howard Glaser , a housing consultant who has worked for Fannie and Freddie . 
`` The cost of that is you never know if you 'll have mortgage finance available . 
Case in point : today . '' 
Fannie and Freddie were chartered by Congress 40 years ago as private companies with a government mandate to buy mortgages from lenders , package them , guarantee them against default and sell them to investors around the world . 
As a result , borrowers in big cities or small towns could go to big banks or small thrifts and get a 30-year , fixed-rate loan at an affordable rate . 
But risks always loomed . 
Investors assumed that the government backed Fannie and Freddie , even if they did not have such support officially . 
As a result , the companies could borrow cheaply and grow big -- with as much outstanding debt as the U.S. government . 
But the housing crisis crippled the companies , prompting the Bush administration to take them over out of concern they 'd severely damage the world financial system . 
Some longtime supporters of Fannie and Freddie say they must change , but still see a need for the government to play a role . 
`` The Fannie and Freddie model has to be approached and the private-public entanglement , I think , will be undone , '' Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said in a recent interview . 
Frank said the reform of Fannie and Freddie is likely to include `` some subsidy for enhanced affordability and increasing the flow of mortgages . '' 
But there is little agreement about precisely how to restructure them . 
While Frank no longer thinks the hybrid model is viable , another influential lawmaker does . 
`` The hybrid is the best , '' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- , who leads the Joint Economic Committee . 
`` The hybrid nature should remain . '' 
President-elect Barack Obama has said little on the topic . 
Obama 's chief economic adviser , former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers , has long been a critic of the risks posed by Fannie and Freddie . 
In a Washington Post opinion piece this past summer , Summers wrote that the government should use Fannie and Freddie to support the housing market during the crisis and that the government should then `` divide their functions into government and private components , the latter of which would be sold off in multiple pieces . '' 
"
"Christopher Cox , the embattled chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , is defending his restrained approach to the financial crisis , saying he has provided steady leadership as Wall Street 's main regulator at a time when other federal regulators have responded precipitously to upheaval in the markets . 
During his tenure , the SEC has watched as all the investment banks it oversaw collapsed , were swallowed up or got out of their traditional line of business . 
The agency , meanwhile , was on the sidelines while the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve worked to bail out the financial sector . 
And the SEC , by its own admission , failed to detect an alleged $ 50 billion fraud by Bernard L. Madoff that may be the largest Ponzi scheme in history . 
But in his first interview since the Madoff scandal broke , Cox said he was not responsible for the agency 's failure to detect the alleged fraud and that he had responded properly to the broader financial crisis given the information he had . 
Confronted with a barrage of criticism from lawmakers , former officials and even some of his staff , Cox said he took pride in his measured response to the market turmoil . 
`` What we have done in this current turmoil is stay calm , which has been our greatest contribution -- not being impulsive , not changing the rules willy-nilly , but going through a very professional and orderly process that takes into account unintended consequences and gives ample notice to market participants , '' Cox said . 
This caution , he added , `` has really been a signal achievement for the SEC . '' 
Taking a swipe at the shifting response of the Treasury and Fed in addressing the financial crisis , he said : `` When these gale-force winds hit our markets , there were panicked cries to change any and every rule of the marketplace : ` Let 's try this . 
Let 's try that . ' 
What was needed was a steady hand . '' 
Cox said the biggest mistake of his tenure was agreeing in September to an extraordinary three-week ban on short selling of financial company stocks . 
But in publicly acknowledging for the first time that this ban was not productive , Cox said he had been under intense pressure from Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to take this action and did so reluctantly . 
They `` were of the view that if we did not act and act at that instant , these financial institutions could fail as a result and there would be nothing left to save , '' Cox said . 
Although Cox speaks of staying calm in the face of financial turmoil , lawmakers across the political spectrum counter that this is actually another way of saying that his agency remained passive during the worst global financial crisis in decades . 
And they say that Cox 's stewardship before this year -- focusing on deregulation as the agency 's staff shrank -- laid the groundwork for the meltdown . 
`` The commission in recent years has handcuffed the inspection and enforcement division , '' said Arthur Levitt , SEC chairman during the Clinton administration . 
`` The environment was not conducive to proactive enforcement activity . '' 
Cox , 56 , a former Republican congressman from California , became chairman in mid-2005 and plans to step down early next year before his full five-year term expires . 
President-elect Barack Obama has nominated Mary L. Schapiro , a former SEC commissioner , to replace him . 
In a 90-minute conversation in his 10th-floor corner office last week , Cox said the SEC 's emphasis on enforcement is as strong as ever . 
`` We 've done everything we can during the last several years in the agency to make sure that people understand there 's a strong market cop on the beat , '' he said . 
`` That 's why Madoff is such a big asterisk , '' he added . 
`` The case is very troubling for that reason . 
It 's what the SEC 's good at . 
And it 's inexplicable . '' 
Cox argued that the agency has carefully defined responsibilities and that it was unfair to blame it for every problem on Wall Street .

"When New York Gov. Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered a commencement address at Oglethorpe University in May 1932 , the economic crisis that had befallen the United States three years earlier had already morphed into the Great Depression : One in four Americans was out of work , banks were failing at a rate of 10 per week and the gross national product was at half its pre-crash level . 
FDR called on the federal government to `` correct , by drastic means if necessary , the faults in our economic system . '' 
The times called for `` bold , persistent experimentation , '' he declared . 
Strictly by the numbers , today 's economic crisis is , fortunately , not as severe as the Great Depression was . 
But that 's cold comfort to the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs , homes , health care and retirement savings . 
We are living through the toughest times since the 1930s . 
People reasonably expect government to act boldly . 
I 've spoken at length about the current economic crisis with other governors , including Deval Patrick -LRB- Mass. -RRB- , David Paterson -LRB- N.Y. -RRB- , Jim Doyle -LRB- Wis. -RRB- , Jennifer Granholm -LRB- Mich. -RRB- and Ted Strickland -LRB- Ohio -RRB- . 
We agree that our states -- however diverse they may be -- have similar needs and problems that should be addressed by the economic recovery package being developed in Washington . 
That can best be achieved if Congress and the new administration keep in mind the following principles : First , the states , local governments and the federal government must be full partners in the recovery process . 
Working with counties and municipalities , states have mechanisms in place to pump stimulus funds into the economy quickly and responsibly . 
But we do n't have the federal government 's financial capacity or borrowing authority . 
Any recovery effort should reflect our mutual strengths . 
Second , the package should be large . 
Some estimates put the cost of the economic crisis next year at $ 700 billion , or about 4 percent of gross domestic product . 
To offset this , the cumulative value of the stimulus plan should be $ 1 trillion over two years . 
This is a large sum , but if the spending is executed effectively , it should be a significant investment in our country 's physical and human resources that will pay long-term dividends while also creating and saving jobs . 
The stimulus should be roughly divided into five categories : infrastructure , countercyclical programs , housing , education block grants and middle-class tax cuts . 
For every billion dollars we spend on infrastructure , we can put upwards of 20,000 people back to work . 
On one hand , we 've learned painful lessons about the need to modernize our bridges and levees . 
On the other hand , we must think broadly about the idea of infrastructure : How many hours do people waste circling airports because our air-traffic control systems are outdated ? 
We must commit to improving our transportation system , energy grid , Internet technology , ports , public housing and school facilities . 
Unless we also help states shore up their safety-net social programs , the economic impact of the federal stimulus will be negated . 
Most states are constitutionally required to balance their budgets . 
Given the sharp decline in state revenue , we are not able to support , let alone increase , spending to meet growing demands for basic needs such as unemployment insurance , food assistance programs and health care -- including mental-health services to those with developmental disabilities . 
Most states are facing cuts to these essential services , reductions that will exact an enormous toll on our most vulnerable citizens and remove money and jobs from the economy just when we need to promote growth . 
Put another way , even if the federal government dedicates a large sum to infrastructure , cutbacks in state and local safety-net programs would cancel out much of the effect of the stimulus . 
Over two years , the federal government should boost its countercyclical spending by at least $ 250 billion . 
It can do so by increasing the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages ; the federal share of Medicaid costs ; and other health-care-related programs such as reimbursement to hospitals for treating the uninsured , Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and child-care grants . 
Many state unemployment trust funds are already depleted . 
Rising unemployment rates and reduced revenue over the next few months are likely to trigger major payroll tax increases in 2009 . 
This harm could be partly mitigated by doubling proposed federal funding for state unemployment trust funds under the Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act , which would provide incentives to cover vulnerable low-wage and part-time workers who are often denied benefits . 
Unless we strike at the cause of the meltdown -- the collapse of the housing market -- our economy will continue spiraling downward . 
The federal recovery package should include funding for state housing mortgage authorities and for programs that help people restructure their mortgages , stay in their homes and find new shelter if evicted . 
If we are to pursue relief and recovery , it 's essential that we continue developing a workforce that is able to meet the demands of the 21st-century economy . 
At least $ 250 billion in preschool-through-college education block grants would help states meet their school budget obligations ; more important , such grants would enable greater strides toward universal early childhood education and fully funded programs for special-needs students -- improving the situation today and laying the foundation for a better tomorrow . 
A sizable middle-class tax cut is key . 
Over the past decade , median family income has failed to keep pace with inflation , especially given the sharply rising costs of health care and education . 
Most Americans have lost ground . 
Relief for the middle class would help our families weather the storm and also boost economic demand . 
In 1932 , Roosevelt warned against being of `` faint heart , fearful of change , sitting tightly on the rooftops in the flood . '' 
His words are still prescient today . 
We must be bold -- $ 1 trillion bold . 
America has abundant resources and a generous , ambitious spirit . 
If we work together , we 'll emerge stronger and more prosperous than ever .

"The Economy 's Latest Hurdle for Retailers : Shoplifting The Mall in Columbia upgraded its video surveillance system a few years ago . 
There are more than 100 cameras in the mall that can zoom in almost enough to make out a price tag . 
-LRB- The Mall In Columbia -RRB- Retailers have blamed the global financial crisis for a litany of ills over the past year : slumping sales , mass layoffs and bankruptcy filings . 
Now , they are looking to the economy to explain recent spikes in shoplifting from their stores . 
Though individual retailers do not publicly report crime data , a survey of 52 national chain stores released this month by the Retail Industry Leaders Association -LRB- RILA -RRB- , a trade group , showed that 84 percent reported an increase in shoplifting since the recession began . 
About 80 percent said organized retail crime had also jumped , and more than half said robberies and burglaries have risen , as well . 
`` Bad guys are smart . 
People do not give them credit , '' said Brad Brekke , vice president of assets protection at Target . 
`` They understand odds are either for or against them , and if they see the odds swing in their favor , they will take advantage of it . '' 
In the Washington area , Alexandria police said there have been more shoplifting reports nearly every month this year compared with last year , though they expect December to slacken . 
In Tysons Corner , Lt. Josh Laitinen said his officers arrested 40 people over the past three weeks on shoplifting charges . 
And in Montgomery County , Detective David Hill , who oversees the county 's retail crime division , said many stores have told him that crime is up . 
`` I 'm sure it 's a major concern for all of them , '' Hill said . 
`` No one wants to just give anything away . '' 
Retail crime typically increases during the holiday season as customers flood stores staffed with temporary -- and often untested -- employees . 
Doorbuster holiday discounts and aggressive merchandising , such as stocking more products near entryways , also provide ne'er - do-wells with more opportunities . 
But retailers and law enforcement officials say the economic downturn is resulting in more frequent and more aggressive crimes . 
Fighting these trends is an expensive proposition for retailers . 
According to the Center for Retail Research , a British organization that did a global survey , U.S. stores spent about $ 12 billion last year to combat retail crime . 
Many employ security officers to monitor surveillance cameras throughout the store . 
Some companies are testing new technology that can detect when a shelf is cleared of merchandise and then alert employees , according to Lee Pernice , director of retail marketing for security firm ADT . 
Target is looking at so-called `` benefit denial '' technology that requires popular products to be activated at checkout in order to work , Brekke said , similar to the process used for gift cards . 
It also has begun using spiderwrap -- cables with a built-in sensor -- on hot items . 
But many retailers are relying on standards such as beefing up security during the holiday season and training employees to spot suspicious behavior . 
Pernice said companies face a tough choice as they watch sales and revenue slump : Does it cost more to be a victim of crime or to fight it ? 
Retailers lost an average of nearly $ 35 billion , or about 1.4 percent of their inventory , to theft last year , according to an annual survey conducted by the University of Florida . 
During the most recent recession in 2001 , so-called shrinkage rates averaged 1.8 percent . 
Results for this year will not be available until 2009 . 
Economic downturns can lead to increased retail crime as law enforcement organizations cut costs and personnel . 
Retailers face declining sales , and some are choosing to reduce security staff , according to retail and loss prevention experts . 
Hundreds of stores across the country are being shut down , and several retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection , scenarios that tend to lure more crooks . 
The financial crisis has drained many consumers ' wallets as layoffs mount and 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s continue their freefall . 
That has contributed to an increase in so-called `` opportunistic '' theft from shoppers stealing for personal use or consumption . 
The items stolen can span a cost range , from drugstore cosmetics to pricey electronics . 
Hill said many of the retail thefts he has seen over the past year were committed by first-time offenders . 
`` Some people are being forced to make bad decisions , '' said Joe LaRocca , vice president of loss prevention for the National Retail Federation , a trade group . 
`` There is no right reason to steal from retailers . '' 
More troubling to the industry is the growth in organized retail crime , sophisticated operations that target popular items such as baby formula or diabetic strips for resale . 
According to the RILA survey , 89 percent of grocery and drug stores said such crimes had risen in recent months , the most of any category of retailer . 
Paul Jones , vice president of asset protection for RILA , said the increased demand for low-priced goods during these turbulent economic times is providing retail crime gangs with a larger market for stolen items . 
They typically sell their products through online auction sites for less than market price , a process known as e-fencing . 
Consumers often do not know -- and sometimes do not care -- about the origin of those goods . 
Jones said several organized retail crimes have been tied to gangs and even the mob . 
Earlier this year , a high-ranking member of a crime family in New Jersey was accused of using fake bar codes to buy merchandise at Lowe 's for pennies and then reselling it . 
`` People think it 's a victimless crime , that you 're stealing from a corporation , '' Pernice said . 
But `` it translates into higher prices for you and me and every other American out there . ''

"World leaders have vowed to help prevent future financial meltdowns by creating international accounting standards so all companies would play by the same rules , but the effort has instead been mired in loopholes and political pressures . 
In October , largely hidden from public view , the International Accounting Standards Board changed the rules so European banks could make their balance sheets look better . 
The action let the banks rewrite history , picking and choosing among their problem investments to essentially claim that some had been on a different set of books before the financial crisis started . 
The results were dramatic . 
Deutsche Bank shifted $ 32 billion of troubled assets , turning a $ 970 million quarterly pretax loss into $ 120 million profit . 
And the securities markets were fooled , bidding Deutsche Bank 's shares up nearly 19 percent on Oct. 30 , the day it made the startling announcement that it had turned an unexpected profit . 
The change has had dramatic consequences within the cloistered world of accounting , shattering the credibility of the IASB -- the very body whose rules have been adopted by 113 countries and is supposed to become the global standard-setter , including for the United States , within a few years . 
Sir David Tweedie , chairman of the IASB , acknowledged that the body needs more protection from political manipulation before it can claim that it has become the global gold standard . 
Tweedie said he nearly resigned over the rule change demanded by European politicians . 
`` I was so frustrated by the whole thing , '' he said . 
`` All the time when we are trying to build a global accounting system , and we are pretty close to it , and then suddenly out of left field this thing appears . 
It 's just absolutely exasperating . '' 
U.S. standards have been set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board since 1973 . 
`` Right now , there is no credibility , '' said Robert Denham , chairman of the Financial Accounting Foundation , which oversees the FASB . 
`` If we are going to have global accounting standards , my view is that is not going to work if the IASB is going to be jerked around by the European Commission . 
That is the very real risk that is posed by the EC coercion and the IASB 's response . '' 
The episode exposes how small , incremental changes in arcane accounting rules can affect billions of dollars in market value and corporate profitability . 
In turn , the money at risk raises the political stakes , as desperate companies begin to lobby political leaders to insist on changes that normally would come about only after a careful discussion and evaluation by experts . 
For years , there has been a disconnect between U.S. and international accounting rules . 
With the history of corporate litigation in the United States , U.S. standards tend to be exact and explicit , making it easier for companies to defend themselves in court . 
International rules rely on broad principles , giving companies greater leeway to make their own judgments . 
An extensive review of international accounting standards published last month by Moody 's Investors Service found significant differences between two French companies on one key issue -- even though they used the same accounting firm . 
Nevertheless , more than 110 countries have already adopted international rules since the IASB was established in 2001 , with Japan , South Korea , India and Canada soon to make the switch . 
Tweedie expects that 150 countries will have adopted IASB rules within the next three years . 
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Nov. 14 adopted a plan to have all U.S. companies prepare their statements using international standards for fiscal years ending after Dec. 15 , 2016 . 
More than 100 of the largest companies would be permitted to adopt the rules as soon as next year . 
But the financial crisis demonstrated how vulnerable the fledgling system is to political pressure . 
On Oct. 8 , the leaders of France , Germany , Italy , Britain and the European Commission met in Paris to discuss the worldwide economic crisis . 
They issued a statement saying they were working together `` within the European Union and with our international partners '' to ensure the safety and stability of the worldwide banking system . 
But buried within the statement was a sentence warning that European banks should not face a competitive disadvantage with U.S. banks `` in terms of accounting rules and their interpretation . '' 
The leaders added ominously : `` This issue must be resolved by the end of the month . '' 
At issue is an accounting standard known as fair value , or mark to market , in which companies disclose how much an asset could fetch on the open market . 
With the values of assets plummeting , banks were suddenly stuck with paper losses on assets they could no longer sell . 
With some critics saying the provision was forcing banks to take large write-downs , the SEC and FASB issued guidance in late September that companies could use their own internal models for assigning a value to assets -- in essence , a nod to the principles-based international rules . 
But European officials smelled a rat . 
Under rare circumstances , U.S. companies are permitted to reclassify assets they were actively seeking to trade into long-term `` loans , '' using an accounting rule that was considered weaker than the international equivalent . 
The international rules did not permit such transfers , and European officials feared that the new guidance was handing the Americans a competitive advantage . 
Shortly after the European leaders ' statement , Commissioner Charlie McCreevy of the European Commission , who was in charge of the European Union internal market , signaled he would introduce legal changes , overriding the international rules . 
McCreevy decided to exploit a loophole in the system -- that all accounting rules must be adopted as legislation by the E.U. . 
So McCreevy was going to force the changes on the IASB by threatening to remove -- or carve out -- the existing regulation , leaving nothing in its place . 
`` We made it clear what the IASB should accept , '' said Oliver Drewes , a spokesman for McCreevy . 
`` There is always the right , and threat and the pressure , that one could go for a carve-out for European companies . '' 
Tweedie said the rulemaking body had only four days to act before McCreevy pushed through a change in the law , even though accounting changes of this magnitude would normally take months to achieve . 
Unlike the U.S. board , the international board has no regulator like the SEC to help shield it from political pressure . 
So the IASB was at the mercy of the European Commission . 
`` There had been pressure on him , I suspect , from some of the European leaders , '' Tweedie said , referring to McCreevy . 
`` It was quite clear it was going to be pushed through and that would have been a disaster . 
We were faced with this hole being blown in the European accounting , and we just wanted to step in and control it . '' 
But the IASB bowed to demands to let the firms backdate the accounting shift to the beginning of July -- something not permitted under U.S. rules . 
In a recent report , Moody 's wrote that the backdating provision could distort a bank 's earnings and capital position , since `` it allows managements to ` cherry-pick ' selected assets '' and `` distort their economic reality , '' making it more -- not less -- difficult to compare global bank performance . 
`` The measure does not make much sense in the first place , '' said J.F. Tremblay , a Moody 's vice president . 
`` But the fact that a board can be influenced like that is not good news . ''

"In recent weeks , my family and I have carefully observed the bailouts that have been provided to , or requested by , various companies since the financial crisis began . 
After much deliberation with our accountants and financial advisers , we have concluded that , in order to prevent a deeper recession and turn around the U.S. economy , the federal government needs to give the next bailout package directly to us . 
The U.S. government is currently considering a variety of economic rescue strategies , including some that would ultimately cost as much as $ 1.2 trillion , or approximately $ 4,000 for every man , woman and child in the United States . 
Accordingly , for a family of 10 such as ours -LRB- three sons , three grandchildren and two daughters-in-law -RRB- , this means a $ 40,000 bailout . 
To reduce administrative costs , instead of writing 10 separate checks , the Treasury can send it all to me . 
As head of the household , I can be trusted to make sure every member of our family gets his or her fair share . 
Officials and taxpayers alike can rest assured that my family members will monitor me much more directly than any government oversight committee would ever monitor J.P. Morgan Chase , Citibank , Bank of America and the other big winners of the recent bailout lottery . 
We deserve these funds for the same reasons that the big Wall Street firms and the giant automakers do . 
First , we do not believe in government handouts . 
-LRB- Evidently , this is the first requirement for any entity that intends to receive a government handout . -RRB- 
Like the previous recipients of bailout funds , we have made a living in the marketplace and never received federal money . 
In fact , we have argued for years that government should not meddle in the economy but should leave us alone . 
So , now that the economy is in crisis , we therefore deserve to be first in line . 
Second , money for our family will have a positive ripple effect throughout the economy . 
If we received a generous bailout package , we would certainly purchase a new and more fuel-efficient car . 
We would also commit to spending the entire amount on other much-needed consumer and service items that will sustain many other businesses . 
For example , we would act on our plans to remodel our backyard patio . 
Dollar for dollar , the economic stimulus provided to our family would have far-reaching effects . 
Third , offering our family a generous financial package would restore confidence in the economy . 
We have lived in our community for many years and have a large and influential circle of friends and professional colleagues . 
We recently asked many of these upstanding people how they would respond if our family declared bankruptcy . 
Without exception , our personal friends and business associates stated that they would be very upset . 
Conversely , if we received a bailout , they affirmed that their faith in the economy would be strengthened , and that they , too , would seek bailout money to maintain their current levels of spending . 
Fourth , supporting our family would please a significant number of Democrats and Republicans . 
We have friends in both parties and have contributed to candidates on both sides of the aisle . 
So an early and generous response to our financial hardship would trigger bipartisan support . 
In closing , I want to stress that our family would expect to be held accountable for every dollar . 
Once we receive a U.S. Treasury check , we promise to spend it quickly and efficiently in 2009 and will account for those expenditures on our 2010 tax forms . 
We firmly believe that an upturn in the economy will follow within 12 to 18 months . 
Note to the Obama administration : If the economy does n't respond , it does not mean that the decision to bail out our family was wrong . 
It simply means the amount was too small . 
But we patriotically pledge not to request additional financial support until 2010 .

"For Bailout Money , GMAC Agrees to End Deal With GM The auto financing giant GMAC relinquished its exclusive right to provide financing to people buying General Motors vehicles in exchange for up to $ 6 billion in federal aid . 
The deal abruptly ends a 10-year contract between GM and GMAC , according to the lender 's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday . 
In the past , whenever GM offered vehicle financing and leasing specials , such as below-market interest rates , it did so through GMAC . 
The lender paid an annual fee to GM for the exclusivity and was required to meet sales targets . 
Now , over the next two years , the automaker can offer incentive programs through other lenders under certain requirements , the filing said . 
After that period , the terms will gradually loosen until 2013 , when GM will have the right to offer programs through any lender -- including GMAC -- without any restrictions or limitations . 
The agreement also releases GMAC from meeting specific sales targets and the obligation to provide leases . 
`` I do n't see anything negative in this new arrangement , as long as GMAC is still supportive of GM 's effort to sell cars , '' said Jack Fitzgerald , owner of Bethesda-based Fitzgerald Auto Malls . 
The changes , effective Monday , follow the Federal Reserve 's approval of GMAC to become a bank holding company , making the lender eligible for a slice of the Treasury Department 's $ 700 billion financial rescue package . 
Chrysler Financial , that automaker 's credit arm , also has applied for aid under the Troubled Asset Relief Program . 
Yesterday , Chrysler said it received a $ 4 billion loan from the Treasury through the auto rescue package signed into law by President Bush two weeks ago . 
Under the GMAC deal , the government received 5 million preferred shares in GMAC that pay an 8 percent dividend -- a larger payout to taxpayers than the 5 percent dividend on its investments in banks -- in return for a $ 5 billion capital injection in the company . 
Treasury said it would also lend up to $ 1 billion to GM so that the automaker would invest in the firm and support its reorganization . 
The financial crisis has hit GMAC hard , and losses have mounted in both its mortgage and auto loan businesses . 
Overall , GMAC lost $ 5.59 billion in the past three quarters . 
Unable to find other funding sources and running low on cash , the finance arm shrunk its ability to make loans . 
GM 's auto sales have suffered as a result . 
Bank holding status gives GMAC a chance at survival by providing it with access to new sources of funding . 
But , as a bank holding company , this wholly owned division will also need to change . 
The Fed has required GM and Cerberus Capital Management , which own the lender , to divest a significant chunk of their ownership because commercial companies are not allowed to own banks . 
This week , the company showed signs of healing . 
On Tuesday , GMAC said it would make car purchases easier by offering financing to customers with credit scores above 620 . 
On Wednesday , it completed a complicated debt deal to raise cash needed to help it survive this historic auto sales slump . 
But it fell short of its goal . 
The same day , GM received an initial $ 4 billion of its $ 13.4 billion bailout from the government . 
Despite this recovery , Fitzgerald said he worried that , as a bank holding company , GMAC might stray too far from its roots . 
Captive financing companies like GMAC are critical to marketing vehicles in large volumes , he said . 
`` GM has had all the benefits that Ford Motor Credit provides to the Ford Motor Company , '' he said . 
`` If GMAC does all that , fine . 
If it does n't , GM will have to create another GMAC of its own . 
It 's just the way it is . ''

"Let me begin with the caveats : I like men . 
My husband is one , as are my two sons . 
I have spent most of my career surrounded by men , and I have no major complaints . 
But as the financial debacle unfolds , I ca n't help noticing that all the perpetrators of the greatest economic mess in eight decades are , well , men . 
Specifically , they are rich , white , middle-aged guys , same as the ones who brought us Watergate in the 1970s , the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s and , presumably , the fall of Rome . 
One might argue , of course , that the preponderance of men behaving badly on Wall Street is just a mathematical corollary of the preponderance of men doing anything on Wall Street . 
But the truth is more complicated . 
Although the Y-chromosome is undeniably overrepresented along all tiers of finance , it is particularly overrepresented at the highest levels of power and in those sectors most deeply implicated in the current crisis . 
A Catalyst Research study last year found that women make up almost 60 percent of the workforce at Fortune 500 finance and insurance companies but account for only 17.9 percent of corporate officer positions and none of the chief executive positions . 
In the world of hedge funds , women are notable largely for their absence . 
Clearly , some greater force is at work here , something more than the traditional clubbiness of Wall Street or the obstacles that still confront women juggling work and family . 
It may be that women perceive and act on risk in subtly different ways ; that they do n't , as a general rule , embrace the kind of massively aggressive behavior that brought us a Dow of 14,000 and then , seemingly overnight , a crash of epic proportions . 
Whether it be from a protectiveness born of biology or a reticence imposed by social norms , women may be less inclined than men to place the kind of bets that can get them in real trouble . 
Conversely , women may also be more inclined to blow the whistle on others ' risky business . 
Consider the case of Brooksley Born , former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , who in 1997 called for greater disclosure and new rules to govern the exploding world of financial derivatives . 
She was chastised by some of the most powerful men on Wall Street , and her recommendations were ignored . 
But she was right . 
So was Sherron Watkins , the first Enron executive to warn its CEO that the company was heading for deep financial trouble . 
So was Coleen Rowley , the FBI agent who prodded her superiors -- unsuccessfully -- to investigate the men who later unleashed the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 . 
We do n't yet know why women respond differently to danger signals -- and earlier , it appears -- than men . 
We do n't know why women either shy away , or are effectively banned , from businesses that thrive on risk . 
One possibility , explored in a fascinating study published last year by John Coates and Joe Herbert of Cambridge University , is that women simply do n't have the testosterone for it ; on the trading floor , they deduced , higher profits literally correlate with higher levels of the male hormone . 
Another , examined in laboratory experiments conducted by Muriel Niederle and Lise Vesterlund at the University of Pittsburgh , is that women are far less inclined than men to bet their pay on performance , even if they have evidence to suggest that they are superior performers . 
Whatever the reason , the experience of the past year suggests that we desperately need to bring more women into leadership positions on Wall Street , in politics , in regulatory bodies and in American life generally . 
For decades , corporations and financial firms have sponsored expensive training programs to promote more women into their ranks . 
They have launched much-needed maternity policies and flexible work arrangements . 
Most of these initiatives , however , have been pursued to make life easier for the women involved -- or , more cynically , to remove the threat of lawsuit or adverse publicity for the firms . 
The financial crisis has exposed a quieter but equally pressing concern : We need women in leadership positions not only because they can manage as well as men but because they manage differently than men ; because they tend -- over time and in the aggregate -- to make different kinds of decisions and to accept and avoid different kinds of risk . 
We need women who will say no to bad decisions based on male-dominated rivalries and clubby golf course confidences . 
We need women to blow the whistle when risks explode and to challenge the presumptions that too many men , clustered too closely together and sharing a common worldview , can easily indulge . 
As the constant wail from Wall Street should remind us , diversity is n't just nice in theory . 
It makes for better business .

In its battle against the financial crisis , the U.S. government has extended its full faith and credit to an ever-growing swath of the private sector : first homeowners , then banks , now car companies . 
Soon , President-elect Barack Obama will put the government credit card to work with a massive fiscal boost for the economy . 
Necessary as these steps are , they raise a worry of their own : Can the United States pay the money back ? 
The notion seems absurd : Banana republics default , not the world 's biggest , richest economy , right ? 
The United States has unparalleled wealth , a stable legal tradition , responsible macroeconomic policies and a top-notch , triple-A credit rating . 
U.S. Treasury bonds are routinely called `` risk-free , '' and the United States has the unique privilege of borrowing in the currency that other countries like to hold as foreign-exchange reserves . 
Yes , default is unlikely . 
But it is no longer unthinkable . 
Thanks to the advent of credit derivatives -- financial contracts that allow investors to speculate on or protect against default -- we can now observe how likely global markets think it is that Uncle Sam will renege on America 's mounting debts . 
Last week , markets pegged the probability of a U.S. default at 6 percent over the next 10 years , compared with just 1 percent a year ago . 
For technical reasons , this is not a precise reading of investors ' views . 
Nonetheless , the trend is real , and it is grounded in some pretty fundamental concerns . 
The most important is the coming surge in the federal debt . 
At the end of the last fiscal year , in September , the total public debt held by the American people -LRB- excluding debt issued to the Social Security Trust Fund or held by the Federal Reserve -RRB- stood at $ 5.8 trillion , or 41 percent of gross domestic product -- about what the debt-to-GDP ratio has averaged since 1956 . 
But the Congressional Budget Office projects deficits of $ 1.9 trillion over the next two years . 
Add almost $ 800 billion of stimulus spending , and U.S. debt soars to 60 percent of GDP by 2010 -- the highest level since the early 1950s , when the nation was working off its World War II and Korean War debts . 
The other major cause for concern is that the federal government has taken on massive `` contingent liabilities '' -- loans and guarantees that do n't become actual costs until the borrower defaults and the federal guarantee has to be honored . 
For example , Washington has purchased $ 45 billion of preferred stock of Citigroup but has also agreed to backstop up to about $ 240 billion of its losses . 
Bianco Research , a Chicago financial research firm , puts the total of such contingent liabilities -LRB- as of Dec. 29 -RRB- at more than $ 8 trillion . 
The U.S. government wo n't shell out anything close to that , of course ; it may not pay out any money and might even turn a profit . 
But the worse the economy gets , the more likely it is that some of those contingent liabilities will become actual liabilities . 
How unprecedented would default be ? 
The United States has never failed to repay a debt in its history . 
But it has twice altered the repayment terms , notes a study by Carmen M. Reinhart of the University of Maryland and Kenneth S. Rogoff of Harvard University . 
In 1790 , when the infant republic took over the states ' colonial-era debts , it deferred some interest for 10 years . 
A more pertinent case occurred during the Great Depression . 
In 1933 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 41 percent against gold . 
This helped end the vicious cycle of bank failures , deflation and default that had worsened the economic downturn , but it created another dilemma . 
Since the Civil War , borrowers in the United States , including the government , had routinely issued bonds that allowed the holder to demand repayment in gold or its dollar equivalent , based on the price of gold when the bond was issued . 
Devaluation would have dramatically raised , in dollar terms , the burden of repayment . 
So in 1933 , Congress repealed the gold clause , a decision the Supreme Court upheld in 1935 . 
Reinhart argues that these episodes show that there are many forms of default other than the outright failure to redeem a bond . 
She thinks it exceedingly unlikely that the United States would ever default on its Treasury debt but says that a default is more likely to happen on the `` periphery '' : A state government or a federally backed entity might renege . 
Reinhart notes that Washington has issued a lot of guarantees recently , such as the Treasury Department 's declaration that it `` effectively '' backs the debts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
Future governments could balk at honoring those guarantees . 
Now , one reason the United States should not have to default is that , in a pinch , it can print the money it needs to pay off its debt . 
In practice , it would not literally print dollar bills ; rather , the Federal Reserve would purchase its bonds . 
Still , the effect is the same : The Fed , by `` monetizing '' government debt , would create vast new supplies of dollars to chase the same goods and services and thus also create inflation . 
This money-printing option is not available to countries that issue debt payable in foreign currencies or to countries that have adopted the euro , which is controlled by the independent European Central Bank . 
All the same , a country may not always prefer inflation to default . 
Reinhart and Rogoff found numerous instances of countries defaulting on their domestic currency debts , such as Russia , which did so in 1998 . 
`` Why would a government refuse to pay its domestic public debt in full when it can simply inflate the problem away ? '' 
`` Sometimes , the government may view repudiation as the lesser evil . '' 
Default would certainly seem preferable to the social and economic unrest that hyperinflation has visited on Zimbabwe today or on Latin America in the 1980s . 
Of course , it would be ridiculous to put the United States in the same company as Russia , much less Zimbabwe . 
Nonetheless , even if Washington never defaults , it can still suffer if questions about its ability to repay its debts affect its creditworthiness and thus its cost of borrowing . 
Consider Japan , which spent the 1990s running up enormous budget deficits in an effort to kick-start economic growth . 
It failed , and gross government debt rose from 71 percent of GDP in 1990 to 115 percent in 1998 , when Moody 's Investors Service stripped Japan of its triple-A credit rating . 
Moody 's figured that Japan 's probability of default , while still low , had nonetheless risen -- even though that debt was owed almost entirely in yen . 
Japan 's rating continued to slide until 2002 , at which point its gross debt had reached 154 percent of GDP . 
Having its credit rating slashed was a stunning comedown for the world 's second-largest economy and largest creditor nation . 
Nonetheless , Japan 's borrowing costs were n't much affected , in part because almost all its debt was held by Japanese investors , who were not much inclined to sell it . 
The U.S. government might not have the same good fortune : More than half of its publicly held debt is owned by foreigners . 
-LRB- Of course , many of those foreigners are central banks with no attractive alternatives to the dollar . -RRB- 
One key lesson of Japan 's experience : It 's not just the level of debt that affects a country 's creditworthiness but the performance of the underlying economy . 
The size of the economy determines the resources the government can call on to repay its debts .

"President Bush has presided over the weakest eight-year span for the U.S. economy in decades , according to an analysis of key data , and economists across the ideological spectrum increasingly view his two terms as a time of little progress on the nation 's thorniest fiscal challenges . 
The number of jobs in the nation increased by about 2 percent during Bush 's tenure , the most tepid growth over any eight-year span since data collection began seven decades ago . 
Gross domestic product , a broad measure of economic output , grew at the slowest pace for a period of that length since the Truman administration . 
And Americans ' incomes grew more slowly than in any presidency since the 1960s , other than that of Bush 's father . 
Bush and his aides are quick to point out that they oversaw 52 straight months of job growth in the middle of this decade , and that the economy expanded at a steady clip from 2003 to 2007 . 
But economists , including some former advisers to Bush , say it increasingly looks as if the nation 's economic expansion was driven to a large degree by the interrelated booms in the housing market , consumer spending and financial markets . 
Those booms , which the Bush administration encouraged with the idea of an `` ownership society , '' have proved unsustainable . 
`` The expansion was a continuation of the way the U.S. has grown for too long , which was a consumer-led expansion that was heavily concentrated in housing , '' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin , a onetime Bush White House staffer and one of Sen. John McCain 's top economic advisers for his presidential campaign . 
`` There was very little of the kind of saving and export-led growth that would be more sustainable . '' 
`` For a group that claims it wants to be judged by history , there is no evidence on the economic policy front that that was the view , '' Holtz-Eakin said . 
`` It was all Band-Aids . '' 
From 2002 to 2006 , the housing boom generated about 600,000 to 800,000 jobs that otherwise would not have been created -- about 10 percent of total job growth in that span , according to the consulting firm IHS Global Insight . 
Such data , expert say , suggest the economy was not as fundamentally strong as it seemed . 
`` Some of the recovery , some of the expansion , was based on very shaky foundations , '' said Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at Global Insight . 
`` It 's sad to say , but we really went nowhere for almost ten years , after you extract the boost provided by the housing and mortgage boom , '' said Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody 's Economy.com , and an informal adviser to McCain 's campaign . 
`` It 's almost a lost economic decade . '' 
The president 's current aides say they are proud of their economic record . 
They note , for instance , that they attempted to rein in the growth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the housing finance companies whose vast expansion they see as a central cause of the financial crisis . 
Independent analysts generally view them only as contributors to the crisis . 
`` It does look like a great eight years , aside from the last quarter , unfortunately , '' Edward P. Lazear , chairman of Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers , said in a recent interview . 
`` In the long term , things look good . 
The reason things look good is this economy will rebound , and it will rebound strongly ... We expect things to turn around , and I would say early in President Obama 's administration . '' 
Even excluding the 2008 recession , however , Bush presided over a weak period for the U.S. economy . 
For example , for the first seven years of the Bush administration , gross domestic product grew at a paltry 2.1 percent annual rate . 
The administration also failed to gain traction on some of the fundamental economic and fiscal issues facing the nation -- including solidifying the finances of Medicare and Social Security , simplifying the tax code , or making health care more affordable . 
Resolution of those issues might have left the government more flexibility to respond to the current crisis by lowering the nation 's future budget deficits . 
"
"The past few years have been tough for democracy around the world , and most observers have jumped to the conclusion that the U.S. financial crisis will only make things worse . 
Those who believe free markets are essential to democracy fear that the discrediting of market capitalism will undermine free and open governance . 
Even those less enamored of capitalism are afraid that the global identification of democracy with markets is so strong that the crisis will weaken the standing of liberal politics . 
There are other reasons for concern . 
For one thing , the Great Depression was devastating to democratic progress . 
The period between the first and second world wars included what Samuel P. Huntington characterized as the first `` reverse wave of democratization , '' as many of the European democracies that emerged after World War I succumbed to economic hardship and the rise of fascism . 
Under harsh economic conditions , it is more difficult for a democratic government to deliver the prosperity that its politicians promise and its citizens seek . 
Long-established democracies with deeply rooted institutions and strongly liberal political cultures may be able to withstand even sharp drops in income and steep increases in unemployment , but newer and less consolidated democracies will find it much harder to avoid political breakdowns . 
Yet these concerns present only one side of the picture . 
In fact , on balance , the economic crisis could bring global gains for democracy , largely because of its impact on democracy 's competitors . 
In just the past few years there has been not only a stagnation of democratic progress but also , for the first time since the end of the Cold War , the emergence of nondemocratic political systems that can claim to offer attractive models . 
Some observers lump together these nondemocratic alternatives under the label `` authoritarian capitalism '' -LRB- though this is little more than a catchall category of countries that seem to be achieving economic success without providing political freedom -RRB- . 
It can not be denied that , until late last year , several such countries -- China , Russia , Venezuela , Iran -- were riding high . 
But the economic crisis has rapidly gone global and reached them as well . 
With oil prices a fraction of their highs from just a few months ago , the oil exporters have taken a severe hit . 
Even China 's remarkable economic growth is likely to be imperiled as the downturn prompts its export markets to contract . 
In this sense , what the crisis reveals is that the gains of nondemocratic countries have ultimately depended on the economic engine provided by the world 's advanced democracies . 
Democrats can hardly gloat about the fallout from the crisis , given the breadth of the suffering and the inevitability that some democracies will be at risk . 
Yet democrats ' rivals are likely to suffer even more . 
For the most part , the `` authoritarian capitalist '' regimes are not based on a coherent ideology that has wide support among their populations . 
Instead , regimes such as those in Russia and China are propped up by what political scientists call `` performance legitimacy '' : As long as they deliver the economic goods , most of their citizens may be willing to accept the accompanying limits on their political freedom . 
Russian citizens who endured poverty after the fall of communism appreciated the improvement in their quality of life that Vladimir Putin 's regime offered . 
But when such regimes stop delivering , what other sources of legitimacy can they fall back on to justify their rule ? 
Over the long term , democracies , too , may succumb if they fail to deliver , but in the short term they have other resources -- not just popular attachment to political liberty but also the ability to change their governments via elections without changing their regimes . 
Today 's authoritarian regimes are likely to be more vulnerable than their democratic counterparts . 
In the 1970s , the French political scientist Pierre Hassner used the phrase `` competitive decadence '' to describe the Cold War contest between the United States and the Soviet Union . 
This notion suggested that the superpowers were each beset with serious internal problems and that whichever side decayed more slowly was likely to emerge the winner . 
The global economic crisis may well stimulate a similar kind of dynamic between democracy and its rivals . 
But democracy 's advantages in such a struggle are not limited to its ability to take a punch and outlast its glass-jawed competitors . 
Democracy has often displayed a remarkable ability to reform and renew itself . 
This gives it a resilience that may prove decisive in the competition with its more brittle authoritarian challengers .

"Woodward : For Bush Legacy , Iraq Looms Large What will be the most defining aspect of George W. Bush 's presidency ? 
Bob Woodward and Barton Gellman explore the most significant events of the Bush-Cheney years -- from the Iraq war and waterboarding , to Hurricane Katrina and the financial meltdown -- in a roundtable discussion with Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson . 
Watch the full video interview , or click through the transcript at right to view segments by topic . 
Bob , you have written three books now about the Bush administration ... WOODWARD : And my wife says if there 's a fifth she 's gonna shoot me . 
-LRB- Laughter -RRB- ROBINSON : Obviously there 's something that fascinates you about this administration . 
So what do you think is the one thing George Bush is going to be remembered for ? 
WOODWARD : Well , I think he 's going to be remembered for lots of things . 
The defining event is the Iraq war , because that was a war of choice . 
As we know that war is not over , 146,000 troops there , almost the same number of civilian contractors . 
It is a massive land army in presence in the heart of the Middle East . 
Gen. Petraeus is keeping that large force there because he knows its not over , it 's not stabilized . 
Ah , Bush of course hopes that that 's going to turn out well and there is an outside chance it 's possible and he 'll be Harry Truman . 
It 's also possible that its ' going to , and the preponderance of the evidence is , that it may not turn out well . 
And , so , but you know the financial crisis is a giant legacy , and I 'm wondering what the financial crisis is going to be called . 
Is it going to be called Wall Street-gate , Capitalism-gate , ah , Bush-gate , Cheney-gate ? 
ROBINSON : Since you are responsible for the original gate , we 're not going to call it a gate at all , -LRB- laughter -RRB- we 're going to call it the financial crisis . 
We 'll get , we 'll get back to Iraq I 'm sure . 
But I want to ask Bart . 
Bart , your book Angler is the definitive look at Dick Cheney and so I want to ask you the same question . 
What is the one thing Dick Cheney is going to be remembered for ? 
BART GELLMAN : I think Dick Cheney is going to be remembered for his attempt to expand the powers of the executive and the presidency and for his overreach on that front and for the backlash that came against him . 
ROBINSON : Was he indeed a uniquely powerful vice president ? 
GELLMAN : He clearly was uniquely powerful as vice president . 
I think in the modern era he 's the most powerful person who 's ever held high office who was not president . 
He 's the nearest thing I guess you could say to the deputy president we 've ever had . 
3 -RRB- The Roots of War ROBINSON : You know Bob , I would tend to agree , just in general , that Iraq is probably the headline of the Bush-Cheney administration . 
So take me back . 
Where was the germ for Iraq really laid ? 
Does it come out of the first Gulf War ? 
Does it come out of 9\/11 ? 
Where does it come from ? 
WOODWARD : Well , it comes from like all historical causation a convergence of events . 
9\/11 was significant , changed the world . 
I agree with Bart that Cheney was such a presence after 9\/11 , such a steamroller for the offensive mode that became really the Bush doctrine . 
That it was in the chronology from 9\/11 until they launched the Iraq war , the war plan looked easier . 
So it was going to be quick , as Cheney with great intensity said , we 're going to be welcomed with sweets and flowers . 
There was a sense that we had to do something . 
There was a sense that was valid that Saddam was a bad actor . 
But when you look back on that , and study it and study particularly the neglect and the failure to manage the aftermath , it 's hard to look at it as a good thing . 
ROBINSON : Bart , how do you see Dick Cheney 's role in the run-up to the Iraq War , indeed , in the decision to go to war in Iraq . 
GELLMAN : His role , and in fact his chief of staff 's Scooter Libby 's role , were very important . 
I like what Bob said about convergence . 
I think that George Bush and Dick Cheney sort of came to the gates of Baghdad by way of two very different paths , and they converged on the same point of view and the same decision . 
Cheney saw this in much more sort of classical security and balance of power terms . 
He wanted to send a message . 
Some of his staff told me , and this was something we did n't know before , that he was looking for a demonstration effect . 
The idea you sort of knock one bad guy down to send a message to others . 
He was actually more worried about North Korea and Iran as constituting this nexus he always talked about between hostile state , WMD and terrorists who would use them . 
But those were not attractive military options , and he hoped to deter them with this kind of war . 
I mean , the other surprising thing that we did n't know before , is that despite his public comments , Cheney was quite ambivalent about the war . 
He thought it was a close call . 
Once he made the call , and once the president made the call more importantly , he would go and make it a 100 percent case in public . 
But he was worried it would n't turn out well . 
WOODWARD : And the other factor here is the mind of George Bush . 
In one interview , he told me , I believe we have a duty to free people , to liberate people . 
And that liberation , the freedom agenda , was a giant driver . 
You had the support , the encouragement of Cheney , the intelligence community saying Saddam has weapons of mass destruction . 
And Bush looked at this , ah , as an opportunity . 
And I think when he stood on the deck of the aircraft carrier with the well-remembered sign mission accomplished , he had that sense . 
They 've done it , they 've really pulled something off that was going to be important . 
I 've reached the conclusion , I never kind of questioned Bush 's sincerity . 
I think he really wanted to do the right thing . 
The problem is , and this if you 're looking for a theme in all of this , it juxtaposes very dramatically with Cheney . 
Bush does n't like homework , whereas Cheney - ROBINSON : Right , he does all his homework , does n't he - WOODWARD : Cheney is all homework , is all homework and he knows how to marshal arguments and evidence . 
And so after the appearance on the aircraft carrier was that sense , `` Oh , we 've done it . '' 
And of course on the ground in Iraq is the intelligence people who were telling Bush and Cheney both , `` This is turning into a catastrophe . '' 
And they did n't wake up for really years . 
Your Opinion : Was Bush right to order the Iraq War ? 
ROBINSON : In terms of deciding to go to war in Iraq and also how to prosecute the war , I do wonder what impact 9\/11 had on the mindset of each man . 
I ask because I 've been talking to another of the principals who was in and around the White House that day , and I once in a conversation I said , um , something to the effect , I know what it must have been like in the administration that day . 
And this person said , `` No you do n't . 
You have no idea what it felt like , the feeling that we had missed something , the feeling that we were under attack , the feeling that we had to do everything we could to avoid another attack . '' 
Was that sort of sense of responsibility , weighty responsibility present in Dick Cheney ? 
Was it present in George Bush ? 
GELLMAN : Yea , it 's hard to remember how intense that moment was . 
It was n't just that , sort of Dick Cheney in the bunker under the White House and President Bush sort of outside a Florida classroom and then on Air Force One , are watching the great symbols of American capitalism and American military might falling down , or burning . 
It 's that they believed another attack was very likely imminent . 
That there were crucial things they did n't know and that something worse might be right around the corner . 
And that 's why Cheney begged George Bush not to come back to Washington right away . 
And Bush eventually overruled all of his advisers including the Secret Service to come back . 
But the idea that Washington might not be here tomorrow . 
And so Dick Cheney pressed very hard on the idea that we have to take off all the restraints . 
And for him , although there 's a lot of disagreement with this in the intelligence community , coercion , cruelty works in interrogations . 
For him , ah , domestic surveillance was essential . 
What good is listening in to terrorists overseas when the ones who might already be in our borders are the ones that we really have to worry about ? 
And right down the line , and so 9\/11 on the one hand intensified Cheney 's longstanding views about the sort of over-bureaucratization and over-legalization of national security and on the other hand gave him an opportunity to press that agenda . 
WOODWARD : And he kind of became the self-appointed examiner of worst-case scenarios . 
And that , I mean , Ron Suskind in his book The One Percent Solution -LRB- sic : The One Percent Doctrine -RRB- - if there 's a one percent chance that it might happen , you have to take all steps . 
And-see if Bart agrees with this because he 's the expert on it-the nightmare for Cheney was a nuke going off in an American city , and that is not something you can dismiss . 
And he was right analytically that that had to be prevented . 
If that happened and hundreds of thousands of people were killed , 9\/11 would be a footnote in the history books . 
So , I remember going to interview Cheney in October of 2001 . 
And I had known him quite well and interviewed him extensively when he was defense secretary for the first Gulf War . 
And he was kind of laid back and direct . 
But he was just like a stretched rubber band in October 2001 . 
He was , he was just off balance to the extent that Dick Cheney ever gives off balance . 
And it was this fear , a legitimate fear , and Bart uses the right word I think , that in there response there was an overreaching that maybe looked necessary at the moment . 
But there should have been somebody there saying , you know , about the wiretapping-it 's called domestic surveillance , I think it 's kind of really not domestic surveillance , but it 's listening in on these calls from people in this country , abroad , which they do all the time-and somebody should have said now wait a minute , let 's legitimize this , let 's legalize it , let 's make some of this transparent rather than crawl in the bunker . 
And so they really - ROBINSON : They certainly did n't want to , and the surveillance or wiretapping or eavesdropping , the secret CIA prisons , and as far as I 'm concerned , the interrogations which you mentioned . 
How does a fundamentally decent man like George Bush , a fundamentally decent man like Dick Cheney get to the point where they can sit in the , you know , the White House and discuss torturing people ? 
WOODWARD : Well , I mean I think what they did in the White House is they avoided the details and they did n't really ask the kinds of questions they should have had . 
What does this mean enhanced interrogation ? 
So I do n't think we 're going to find was that vivid discussion of it . 
What I think happened is they had this responsibility for protecting the country . 
If there had been other attacks , large attacks , many attacks , quite frankly-and this does n't speak well to the country - probably these things would n't have been an issue , people would have accepted it and the dark side would have been okay . 
The problem is there were n't more attacks , and that 's another thing for books in the future , exactly why that happened . 
But they did n't realize , and of course leadership entails looking at changed circumstances and altering your behavior , and they did n't do that . 
GELLMAN : If I could just say a word on this . 
First of all , Cheney persuaded Bush not to go to Congress to ask for legislation on things like surveillance and interrogation because asking means you think you need permission . 
And it 's Cheney 's view that the president does n't need permission . 
And so surprisingly to a lot of people , Cheney played very little role in the Patriot Act . 
He was interested in what Bush could do on his own . 
I have to disagree in emphasis I think a little bit with you , Bob , about the details of interrogations , because you 've talked to all these people . 
People who were in the room during these crucial meetings , especially in 2003 and 2004 , say they got very explicit about what was going to be done , and they got very explicit because George Tenet demanded it . 
Tenet was saying , `` Do n't give me vague instructions , tell me to interpret them and then hang us out to dry one day . 
If I 'm going to go ahead with waterboarding or sleep deprivation , you 're going to know exactly what we 're doing . '' 
WOODWARD : I guess there 's a big dispute on that , and it will be interesting to see when all of the sides are presented . 
And , ah , waterboard - I mean there 's a way to describe waterboarding where it 's kind of is , what did Cheney call it ? 
A `` dunk '' or something like that ? 
A dunk in the water - ROBINSON : We 're not dunking for apples , I do n't think so - WOODWARD : And then there 's a way to describe the way it really is , and I think they got , as often the case-and this is the theme , the lack of homework-they got sugarcoated versions of these things and they persuaded themselves , `` Well this is going to work and this is necessary . '' 
And that 's a giant part of their legacy . 
GELLMAN : But Cheney had actually been thinking about coercion and interrogations for a very long time . 
Back in the 80s he sat on the intelligence committee at the time when William Buckley , the station chief of the CIA in Beirut was kidnapped , tortured and killed by Hezbollah . 
And as a member of the committee he got a chance to review some videotape of Buckley and his treatment and it was gruesome . 
And Cheney expressed a lot of concern at that time about what the implications were for U.S. secrets in the Mideast . 
His premise was torture works . 
Now in this administration they 've redefined torture so narrowly that it 's actually almost impossible to commit it . 
But he explicitly was arguing for throwing off the restraints against cruelty - cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment , that 's the language of Geneva - that he said did n't and should n't apply . 
WOODWARD : What 's interesting , and this goes right to the core , did Bush-whose responsible for all of this-ask questions and have the mindset to kind of say , `` Hey what are you really doing , what does this involve ? 
Let 's get detail so I know what I 'm approving . '' 
And as I understand it , they skimmed over that as Bush skimmed over so many things . 
GELLMAN : This is where the whole homework point comes in and it 's exactly right . 
Bush got by all his life on charm and instinct , and his ability to read people . 
And Cheney was Mr. Homework , he came to class , he did n't read the book , he read the teacher 's edition . 
7 -RRB- Responding to Hurricane Katrina ROBINSON : Exactly . 
Moving on , let 's just switch one topic for a second . 
I 'd like to move to a couple of domestic issues . 
Hurricane Katrina , and the response to that : I was in New Orleans the week of the flood and I just saw things that made me lose sleep for months afterward , -LRB- things -RRB- I just did n't think I could , I would ever see in an American city . 
How do you read the administration 's response , or lack of response , to Katrina ? 
To what would you attribute that ? 
WOODWARD : It 's exactly what we 're talking about : a failure to understand and involve yourself in details so you make the right decisions . 
As we know now , Bush said he did n't get the weather report and there 's video of him getting the weather report , whether it sunk in or not . 
And that was a symbol . 
And what was so interesting about the response was that they could n't recover in time to kind of show real leadership and an identification with the agony you witnessed firsthand . 
GELLMAN : One of the secrets of Cheney 's success is that he decides what he cares about and what he does n't , and he did n't care about this in terms of a mission for the federal government , in terms of a mission for him . 
Bush actually asked him , we did n't know this before , to be the czar of the government 's response . 
He is , after all , maybe the preeminent crisis manager of the administration , an extremely talented manager . 
And he politely declined . 
You know , he did n't say and he would never say that he would refuse an order from the president . 
He said , `` If it 's all the same to you Mr. President , I 'll focus elsewhere . '' 
And Bush expressed some irritation with that , according to Dan Bartlett who talked about the meeting . 
So bush asked him to go down , assess how it 's going . 
He came back and said , `` This guy you just said ` heck of a job Brownie ' is a disaster , '' but he washed his hands of it after that . 
ROBINSON : So the picture that emerges , the president had made Michael Brown , the former official with the International Arabian Horse Association , head of FEMA , our emergency response agency . 
It 's a complete disaster . 
In other words , it 's not the sort of detail , that part of governing , the actual nuts and bolts of governing , is not the kind of sort of detail that George Bush would have paid attention to and if it was n't something that Dick Cheney was n't interested in , it did n't necessarily get done ? 
Is that - WOODWARD : Yea , I think that 's exactly right . 
I mean you decoded it , Bart , when Cheney would n't step in , that meant there was a vacuum . 
Your Opinion : What is the most defining aspect of the Bush-Cheney administration ?

GELLMAN : The details glaze George Bush 's eyes . 
Just take the federal budget -- this is where the government puts its money where its mouth is . 
It has enormous impact . 
In every other administration , and Bob would testify to this , if a cabinet officer or secretary of state or defense says , `` White House you 're not giving me enough money and it 's a really big deal , '' they 'd come to the president and they 'd appeal it in the Oval Office . 
In this administration , the bucks stop at Dick Cheney kind of literally . 
He was the head of a newly-invented budget review board , and that shielded George Bush from the details he did n't want . 
WOODWARD : When I interviewed Bush this May , so about seven , eight months ago , about the Iraq War , for two mornings in the Oval Office I kept looking around Bush 's chair to see if there was a suitcase packed - WOODWARD : -- because he had that sense of , `` I 'm getting out of here , '' an impatience with questions . 
I mean at one point , he just kind of turned to Hadley , the national security adviser who was also there during the interviews , and said , `` Huh , we 're going to have to go through all of this . '' 
And here , he had a chance - because the questions were very `` What did you think , what did you do , why did you do it ? '' 
- a megaphone to kind of explain what he did . 
And instead of using that as an opportunity , he got impatient . 
He literally said at one point , `` I 'm hungry-my lunch is waiting . '' 
You know - ROBINSON : You ca n't have that . 
WOODWARD : - Why are you bothering me with this Iraq War that I decided on and I am responsible for and has not gone well for so many years ? 
It 's mildly mind-boggling . 
GELLMAN : It 's almost a bookend of your four books . 
You know you start off with Andy Card going to fetch a hamburger because the president asked him to from the early account , and with his legacy being interrupted for lunch . 
ROBINSON : Is there any , sort of looking back , reflection , self-criticism from Dick Cheney ? 
GELLMAN : Cheney is in the never apologize , never explain school in public . 
On the other hand , he is very interested in honest after-action reports , after-action assessments . 
There was a defense intelligence agency analyst named Derek Harvey , who came to the White House and gave a very sort of dark assessment of progress of the war in Iraq . 
Bush heard him once and never wanted to hear it again , Cheney called him back over and over again . 
He was saying things that Cheney was saying-they were the opposite of what Cheney was saying in public , and Cheney kept saying it in public-but he wanted to know . 
He wanted to know that fine-grained detail , he wanted to learn lessons from it . 
I doubt he 'll ever say it . 
Liz Cheney , his older daughter , wants him to write a memoir , but this is so out of keeping with everything we know about him , I 'd be surprised . 
WOODWARD : Lynn Cheney told me , I think it was last year sometime , that she and her husband , the vice president , Dick Cheney , are going to do some kind of book . 
So we will see . 
But Bart 's exactly right , there is-and Derek Harvey is a magnificent example of somebody bringing the truth in a very authoritative way , and Bush was just , `` Oh my God , I do n't want to deal with this . '' 
And Cheney had him back , and back , and back . 
Your Opinion : Who exerted greater political influence ? 
10 -RRB- The Financial Crisis and Barack Obama 's Transition ROBINSON : I do n't think we can finish this conversation without touching on the financial crisis . 
Is this , how do we assess the administration 's performance ? 
Temptation is to say somebody was asleep at the switch . 
Obviously it 's not entirely the fault of any White House . 
But how do-were they paying attention ? 
How do you see this . 
WOODWARD : The real honest answer is , we do n't know . 
We 're in the early stages of it . 
One CEO who traveled up to New York , said it 's nice to be in this backwater because I come from Washington , D.C. , which is now the financial capital of the United States , because we own all the banks . 
WOODWARD : And , ah , we being the taxpayers . 
There is going to be , not a day of reckoning , but a series of years of reckoning on this . 
And the question , legitimately always goes back to , the famous Nixon question : What did the president know and when did he know it on these issues ? 
I happened to sit sometime earlier this year in an off-the-record dinner where Cheney was there , and one of Wall Street 's barons spoke , Cheney sat next to him , and the baron said , `` We are going into the soup . 
We are in and on the edge of a real crisis . '' 
And Cheney just kind of sat there and smiled . 
And at the end of the dinner , I said , if I ever right a novel about the financial collapse in the United States , it 's going to open with this dinner . 
-LRB- laughter -RRB- ROBINSON : Yea , but , that just does n't compute , to me , with what we know about Dick Cheney . 
This is not , does n't seem to me to be the kind of detail that would slip his attention . 
GELLMAN : Here 's how it does compute . 
Cheney never shows his cards , as Bob well knows . 
He will sit through a long meeting and answer a lot of questions , often , but he does n't even reveal his leanings . 
That 's something he develops privately . 
And the problem with knowing a lot about it in this administration is that Cheney really is a purist on free market , and as strong an anti-regulator you get in the upper reaches of government . 
And there was a reluctance to conceptualize , for example , the big banks running what amounts to a big utility and controlling in many ways the supply of money in the economy , shifting risk to the taxpayers , which is the government 's job . 
And so it 's not all government , and it 's not all Bush , because it started with Clinton . 
But the decisive hands off in regulation of Wall Street came under Bush for very direct reasons that they did n't believe in regulation . 
ROBINSON : Right , right . 
No , they did n't believe in it , and , but , you know again , Cheney is big on after-action reports . 
If you see that something is n't working , I just think of him as being pragmatic enough to take a look at it . 
But , but , you 're right - WOODWARD : As Bart says , it 's not his portfolio , it 's not his focus , and I think one of the Cheney rules is , focus on the big issue . 
Keep your eye on the ball . 
And he still is haunted-and rightly so , it 's good somebody is haunted about the possibility of a serious nuke going off in an American city-and those are all real issues . 
And , you know , on a positive note , at least to this point there has not been another attack in this country - GELLMAN : Nuke or biological weapons was his other huge focus - GELLMAN : And the question arises , in reference to what you said earlier , how many one percent threats can you afford to face now ? 
How many can you afford to treat as if there one percent , because , we do n't have the resources and we ca n't afford the price of addressing every one of those as if it 's a certainty ? 
As one example , Cheney wanted Bush to order that every American be inoculated against smallpox , because even though it 's been eradicated as a disease , he feared it might be placed in the hands of terrorists as a weapon . 
Bush found out that this was going to kill two - or three-hundred Americans . 
Dan Bartlett says he was sitting in the room wondering how he 's going to sell that as a public relations campaign , and Bush got off the bus . 
He said , I 'm just not going to kill several hundred people against a maybe threat down the road . 
WOODWARD : That 's a perfect example of that , but you get-what , you know , what is the condition of the country that is handed to Barack Obama ? 
And you know , that ultimately , I mean the Bush legacy starts on January 20 , 2009 . 
ROBINSON : We have a few minutes left , and I just want to ask a question to each of you . 
George Bush and Dick Cheney leave office at the height of unpopularity . 
Bush 's popularity ratings are subterranean , there 's a feeling of `` Let 's just get it over with and get on with the new thing . '' 
How - WOODWARD : Dick Cheney jokes , it 's funny , about Bush tells this joke about -LRB- how -RRB- Cheney will come to him and say , `` Hey , Mr. President , how do you get your popularity ratings so high ? '' 
Because compared to Cheney , they are . 
-LRB- laughter -RRB- ROBINSON : So Bart , with what you know about Dick Cheney , his joking aside , is that how it affects him ? 
Or does it have more of an impact ? 
GELLMAN : I think he really , truly , as much as anyone who ever held a high office , does not care what we think . 
He has his eye on the verdict of history , he 's pretty sure he knows what that verdict will be . 
And he does n't believe that public opinion is competent to make decisions on government ROBINSON : He 's going to -LRB- unintelligible -RRB- for the historians . 
GELLMAN : Although , although he gets in their way too , because he has put up a lot of road blocks to historians finding out what really happened . 
ROBINSON : That 's true , that 's another - WOODWARD : There 's a lot of evidence to support what Bart says about Cheney - ROBINSON : But what about Bush ? 
WOODWARD : - but my sense of Cheney and Bush is that they do care . 
That this idea , particularly with Cheney and you know the steel shield that he carries around , that underneath it 's not fun to be such a figure of disregard and hostility . 
And in the end , I think that 's the way Bush looks at it , and it hurts . 
ROBINSON : George Bush has essentially said , as Fidel Castro said in his famous trial in 1953 , you know , history will absolve me . 
Does he believe that history will absolve him ? 
WOODWARD : To a certain extent , that 's all he 's got . 
GELLMAN : Dick Armey , who was once a very close ally to both men , the minority leader of the Republicans in the House , told me that if you 're looking , if you 're sitting in Bush or Cheney 's shoes now , it would behoove you to think that history will absolve you . 
But he , and old friend and ally of theirs , said that he thinks that history will judge both of them quite harshly . 
ROBINSON : Well , thank you both for being here this morning , Bob Woodward and Bart Gellman . 
For The Washington Post and washingtonpost.com , I 'm Gene Robinson and thanks for tuning in . 
Your Opinion : Will George W. Bush 's public image improve with time ?

"Obama Adviser Urges More Rigorous Global Financial Regulation Paul Volcker was the lead author on a report calling for a restructuring of the global financial system . 
-LRB- By Mark Lennihan -- Associated Press -RRB- NEW YORK , Jan. 15 -- A top economic adviser to the incoming Obama administration unveiled a plan Thursday to radically rethink the global financial system , including measures that would dramatically expand government control over banking and investment in the United States . 
The report -- which recommends limiting the size of banks , monitoring executive pay and regulating hedge funds -- offers the first hint of the kind of change to the financial system that President-elect Barack Obama may push for in coming months . 
Obama has pledged to present a package of reforms to prevent another round of the financial crisis that began in the United States , ahead of a summit of world leaders in London this April . 
Observers saw in Thursday 's report potential building blocks of Obama 's plan . 
Although issued by the Group of 30 -- an organization of international economists and financial policymakers -- its lead author is Paul Volcker , the chairman of the Federal Reserve during the Carter and Reagan administrations who will serve as a special adviser to the Obama White House . 
Part of Volcker 's role is to help mastermind what could become the biggest overhaul of the U.S. financial system in decades . 
`` I think this is a clear sign that the new administration is going to push for a major overhaul , for major structural reforms of the regulatory system , '' said Steven Schrage , the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . 
`` Having this highly esteemed group backing that proposal is going to put pressure to present those changes before -LRB- the -RRB- April summit . '' 
The report 's recommendations may find support among those in the United States and Europe who have called for tighter regulation over the financial system in the wake of the current economic crisis . 
But elements of the plan were already opposed Thursday by some in the financial industry , where some worry that the push for tighter government regulation may go too far . 
The report offered 18 recommendations that would insert government regulators into the boardrooms of financial institutions as never before . 
The plan calls for vastly increased oversight of major banks , going as far as to recommend the end of an era of mega banks whose size makes their failure potentially catastrophic to the global financial system . 
To limit their size and scope , banks , the document states , should be prohibited from managing private-equity or hedge funds . 
And deposits should not be concentrated in the hands of too few banks . 
`` Keep them small , so that any failure wo n't have systematic importance , '' Volcker said at a news conference . 
Money-market mutual funds that offer services similar to banks , including dollar-for-dollar withdrawal at any time , should be subjected to increased government oversight , the report said . 
Currently , most do not operate that way . 
But those bank-like mutual funds that want to avoid tighter regulation should sell relatively safe financial instruments and clearly state to customers that the value of their funds may or may not remain stable . 
The proposal suggests that the U.S. government should clarify the status of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , either making them government agencies or regulating them as independent mortgage brokers . 
Credit-rating agencies would also be subjected to greater scrutiny . 
Volcker said he would press the new administration to consider the measures , saying major changes are imperative because the financial system is `` broken . '' 
`` It 's a four-letter word , '' he said . 
`` It 's a mess . '' 
Elements of the plan -- such as imposing regulation on hedge funds -- echo calls for closer supervision made by policymakers in the United States and abroad in past months . 
But Thursday 's report was more specific and aggressive in imposing government restrictions on the financial system than a broad outline of changes agreed to by the Bush administration during a meeting of leaders representing the Group of 20 economic powers in Washington last November . 
The Obama administration is expected to work closely with key congressional leaders including Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass -RRB- on legislation that could restructure existing regulatory agencies and impose new guidelines on U.S. financial institutions . 
The scope of Volcker 's proposal , analysts say , suggests that Obama 's plan may contain highly ambitious reforms . 
Although financial industry officials concede that more regulation is likely needed to prevent a repeat of the current crisis , they also said that some of the measures in the report appeared to go too far . 
For instance , they opposed the suggestion that banks limit their deposits and size . 
`` You want to apply the appropriate amount of regulation to address the concern that this kind of crisis never happens again , '' said Scott Talbott , senior vice president of government affairs for Financial Services Roundtable , which represents the largest financial institutions in the United States . 
`` But at the same time , you do n't want to stifle innovation , creativity or the allocation of resources to take appropriate risks . '' 
Although the report calls for global reform , it acknowledged charges that flaws in the U.S. financial system were to blame for starting the current global economic crisis . 
Thusly , it noted that `` several of the issues and recommendations have a direct U.S. focus . '' 
The report renewed calls for greater international cooperation on regulation , and new laws to oversee exotic financial derivatives , made during the November summit in Washington . 
With cautious support by President Bush , plans are moving forward , for instance , to enhance international cooperation in overseeing major banks through the Financial Stability Forum in Switzerland . 
But European leaders have eagerly awaited a signal from Obama on his ideas for new rules for the global financial system . 
It is unclear how many of the recommendations will make their way into Obama 's final plan , but the report could lift the spirits of Europeans who have called for tighter government oversight on executives ' pay and risk management in financial institutions -- an area where the Bush administration has offered tepid support . 
The report urges the government to enforce systematic board reviews of executive pay as well as new guidelines to measure the level of risk a firm is taking with exotic investments .

The nation 's financial crisis has become a bookend to President Bush 's two terms . 
When Bush leaves office next Tuesday , he will hand over an economy struggling to recover from the collapse of the housing market and a Wall Street shake-up that led to the disappearance of banking giant Lehman Brothers , the fire sale of Merrill Lynch and the creation of a $ 700 billion federal bailout fund to stem the tide . 
The infusion of government money was pushed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke but Bush has pledged that the government will be able to '' recoup much , if not all , of the original expenditure . '' 
It 's unclear what impact the government bailout will have on the fledgling economy , with experts warning that it could take months or years for the financial cloud to lift . 
Bob Woodward , the investigative reporter who authored four books on the Bush presidency , recounted an off-the-record dinner last year . 
Vice President Dick Cheney was one of the attendees and one of `` Wall Street 's barons '' turned to Cheney and said , `` We are going into the soup . 
We are in and on the edge of a real crisis . '' 
Cheney `` just kind of sat there and smiled , '' Woodward said . 
In a 13-minute speech last night to the nation on the eve of President-elect Barack Obama 's inauguration , Bush defended many of his policies , adding that , `` These are very tough times for hardworking families , but the toll would be far worse if we had not acted , '' he said . 
`` All Americans are in this together . 
And together , with determination and hard work , we will restore our economy to the path of growth . ''

Bush Legacy : Financial Crises ??? that 's not the legacy , just the bookend , as you so aptly pointed out . 
The real Legacy is the Bush Legacy Deficit which comes from the Republican Administration and Republican Congress going on The World 's Largest Spending Spree ... and they worked tirelessly to create it . 
Bush never vetoed a spending bill , even the porked up ones -- unless they were Democrat Sponsored . 
Then he mumbled something -LRB- every time -RRB- about those ` tax and spend Democrats . 
If Republicans can call Democrats ` tax-and-spend-democrats ' , then let us label Republicans with a description , not of their words , of their own actions : 8 years of `` Spend and Borrow Republicans '' . 
Republicans used to call themselves the party of fiscal responsibility , but their actions are the actions of fiscal wastrels . 
Over $ 10 trillion in debt , not counting the Clinton surplus . 
I learned early that borrowing should be only for capital necessities and improvements . 
And for all that money spent , there 's almost nothing we can show to our kids and grandkids with pride , except the Bush Legacy Deficit . 
That , Mr Woodard is the investigation for you to pursue . 
We desperately need a handle on that Bush Legacy Deficit . 
It is so big that none of us can conceive its ' size or import , nor quite how it got put together . 
Will you do That for us , please ???? Posted by : thetravelingmasseur | January 16 , 2009 8:56 PM Crashing the economy twice is just one of the wonderful achievments of dubya . 
In only 8 years he destroyed the reputation of the United States , started an unecessary war based on lies , and then because he did no planning or homework almost crashed the world energy infrastructure as a result . 
He increased world terrorism by a magnitude of 3 according to our own government records . 
He twiddled his thumbs for the better part of a decade as global warming threatened the survival of our species . 
He denigrated the US moral reputation by using methods devised by the insidious Spanish Inquisition . 
He tried to break down the wall separating church and state that our Founding Fathers so carefully erected to protect the integroity of both . 
He allowed private contractors , billionaires , and fossil fuel companies to rape the nation . 
He claimed powers that do n't exist . 
The list is so relentless it gets tiresome just jotting down all the disasters that one can name off the top of the head . 
The bush legacy is one of relentless failure and disasterous wrongheaded decisions based on the obdurate clinging to a fallacious ideology . 
And for those who try to be kind by saying bush was `` a good man '' - look at the record and get real . 
This guy is a first class spoiled rich arse fardle who throws tantrums when he does n't get his way and treats anyone who disagrees with him worse than dirt . 
Petulant , childish , vindictive , intellectually challenged , half-cocked , stubborn , ill mannered , ill tempered jerk is closer to the description that fits . 
He deserved far more than just one set of shoes thrown his way . 
Their idea of a hot babe , Anne Coulter wanted to kill Democrats . 
Cheney smiled when told the country was going in the toilet . 
He and his disgusting friends made billions in war profiteering . 
They can smile while we lose our homes . 
And they called Sadam a `` madman '' . 
But , the Iraq war has killed ` only ' a few thousand Americans -LRB- albeit many more Iraqis -RRB- , and the number of people held at Guantanamo is in the hundreds . 
But how about the Bush admin . 
's embrace of the beleaguered tobacco industry , which kills tens of thousands of people in the U.S. every year , and many more in the rest of the world ? 
And his heroic defense of the gun industry , whose products also kill tens of thousands of people in the U.S. , and many more overseas ? 
One could also mention the oil , coal and lots of others I do n't know about . 
Bush 's less-observed policies look the most destructive to me . 
Blind adherence to ideology is at the root of it all . 
Anti-government , anti-dissent , anti-environment , pro-unfettered corporate management , pro-religion intrusion , the list is long . 
Extreme right wing reactionaries willing to use the power of the government to serve the few . 
He was a Tyrant in every sense of the word . 
May your souls rot in hell for the destruction you have wrought . 
But you are not alone . 
Those who followed your ideology , who believed your lies and deceptions , you are all responsible . 
You made it possible for thieves and cowards to profit at the expense of honest hard working people . 
You stole our future , you sent men to die to satisfy your despicable egos . 
You have brought shame and hatred upon our once great nation . 
You talk about our brave troops sacrificing them selves for liberty . 
No , Bush , YOU `` SACRIFICED '' THEM . 
Over four thousand good service men and women have died to satisfy your pride . 
You did not bring democracy to Iraq , you brought death and destruction , the division of cities into zones of hatred between religious factions , the ascent of the ignorant and venal . 
You allowed superstition and ideology to undermine science and knowledge . 
You have not spread democracy , you have spread hate and destruction .

"Before Robin Bohnen and her husband , Shane , bought a $ 1.16 million Mediterranean-style house in an upscale Southern California suburb two years ago , they were not cash-strapped , debt-ridden or credit-impaired . 
Now they are all of the above . 
Soon they also may qualify for one more distressing category : home lost to foreclosure . 
`` Wake me up , can this really be happening ? '' 
the 42-year-old Bohnen says . 
As she tries to describe how it feels to have the nation 's financial crisis land in her living room , the phone rings . 
`` It 's probably the bank -- again , '' she says . 
Bohnen once owed her comfortable lifestyle to the dizzying growth that transformed Southern California over the past decade , creating a boom that led many to believe their home values would keep climbing . 
As the owner of a furniture store born during the housing boom , she provided bean bag chairs and bedroom sets for the brand-new communities that easy credit built . 
Now , she and husband just owe . 
They can not afford their $ 6,400 monthly payment , and in this plummeting market , they would n't make enough on a sale to pay off their mortgage or recoup the 20 percent they put down to buy their Riverside County home . 
They 're `` underwater , '' industry parlance for borrowers who owe more on their mortgage than their houses are worth . 
They have joined the growing line of homeowners seeking a break from their lenders . 
Both the departing and incoming administrations in Washington have promised help on the foreclosure front , but providing help requires federal regulators to get their collective arms around the size and shape of the crisis . 
That is n't easy . 
No one agency collects information on every loan , every borrower and every delinquency . 
But interviews and a Washington Post analysis of available data show that the foreclosure crisis knows no class or income boundaries . 
Many borrowers ensnared in the evolving mortgage mess do not fit neatly into the stereotypes that surfaced by early 2007 when delinquency rates shot up . 
They do n't have subprime loans , the lending industry 's jargon for the higher-rate mortgages made to borrowers with shaky credit or without enough cash for a down payment . 
The wave of subprime delinquencies appears to have crested . 
But in October , for the first time , the number of prime mortgages in delinquency exceeded the subprime loans in danger of default , according to The Post 's analysis . 
This trend shows up most acutely in California and other high-growth regions , such as Arizona , Nevada , Florida and pockets of the Washington region , most notably in Prince William and Prince George 's counties . 
The recession has made it tougher for people to pay their mortgages , and crashing home prices have left many borrowers underwater , unable to sell or refinance their way out of trouble . 
One of every five mortgage holders now has a home worth less than the mortgage on it , according to First American CoreLogic , a firm that tracks mortgages and provided data for The Post 's analysis . 
Of the 20 Zip codes with the highest share of underwater loans , seven are in California and four are in Riverside County , the vast exurb southeast of Los Angeles where the Bohnens live . 
Riverside 's unemployment rate has zoomed to 10 percent , well above the national average of 7.2 percent . 
About 94,200 people in the county are looking for work , many of them formerly employed in the real estate , banking and construction industries , according to the county 's economic development agency . 
"
"A housing bubble bursting , banks faltering toward failure , a nation plunging into recession . 
The year was 1991 , and the Swedish government responded with a dramatic plan : Unpaid loans and other troubled assets would be dumped into new state-owned banks , scrubbing the banking industry of problems in the hope of sparking a lending revival . 
U.S. government officials now are considering a similar plan to address the simmering financial crisis , part of a broader discussion about ways to revamp a federal rescue effort that has helped curb panic but failed to slow bank losses or increase lending . 
The idea of creating a `` bad bank '' to quarantine troubled assets is one of several approaches being considered , but it has gained momentum among President-elect Barack Obama 's economic advisers and banking regulators . 
With all of the approaches , there could be hitches : Several senior officials suggested that the government is likely to need more than the roughly $ 320 billion remaining in the financial rescue program . 
The renewed focus on toxic assets completes a trip around the block for the government 's rescue efforts . 
In October , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. persuaded Congress to allocate $ 700 billion toward a financial rescue by describing a plan in which the government would buy troubled assets from banks . 
Instead , they chose to focus on direct capital investments . 
The investments helped some banks endure through autumn , but bank losses have continued to grow , threatening to overwhelm the government 's support and preventing the banks from finding private investors . 
The government was forced to fashion a pair of ad-hoc bailouts for Citigroup in November and Bank of America on Friday . 
`` A continuing barrier to private investment in financial institutions is the large quantity of troubled , hard-to-value assets that remain on institutions ' balance sheets , '' Bernanke said last week . 
`` The presence of these assets significantly increases uncertainty about the underlying value of these institutions and may inhibit both new private investment and new lending . '' 
The government could engage in direct purchases of troubled assets , but doing so would require an enormous amount of money to buy a meaningful volume . 
Another option under consideration is guaranteeing to limit losses on portfolios of troubled loans , as the government has done for Bank of America and Citigroup . 
But officials are loath to hammer out deals with one bank after another . 
Creating a bad bank is viewed as the most comprehensive approach . 
It is also a simple , understandable solution to a complicated problem , an important consideration in confronting what is ultimately a crisis of confidence . 
But a bad bank has never been tried on this scale , nor with assets as complicated as those held by U.S. banks . 
Bad banks are generally formed to deal with failed banks . 
And in almost every prior case , the cost to the government has been significant . 
The idea has generated interest among key Democrats . 
`` It 's something I am very interested in , but I 'd have to see the cost , '' said Sen. Charles Schumer -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- , chairman of the joint economic committee . 
One precedent for the discussions is the Resolution Trust Corp. , created by the government in 1989 to dispose of assets from the savings and loan industry . 
The RTC eventually liquidated about $ 400 billion in assets , at an estimated cost to the government of about $ 125 billion . 
The RTC is widely viewed as successful because it helped curb the crisis . 
"
"-LRB- By Frank Polich -- Associated Press -RRB- Performance-enhancing drugs , especially in baseball , and performance-enhancing leverage on Wall Street may be akin under the skin . 
I do n't insist that the parallel holds . 
But I certainly suspect it . 
Trends in society , good and bad , seldom appear in just one place . 
Sport is sometimes an area that tips us off to what 's coming . 
Perhaps something as large as a financial crisis shows itself in countless arenas and we each recognize some aspect of it in the places we understand best . 
For me at least , it seems clear that baseball hit several of the same sad landmarks as the financial world , though baseball arrived at each juncture a few years earlier . 
At the risk of an iota of optimism , the national pastime seems to have passed the nadir of its crisis of public trust within the last year . 
If only banks could mend as fast . 
Before the bosses of finance , already rich beyond imagination , took on too much risk and debt , baseball had broken fresh ground on greed , lax rules , indifference to risk and an anything-goes-if-it-makes - a-buck ethos . 
Yet it took the game a decade to slide into a sorry state . 
Starting in the late '80s , steroids made their way into the sport . 
But they were adopted slowly . 
Players , sensibly , viewed the drugs as risky , mysterious , not fully tested . 
By 1991 , steroids were also specifically against baseball 's rules . 
So , if you cared about your health , your ethics or the implications of getting caught , you had ample reason to look at `` juiced '' players and say , `` Not for me . '' 
The strike of '94 changed that . 
When the game came back in '95 after a canceled World Series , a sense of crisis was everywhere . 
Baseball 's hierarchy , in management and the union , made no pretense that they cared what players did to jack up their performance . 
The game 's popularity had to be saved . 
The ad slogan `` Chicks love the long ball '' sent a message . 
A culture , whether in sport or business , changes a click at a time , not all at once . 
By ' 98 , when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa finished their pursuit and demolition of Roger Maris 's record 61 home runs , the shift in mores was in full swing . 
If you were n't using `` whatever it takes , '' then you were at a competitive disadvantage . 
To be the greatest in the game , always the furious driving force behind seven-time MVP Barry Bonds and seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens , was n't the choice clear ? 
At that point , with the whole sport in a tacit agreement to remain silent -LRB- and set a new attendance record almost every year -RRB- , who was going to blow the whistle ? 
The excessive behavior had to run its course until some unpredicted event -- like the FBI busting a drug lab in San Francisco -- sent the secrets and sins spewing out . 
Only then could the long process of blame and recrimination , congressional outrage and public disgust , begin to take shape . 
Finally , attempts at reform , and a new attitude within the sport toward the problem , could emerge . 
Now , even a president has said , `` Wall Street got drunk and we got the hangover . '' 
But the process of inebriation took a long time , just like baseball 's spiral into widespread steroid use . 
Many of the new `` financial products '' -- which could be used to gamble more -- arrived in the '90s . 
But just as ballplayers were initially reluctant to try something as little known and dangerous as steroids , financial markets stuck one toe at a time into derivatives . 
Who knew that new concoctions , all too familiar now , like CDOs and credit default swaps , were on some math whiz 's mind . 
Just as , perhaps , the `` clear '' and the `` cream '' were still just a Balco chemist 's fantasy ? 
Steroids and human growth hormone never really took over baseball until an industry-wide trauma -- including a canceled World Series -- helped create an anything-goes ethos . 
The financial arena may have had a similar watershed crisis -- the popping of the Internet stock bubble .

"Dodd was practically born into politics . 
The five-term senator learned the ins-and-outs of elected life from his father , who was a lifelong Connecticut pol . 
But in the face of increasing unpopularity , he surprised the political world when he announced in January 2010 he would retire rather than seek reelection that year . 
Dodd was named chairman of the Motion Picture Association of American in March 2011 . 
The MPAA announced Dodd would start his new role as `` Hollywood 's top lobbyist '' later that month . 
But his prominent role in the 2008 financial meltdown caused Dodd political headaches heading into a tough 2010 reelection bid . 
As Dodd 's popularity faltered , his prospective opponents in Connecticut gained ground , and Dodd ultimately announced his retirement . 
In fall 2008 , Dodd played a crucial role in crafting the controversial $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout package known as TARP and helped oversee its implementation . 
But the chairman was also slammed by Republicans and ethics watchdogs for his close ties to to financial interests that critics argue hampered his ability to effectively regulate them in the advent of the 2008 financial crisis . 
He was also accused of writing language into the February 2009 stimulus bill that allowed $ 165 million in bonuses to AIG employees . 
After nearly three decades in the Senate , Dodd was unable to break into the Senate leadership , losing the minority leader spot by just one vote in 1994 and quickly ceding the position to Sen. Harry M. Reid -LRB- D-Nev . -RRB- 
Though he was talked about as a presidential hopeful for more than 20 years , his 2008 campaign never gained steam , and he dropped out after the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Barack Obama . 
After retiring in 2010 , Dodd was replaced by Richard Blumenthal -LRB- D -RRB- . 
More on : Christopher J. Dodd Career History : U.S. Senator -LRB- 1981-2011 -RRB- U.S. Representative -LRB- 1975 to 1981 -RRB- ; Attorney -LRB- 1972 to 1974 -RRB- Alma Mater : Providence College , B.A. , 1966 ; University of Louisville , J.D. , 1972 Dodd was born in East Haadan , Conn. . 
His father , Thomas Dodd , led the prosecution of the Nuremberg trials and was then elected to the House when Dodd was eight . 
Thomas Dodd ran for Senate in 1958 . 
After graduating from Providence College , Chris Dodd joined the Peace Corps and served in the Dominican Republic . 
During that time , Dodd 's father was censured by the Senate for misusing campaign funds . 
Dodd read about the devastating event a few days later in a Spanish paper . 
Almost immediately after graduating from law school , Dodd ran for an open U.S. House seat . 
It was the year of Watergate , and Dodd easily defeated the Republican candidate . 
In 1979 , Dodd out-maneuvered fellow Democrats to win the nomination to succeed former Sen. Abraham Ribicoff -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- . 
He succeeded , becoming Connecticut 's youngest Senator and taking over his father 's old desk . 
In 1994 , Dodd ran for Senate minority leader , but lost to then-Sen . 
Tom Daschle -LRB- D-S.D. -RRB- by just one vote . 
He was then invited by Bill Clinton to serve as chairman of the Democratic National Committee . 
Some state party leaders argued that Dodd was too liberal to serve the party , but he ably performed the job . 
Dodd left the DNC in 1997 , after accusations that he mishandled charges that a top DNC fundraiser had collected millions in illegal donations . 
He considered running for president in 2004 , but instead decided to back fellow Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman -LRB- I -RRB- . 
After former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle 's -LRB- D-Iowa -RRB- defeat , he set his sights again on the minority leader slot , but withdrew once it was clear Sen. Harry M. Reid -LRB- D-Nev . -RRB- 
Dodd announced his candidacy for president in 2007 , calling himself a `` dark horse '' with experience . 
He has served in Congress for 34 years , which would have marked more years on Capitol Hill than any president in history . 
But Dodd struggled to gain traction in a race swarming with bigger names . 
Dodd tried to gain momentum . 
He even moved his family to a house in Iowa , building his children a swing-set and enrolling his daughter in a local kindergarten . 
But his campaign never developed real momentum , despite his efforts . 
He dropped out of the race after the Iowa caucus , and endorsed Barack Obama soon afterwards . 
Dodd announced that he was being vetted by Obama for the vice presidential pick though many speculated this was a favor to Dodd and that he was not being seriously considered . 
Dodd has been re-elected to his Senate seat by wide margins . 
In 1998 , he beat his opponent with 65 percent of the vote . 
In 2004 , he faced fashion entrepreneur Jack Orchulli . 
Orchulli spent millions of his own money , but it did n't help . 
Dodd won 66 to 32 percent . 
Dodd 's popularity in his home state began to droop at the end of 2007 , when he moved his family from Connecticut to Iowa in the hopes of kick-starting his presidential campaign . 
His numbers took yet another hit when , in June 2008 , Portfolio magazine reported that Dodd along with other politicians had received mortgage loans at noncompetitive rates from Countrywide . 
Dodd said he had not known he was getting discounted rates . 
But his role in the September 2008 financial crisis may have been the nail in Dodd 's coffin . 
As chair of the Senate Banking Committee during one of the worst banking crises in American history , many asked why he had not insisted upon stronger oversight of the financial industry . 
The government 's response , a $ 700 billion bailout of Wall Street that Dodd helped draft and implement , seemed unscrupulous in the wake of the populist tremor that ran through America in the crisis 's aftermath . 
Rob Simmons -LRB- R-Conn . -RRB- 
joined the Connecticut race early , and polled strongly against Dodd throughout 2009 . 
Democrats said they would stand by their incumbent , and his numbers rose slightly in the summer of 2009 , when he took over a key role in the health-reform debates after the death of his friend and ally Sen. Edward M. Kennedy -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- . 
In July 2009 , Dodd was diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer . 
He told reporters that the disease was caught early and that he expected to make a full recovery . 
In January 2010 , Dodd announced he would not run for re-election in 2010 , and would retire at the end of his term . 
Dodd has a liberal voting record when it comes to social issues , though he is more moderate on economic policy . 
He voted with his party 95.5 percent of the time in the 110th Congress . 
Dodd has close ties to the banking and insurance industries , and he has been charged with catering to their needs at the cost of consumers . 
He has sponsored several anti-regulation measures , and was one of the leaders in crafting the $ 700 billion bailout package in fall 2008 . 
But the Democrat was also spearheading a drive for financial regulatory reform as a result of the 2008-2009 crisis that could end up being a major part of his legacy , if it is approved . 
When Dodd took over the Banking Committee in 2007 , he set a fairly populist agenda , hoping to increase funding for affordable housing , placing tighter restrictions on foreign investment in the economy and pushing keeping manufacturing jobs in America . 
Dodd worked with Sen. Mitch McConnell -LRB- R-Ky . -RRB- 
to pass a bill that set federal standards for election counts and authorized nearly $ 4 billion to carry the legislation out . 
He formed the first Children 's Caucus in the Senate , and helped pass the Family and Medical Leave Act , which requires companies to offer employees paid leave to tend to sick family members . 
Dodd has often been accused of pandering to the large number of hedge funds and financial institutions in Connecticut by opposing more stringent regulation on businesses . 
The top donors to his campaigns are banks , insurance companies , real estate offices and law firms . 
In 1998 , he was given a Golden Leash award from Public Campaign , a campaign finance reform advocacy group . 
The group said Dodd was chosen for the `` award , '' given to members with the largest connections to special interests , because of his fundraising base and his support of measures that would have reduced oversight of the financial sector . 
This summer , the Center for Responsive Politics reported that Dodd received the most money from Countrywide Financial of any senator and that he had been placed in their priority lending program called `` Friends of Angelo '' for receiving favorable terms on his home mortgage . 
Dodd had criticized Countrywide and other mortgage companies as the culprits in the sub-prime mortgage meltdown . 
Dodd acknowledged that he had accepted the favorable terms , though he said he thought it was because of his credit scores , and not his political position . 
But Dodd has also bucked his donors . 
He helped write the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 , which tightened regulations on the management of public companies . 
He has also taken credit card-companies to task for predatory lending practices . 
When Dodd was elevated to chair of the Senate Banking Committee in 2007 , one of his top goals was creating a new regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
He was critical of the Treasury Department 's decision to take over the two mortgage giants , charging that Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson acted too quickly without exploring lower-cost alternatives . 
But Dodd was also the top recipient of lobbying money from Fannie and Freddie , according to Open Secrets.org . 
Dodd was at the center of a firestorm of criticism in March 2009 over $ 450 million in bonuses legally required to be paid to members of AIG Financial Products , which is primarily headquartered in Dodd 's home state of Connecticut . 
The `` Dodd amendment '' to the February 2009 $ 787 economic billion stimulus package was designed to limit executive compensation , but permitted bonus payments to companies receiving federal bailout money before Feb. 11 , 2009 . 
Dodd said he does not know how that particular date made its way into the amendment . 
He is considering a plan to tax those bonuses at a prohibitively high rate . 
In March 2010 , Dodd unveiled his long-awaited version of financial regulation reform . 
The measure would increase the Federal Reserve 's oversight responsibilities . 
The proposal would centralize the Fed 's power in Washington , D.C. and New York , stripping much of the role played by the current regional Fed banks . 
The bill would allow for the orderly dissolution of big financial institutions whose destruction would threaten the entire U.S. economy at no cost to taxpayers ; for the first time , regulate the derivatives market that was blamed for helping to cause the 2008-2008 meltdown ; create a financial council overseen by the Treasury Department to coordinate and monitor risk in the financial markets ; create an independent consumer watchdog inside the Federal Reserve to give U.S. consumers clear information regarding financial products like credit cards and mortgages ; and imposes regulations on derivatives trading , requiring most of it to take place in open marketplaces . 
In summer 2009 , Dodd emerged as a player in the health-care reform debate when his ally , longtime health-reform advocate Sen. Edward M. Kennedy -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
, was sidelined by medical troubles . 
Kennedy passed away in August 2009 , but Dodd chose not to take over the chairmanship , choosing instead to remain chair of the banking committee . 
As a 2008 presidential candidate , he proposed a plan to offer all Americans health insurance that would be similar to the coverage federal employees receive . 
Kennedy chaired the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , one of the two committees working on a health-care bill in the Senate . 
But treatment for a brain cancer diagnosed the year before left Kennedy unable to attend key meetings on Capitol Hill . 
Before Kennedy 's death , Dodd chaired the mark-up for the health-reform bill , The Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 , and oversaw it 's approval by a vote of 13 to 10 along party lines . 
The bill was Kennedy 's baby , and called for progressive reforms including an option for Americans to purchase a public insurance plan , which ran into political trouble in summer 2009 . 
Kennedy said including a government plan in the marketplace would `` ensure that fiscal discipline and full accountabiliity are built into this new structure . '' 
In addition to the public option , the HELP Committee 's bill required that insurance companies offer coverage to all Americans , even if they have pre-existing conditions , and required all Americans to carry some form of health insurance . 
Businesses with more than 25 employees would be required to offer coverage to employees , and Americans could choose to compare and buy insurance on a national exchange . 
Kennedy 's death in August 2009 left Dodd as the presumptive heir to the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions chairmanship , but Dodd chose not to take over the chairmanship . 
Connecticut is a business state leery of lawsuits , and Dodd supported his constituents , trying to limit the power and the scope of trial attorneys . 
In 1995 , he successfully passed , and then successfully worked to override a Clinton veto , on a securities litigation bill that made it more difficult to file a federal securities class action lawsuit . 
He was the lead sponsor on a bill to limit product liability lawsuits , which was also vetoed by Clinton . 
Dodd was an early Iraq war supporter , arguing that if the United Nations would n't back their efforts , America would be justified in invading the country alone . 
He has since reversed his position , saying that if he knew Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction , he would not have supported the war . 
In 2007 , Dodd introduced legislation that would have capped troop levels in Iraq at their current level . 
Any increase would require Congressional approval . 
Dodd 's closest friend in the Senate is Sen. Edward M. Kennedy -LRB- D-Mass -RRB- . 
He also enjoys a congenial relationship with ranking Banking Committee member Richard Shelby -LRB- R-Ala . -RRB- . 
Dodd and former President Bill Clinton are long-time golfing buddies . 
Clinton tried to convince him to run for president in 2004 , but Dodd deferred to his colleague Joe Lieberman -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- . 
It was n't the first time he had been encouraged to run ; former Sen. Paul Simon -LRB- D-Ill . -RRB- 
tried to get Dodd into the race 20 years ago . 
Several Dodd staffers have gone on to prominent government positions . 
Debra Barrett , who advised Dodd on health-care policy , went on to serve as a government relations officer at TEVA pharmaceuticals and former chief of staff Ken Crerar has since taken a job with the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers . 
Dodd and Lieberman used to have a close relationship . 
Dodd lobbied hard to get Lieberman on the 2000 presidential ticket by convincing people like Jesse Jackson and National Education Association head Bob Chase that Lieberman was a good pick . 
But after Lieberman lost the Democratic nomination for Senate in the 2006 primary , Dodd endorsed winner Ned Lamont , even filming a commercial for him . 
He explained his defection this way : `` What do I tell someone who wants to be a Democrat and join the process : ` I 'm sorry , the primary does n't count ? ' '' 
This left slow-healing hurt feelings , and sources say their relationship is now chilly at best . 
But Dodd defended Lieberman when Reid and Senate Democrats demanded blood after Lieberman actively campaigned for GOP presidential nominee John McCain -LRB- R-Ariz . -RRB- 
Dodd said the state should n't be punished by throwing Lieberman from his chairmanship of the Senate Homeland Security Committee .

"Geithner Grilled on His Past , Path Forward Treasury secretary nominee Timothy F. Geithner said yesterday that the Obama administration would unveil a three-pronged strategy within weeks to aid financial firms , struggling homeowners and the consumer credit markets using the remaining $ 350 billion of the government 's financial rescue program . 
`` The ultimate costs of this crisis will be greater if we do not act with sufficient strength now , '' Geithner told the Senate Finance Committee during his confirmation hearing . 
`` In a crisis of this magnitude , the most prudent course is the most forceful course . '' 
He promised that the Obama administration would offer a `` clear plan '' but provided few specifics . 
Geithner , 47 , also faced tough questions about his role last year in devising federal bailouts for Wall Street 's biggest firms and his failure to pay all of his taxes on time between 2001 and 2004 . 
Geithner , who settled his outstanding taxes only after he was nominated to the Treasury post , said he signed his tax forms without reading them carefully . 
`` These were careless mistakes . 
They were avoidable mistakes , but they were unintentional . 
I should have been more careful , '' he said . 
He apologized to committee members for making them spend time on his personal history when the nation faced more pressing issues . 
Although lawmakers from both parties expressed misgivings about Geithner 's personal tax history -- pointedly noting that he would be overseeing the Internal Revenue Service as Treasury secretary -- they said they were even more concerned about the worsening financial crisis and viewed him as the right man for the job . 
Even key Republicans predicted that Geithner , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , is unlikely to encounter serious obstacles on his path to the Treasury Department , where he would serve as Obama 's top adviser on the financial crisis and manage a $ 700 billion financial rescue program . 
The Senate Finance Committee is set to vote on his nomination today . 
Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the committee 's ranking Republican , said that Geithner 's qualifications and role in carrying out the government 's financial rescue program `` gives him unique insight '' during a critical time in the crisis . 
Grassley said that `` to some he is n't merely the best choice , to some he is the only choice , '' but that his tax history would reflect poorly on a Treasury secretary . 
A full floor vote could happen as early as Friday , but any Republican in the Senate could hold up the nomination , leaving Stuart Levey , a Bush administration holdover who oversaw a terrorism finance enforcement division , in charge of the Treasury . 
If Geithner 's confirmation is delayed , Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid -LRB- D-Nev . -RRB- 
said yesterday that he would force cloture votes over the weekend . 
Aside from his tax history , lawmakers grilled Geithner on his strategy for the remaining financial rescue funds . 
Geithner said his department would aim to remove constraints that hinder small businesses , car buyers , students and municipalities from getting loans . 
The administration is also considering establishing a `` bad bank '' to buy toxic assets that are at the core of the financial crisis because they prevent banks from lending to each other , he said .

"Former Chair of the President 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board -LRB- January 2009-January 2011 -RRB- Volcker brought instant credibility to President Barack Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign . 
His weighty experience helped dispel the notion that Obama lacked the economic credentials to become chief executive during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . 
While he is not taking a full-time job in the administration , as chairman of an economic advisory committee , he will be a critical voice as Obama tries to forge a path out of the recession . 
Volcker left the committee in January 2011 and was replaced by GE Chairman Jeffrey Immelt . 
In a pivotal moment in the final 2008 presidential debate , Sen. John McCain -LRB- R-Ariz . -RRB- 
questioned the associates of the junior senator from Illinois , a persistent campaign theme . '' 
` Let me tell you who I associate with , ' Obama told McCain . 
` On economic policy , I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed chairman Paul Volcker . ' '' 
Volcker has a reputation for fairness and strong leadership during troubled times . 
When he became chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1979 , he faced the worst inflationary crisis America had seen in decades . 
He ended it by raising interest rates sharply , sparking the deepest downturn since the Great Depression . 
The interest-rate hikes are now widely viewed as a necessary step to end the cycle of soaring prices and stagflation that set in , but at the time the tactic was deeply controversial , as the unemployment rate climbed above 10 percent . 
Since being replaced by Alan Greenspan in 1987 , Volcker has become an eminence grise , lending independent credibility to a range of organizations . 
For example , he investigated alleged corruption in the United Nations Oil for Food Program in Iraq . 
He is also chairman of the Group of 30 , an assemblage of leading financial experts that seeks an overhaul of global financial regulations . 
In his later years , he 's still helping to shape the nation 's future economic policies , and was even discussed as an Obama Treasury secretary . 
Though he has taken an advisery position rather than a full-time job , `` When the team discusses the financial crisis , ` The most important question to Obama : What does Paul Volcker think ? ' 
says Jason Furman , the 2008 campaign 's economic-policy director . '' 
Career History : Chairman , Federal Reserve -LRB- 1979 to 1987 -RRB- ; Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs , Department of the Treasury -LRB- 1969 to 1974 -RRB- ; Deputy Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs , Department of the Treasury -LRB- 1963 to 1965 -RRB- Alma Mater : Princeton University , BA , 1949 ; Harvard University , MPA , 1951 Raised in Teaneck , N.J. , Volcker learned from an early age how government affects people . 
He learned this from his father , who worked as a city manager for the Jersey town , and even helped it escape a small financial crisis of its own . 
Volcker went to Princeton University , graduating summa cum laude before moving to Harvard to earn a master 's in public administration . 
The 6-foot-7-inch student found himself leaning towards work in government even back then . 
`` When I was in college and graduate school , at institutions thought to be among the elite , a career in the foreign service or in one of the great domestic departments and agencies was considered by many a natural professional objective , a means by which those able and interested in government expect over time to gain satisfaction and ultimately a reasonable measure of prestige from constructive public service , '' he said . 
While at Harvard , Volcker interned as a research assistant at the New York Fed . 
He stayed with the Fed after he graduated in 1952 , and worked his way up to special assistant in the securities department . 
He then moved to Chase Manhattan Bank as a financial economist . 
By 1962 , Volker was back in the public sector , working at the Treasury Department . 
He would return to the private sector for a few more years , but in 1969 became undersecretary to the Treasury for monetary affairs . 
After a brief stint as a professor at Princeton , President Carter named Volcker Fed Chairman in 1979 . 
Volcker 's first meeting with Obama came in June 2007 , when Obama was seen as a longshot to win the presidency . 
Volcker walked away from a dinner with the upstart Democrat , saying he was ` genuinely impressed . ' 
But no one in Obama 's campaign thought of asking for Volcker 's help . 
When Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee discovered Volcker 's comment , he quickly urged the team to get Volcker involved . 
`` Paul Volcker is a legend ! 
We do n't want to use his contacts for money , we want to pick his brain , '' Goolsbee said . 
Obama was soon speaking to him regularly for counsel on responding to the burgeoning crisis . 
Obama 's proclamation in September 2007 that the housing market downturn could cause a ` crisis in confidence ' in the financial markets originated with Volcker . 
Volcker at first disagreed with the notion that the U.S. needed an economic stimulus package , but recent events changed his mind . '' 
I 've gone through a number of crises , but I 've never seen one more complicated or difficult , '' he said . 
Volcker expressed some public skepticism of the Federal Reserve 's decision to put $ 29 billion at risk to arrange the sale of investment bank Bear Stearns in March 2008 . 
In an April speech , Volcker said that the Fed took actions that `` extend to the very edge of its lawful and implied powers , transcending in the process certain long-embedded central banking principles and practices . '' 
In January 2009 , Obama proposed new financial regulations that would attempt to prevent a future economic downturn while also solving the `` too-big-to-fail '' problem , which forced the government to interve and save collapsing banks . 
The new rule outlined would limit banks ' ability to invest in hedge funds and private equity funds . 
If approved by Congress , the rule would revive parts of the Glass-Steagall Act , repealed in 1999 , which separated corporate banks from investment banks . 
Dubbed the `` Volcker Rule , '' Obama 's proposal attempts to bring back similar limitations . 
In January 2009 , the Group of 30 economists and finance experts , chaired by Volcker , issued a report on a global financial regulatory overhaul . 
Among other steps , it called for preventing any one financial institution from becoming so large that its failure could bring down the entire financial system . 
It also calls for money-market mutual funds , which are similar to banks in many ways but are far less regulated , to be overseen more carefully . 
And the report calls on the U.S. government to clarify the legal status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government-sponsored housing finance companies that it took over in 2008 but whose relationship with the government has historically been ambiguous . 
Because of Volcker 's closeness to Obama , it is widely believed that many of the ideas in the report will be embraced by the new administration . 
Volcker has been around Washington since the 1950s and has amassed an historic reputation . 
Although shy , he has built a career that had direct dealings with Presidents Carter and Reagan . 
He went on fishing trips with Gerald Corrigan , ex-CEO of the Federal Reserve and managing director at Goldman Sachs .

"Prescient Young Blogger Did What S. Korea Could n't -- Foresee Global Financial Crisis As a financial blogger named Minerva , Park Dae-sung was the dark prophet of market decline in South Korea . 
In this education-obsessed country , where academic credentials are often taken as a measure of human value , he was also something of an idiot savant . 
He had no degree in economics . 
He had no professional experience in finance . 
He was not a wealthy investor . 
He had been a so-so student who studied communications at a so-so junior college in a backwater town south of Seoul . 
Thirty-one years old and single , he spent much of his time alone in his room . 
As his father noted , `` He ca n't even get a job . '' 
But he knew a global economic smack-down when he saw one . 
Minerva saw it coming last fall , far earlier and with far more acuity than the South Korean government , which his blog has humiliated and angered . 
Besides getting mad , the government got even . 
In a move widely perceived by the public as a chilling echo of the 1970s , when a military dictatorship ruled South Korea , the government detained Park this month , invoking a seldom-used telecommunications law that charges him with harming the public by spreading `` false rumors . '' 
Yet Minerva -LRB- no one knew him as Park until police raided his house Jan. 7 -RRB- made his reputation by spreading rumors that turned out to be all too true . 
He predicted the collapse of Lehman Brothers five days before it happened . 
He predicted a sharp decline in the value of South Korea 's currency a few days before the won imploded against the dollar . 
By the time he was taken away from his computer in handcuffs , he was a cyber-sensation . 
His blog had garnered more than 40 million page views -LRB- there are 48 million people in this well-wired country -RRB- . 
He was lionized in the South Korean news media as the `` online oracle '' and the `` Internet president of the economy . '' 
Although Park has told authorities he is Minerva , claims have emerged here that Minerva might be a few people . 
Several economic and financial experts have said they wrote online postings under the name . 
Prosecutors , though , have declined to investigate , saying they have irrefutable electronic evidence that Minerva is Park .

"At his confirmation hearings last week , Tim Geithner branded China a currency manipulator . 
This is a designation that the Bush Treasury Department never formally affixed to the Chinese . 
It may signal a nerve-racking shift in how the United States manages its most pivotal relationship . 
Geithner is correct that China manipulates its currency . 
What 's more , this manipulation is arguably the most important cause of the financial crisis . 
Starting around the middle of this decade , China 's cheap currency led it to run a massive trade surplus . 
The earnings from that surplus poured into the United States . 
The result was the mortgage bubble . 
China 's leaders protest that they are being unfairly scapegoated . 
Yet while there are rival accounts of the origins of the crisis , neither has the explanatory force of the blame-China narrative . 
The first rival account is that the crisis reflected failings of U.S. financial regulation . 
Such failings exist , but most have been around for years . 
The mortgage bubble reached its craziest extremes in 2005-07 , when China was flooding the world with cheap capital . 
Moreover , regulatory failings exist not just at one regulator but many . 
The Securities and Exchange Commission failed to check risks at broker-dealers such as Bear Stearns . 
State insurance regulators failed to prevent the collapse of AIG . 
The Federal Reserve failed to see that banks were pouring capital into toxic securities that they then held off their balance sheets . 
European regulators were no better , even though they had adopted a supposedly more up-to-date set of capital standards . 
The lesson : Faced with a deluge of cheap money , no regulatory regime can be expected to prevent bubbles . 
The second rival account of the crisis accepts that its origins lie less in regulatory failings than in economic pressures . 
But it blames the bubble on two mistakes at home rather than on the glut of capital from China . 
Americans should have controlled the urge to splurge , the thinking goes , and borrowed less Chinese money . 
And the Fed should have shut down the easy-money party by raising interest rates . 
If Americans ' insatiable appetite for loans explained the flood of Chinese capital into the United States , we would have seen the evidence in a rising price for those loans -- that is , higher interest rates in the bond market . 
But bond rates were strikingly low at mid-decade . 
This strongly suggests that it was the supply of lending that went up , not the demand for it . 
Chinese money flooded into the United States because of the push factor from China , not the pull factor from Americans . 
Could the Fed have raised interest rates to avert the bubble ? 
The Fed 's monetary policy was indeed too loose . 
But as Martin Wolf argues in his recent book , `` Fixing Global Finance , '' it 's not clear that higher interest rates could have prevented the trouble . 
Once China decides to export vast quantities of capital , that capital has to go somewhere . 
Higher interest rates in the United States might have encouraged the world 's savers to park even more of their capital in this country . 
So there is no getting around China 's culpability . 
The country relies on the sort of export-focused growth strategy that other Asian Tigers have pursued , with the difference that China is too big to go this route without destabilizing the world economy . 
The real question is whether it is diplomatically fruitful to push China to change . 
The Bush administration tried and failed . 
Why would the new team fare better ? 
The wrong answer is to say that Barack Obama 's guys will be tougher . 
However egregious China 's currency policy may be , it 's counterproductive to punish Beijing with sanctions . 
For one thing , a trade war is the last thing the world economy needs . 
For another , as Geithner explained , the immediate priority is to get global growth going , so it 's more important to persuade China to extend its fiscal stimulus than to revalue its currency . 
Besides , reforming China 's exchange-rate policy is not the only way to wean the country off its high-savings , high-export model . 
The savings rate partly reflects China 's lack of social safety nets . 
If the Chinese spend some of their stimulus on pensions and health care , they will be heading in the right direction . 
Still , there is an opportunity to nudge China toward currency reform , and the Obama team should take it . 
China 's leaders are not fools : They can see the effects of their policy not only in collapsing Wall Street banks but also in their own collapsing exports . 
The bubble that China inflated has brought China 's foreign customers to their knees . 
Because China pushed its export model too aggressively , its export markets have cratered . 
Think of it this way : China 's position is akin to that of OPEC in the early 1980s . 
Two oil shocks taught oil producers the limits to their power : When they jammed prices up , the world economy sputtered and motorists bought smaller cars -- and oil prices fell precipitously . 
OPEC learned to balance its lust for higher oil prices with the fear that customers might revolt . 
China 's leaders may be ready for the same lesson -- and Geithner 's words may encourage them to learn it .

"'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | Global Financial Crisis Fuels Political Unrest in Eastern Europe and Iceland Latvians gathered in Riga 's Old Town this month to peacefully protest their government 's handling of the economic crisis . 
Afterward , a riot erupted . 
-LRB- By Roman Koksarov -- Associated Press -RRB- RIGA , Latvia -- On a frigid evening this month , more than 10,000 people gathered outside a 13th-century cathedral in this Baltic capital to protest the government 's handling of Latvia 's economic crisis and demand early elections . 
The demonstration was one of the largest here since the mass rallies against Soviet rule in the late 1980s , and a sign of both the public 's frustration and its faith in the political system . 
But at the end of the night , as the crowd dispersed , the protest turned into a riot . 
Hundreds of angry young people , many drunk and recently unemployed , rampaged through the historic Old Town , smashing shop windows , throwing rocks and eggs at police , even prying cobblestones from the streets to lob at the Parliament building . 
Similar outbursts of civil unrest have occurred in recent weeks across the periphery of Europe , where the global financial crisis has buffeted smaller countries with fewer resources to defend their economies . 
Especially in Eastern Europe , the turmoil reflects surging political discontent and threatens to topple shaky governments that have been the focus of popular resentment over corruption for years . 
Europeans have compared the unrest to events of the 1960s and even the 1930s , when the Great Depression fueled political upheaval across the continent and gave rise to isolationism and fascism . 
But no ideology has tapped into public anger and challenged the basic dominance of free-market economics and democratic politics in these countries . 
Instead , protesters appear united primarily by dashed economic hopes and hostility against the ruling authorities . 
`` The politicians never think about the country , about the ordinary people , '' said Nikolai Tikhomirov , 23 , an electronics salesman who participated in the Jan. 13 protest in Riga . 
`` They only think of themselves . '' 
Days after the riot , a demonstration by 7,000 protesters in neighboring Lithuania turned violent , leading police to respond with rubber bullets . 
Fifteen people were injured . 
Smaller protests and clashes have erupted in Bulgaria , the Czech Republic and Hungary , following weeks of street violence in Greece last month . 
On Thursday , police in Iceland used tear gas for the first time in half a century to disperse a crowd of 2,000 protesting outside Parliament in Reykjavik . 
The next day , Prime Minister Geir Haarde agreed to call early elections and said he would step down . 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn , head of the International Monetary Fund , said the financial crisis could cause further turmoil `` almost everywhere , '' listing Latvia , Hungary , Belarus and Ukraine as among the most vulnerable nations . 
`` It may worsen in the coming months , '' he told the BBC . 
`` The situation is really , really serious . '' 
There is particular concern about the relatively young and sometimes dysfunctional democracies that emerged after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe , where societies that endured severe hardship in the 1990s in the hope that capitalism and integration with the West would bring prosperity now face further pain . 
`` The political systems in all these countries are fragile , '' said Jonathan Eyal , director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute , a research group in London . 
`` There 's a long history of unfulfilled promises and frustration with the political elites going back to the Communist era . '' 
Eyal warned of a revival of ethnic conflict in the region , where most countries have large minority populations , adding that tensions could rise after workers who have lost jobs in Western Europe return home . 
But he noted that extreme nationalist movements have won only limited support in Eastern Europe in recent years . 
`` People here instinctively know the idea of a strongman who imposes order does n't work , '' he said , arguing that the region 's history with Communist rule , its integration with the European Union and its anxiety about Russia 's intentions make a turn toward authoritarianism unlikely . 
`` They have seen the past , and a return to previous populist schemes is n't very persuasive . 
At the end of the day , they know there 's no alternative to the market economy . '' 
That assessment rings true in Latvia , where the government 's approval ratings have fallen as low as 10 percent -- the worst in the European Union , and lower than at any other time in the nation 's post-Soviet history -- but where people scoff when asked if they want to abandon markets and political freedoms .

"At the start of the Obama administration , Geithner tackled one of the most immense challenges ever to face an economic policymaker : pulling the U.S. economy out of the deepest recession in at least a generation and rescuing a financial system that was in utter disarray . 
As such , he became a punching bag for criticism of the aggressive Obama strategy to rescue the economy , with some critics even demanding his resignation . 
But at the start of 2011 , the economy disaster was averted and many of Obama 's top economic hands had departed while Geither , ironically , remained . 
As Treasury secretary , Geithner allocated the remaining $ 350 billion of the giant financial rescue package known as TARP green-lighted by Congress just days before Obama 's inauguration . 
He decided which banks and other financial companies to rescue and which to ignore and what conditions the government would attach to the rescue money . 
Geithner also played a significant role in shaping the administration 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , enacted in February 2009 . 
And he played a lead role in shaping the Dodd-Frank the July 2010 financial regulation overhaul package . 
As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2003 to 2009 , Geithner was one of the lead architects of the government response to the 2008-2009 crisis . 
It was his decision , along with those of Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , to bail out Bear Stearns in March 2008 , to let Lehman Brothers fail in September of that year , and for the government to take over insurance company American International Group . 
Before any of that , Geithner was a top Treasury Department official in the Clinton years , dealing with the international financial crises of 1995 to 1998 . 
He was a protege of Clinton administration Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and , especially , Larry Summers . 
Summers was the other leading candidate to be Obama 's Treasury secretary and instead served as a top White House economic adviser . 
After a flap about delinquent tax payments , the Senate confirmed Geithner , 60 to 34 , on Jan. 26 , 2009 . 
Amid all the gloom-and-doom , there was one piece of lighthearted news for the fledgling secretary in April 2009 when he was named to People 's annual list of the `` 100 Most Beautiful People . '' 
News From Around The Web WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says the government has begun borrowing from the federal employee pension fund to keep operating without surpassing its debt limit . 
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is telling congressional leaders that the U.S. government will exhaust its borrowing limit as soon as mid-February , earlier than expected . 
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is telling congressional leaders that the U.S. government will exhaust its borrowing limit as soon as mid-February , earlier than expected . 
News From Around The Web WASHINGTON -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar will leave the Obama administration in March , an Obama administration official said Wednesday . 
Career History : President and CEO , Federal Reserve Bank of New York ; Vice Chairman , Federal Open Market Committee -LRB- Nov. 2003 to Jan. 2009 -RRB- ; Director , Policy Development and Review , International Monetary Fund -LRB- Sept. 2001 to Nov. 2003 -RRB- Alma Mater : Dartmouth College , Bachelor 's Degree , 1983 ; Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , Master 's , 1985 Geithner was born in New York City in 1961 , but he spent most of his youth abroad , living with his family in a variety of countries including India , Thailand , and what is now Zimbabwe . 
His nomadic childhood inspired an interest in language and culture . 
An amateur photographer , his travels allowed him to capture unique subjects . 
While living in Thailand , he took photographs of refugees and `` turned our bathroom in Bangkok into a darkroom , '' his mother has said . 
Geithner went from Dartmouth to the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , where he received a master 's in international economics and East Asian studies in 1985 . 
Geithner was then hired at Kissinger Associates , the prominent international and business consulting firm founded by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger . 
In 1988 , Geithner joined the Treasury Department as a career civil servant , working on issues involving Japan as a special assistant to an undersecretary . 
He worked there through the George H.W. Bush administration and into the Clinton years , when then-Under Secretary Summers was deeply impressed by the young staffer who had the same intellectual intensity as Summers . 
But Geithner had a more affable manner than the often brusque Harvard economist . 
`` In Geithner , Summers recognized the perfect complement , '' The New Republic reported . 
Indeed , Geithner was one of the few officials who had the brains and self-confidence to stand up to Summers in internal debates . 
`` He 's the only guy that would walk in and say , ` on this one , Larry , you 're full of it , ' '' Summers said . 
Summers promoted Geithner to be a deputy assistant secretary in 1994 , and later to assistant secretary and then under secretary for international affairs . 
In those jobs , Geithner helped manage the Treasury 's response to the Meixcan peso crisis in 1995 , the East Asian crises of 1997-1998 , and the Russian debt default in 1998 and near-collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management . 
Geithner was the first career civil servant to serve as a Treasury under secretary . 
At the end of the Clinton administration , Geithner moved to the International Monetary Fund , where he was director of policy development . 
That period led to a blot on his personal record . 
The IMF does n't pay the employer match on Social Security and Medicare taxes , meaning Geithner was responsible for paying those taxes himself . 
He did n't do so , however , until he was audited in 2005 , and even then only paid the back taxes for 2003 and 2004 . 
Geithner did n't pay the back taxes for 2001 and 2002 until after Obama tapped him to be Treasury secretary at the end of 2008 . 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York In 2003 , after a long search , Geithner was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . 
In that job , he was the Fed 's eyes and ears on Wall Street , the primary regulator of some of the largest U.S. banks , and one of its lead crisis managers . 
In the years before the financial crisis began in 2007 , Geithner delivered many speeches discussing weaknesses in the financial regulatory system , especially frailties in the market for credit default swaps and other over-the-counter derivatives . 
Those warnings turned out to be prescient , as those markets contributed to the deep crisis underway . 
However , Geithner 's speeches often argued that as a whole the financial system was becoming more stable , and he did not take aggressive action to rein in the risk-taking of Wall Street firms . 
In August 2008 , financial markets began a wrenching crisis as losses mounted on securities tied to subprime mortgage loans . 
The crisis had spread to all types of credit products , with transactions freezing up , financial instiutions incurring huge losses and lending drying up throughout the economy . 
As chairman of the New York Fed , Geithner was a lead architect of the government 's response , including a campaign of interest rate cuts starting in September 2007 that pushed the federal funds rate to near zero by December 2008 . 
In internal Fed debates , Geithner reliably pushed for more active intervention to guard the economy than did some of his colleagues further from Wall Street . 
He negotiated the deal to sell failed investment bank Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan Chase in March 2008 , ultimately putting $ 29 billion of Fed assets at risk to get the deal done . 
Six months later , when Lehman Brothers was on the verge of failure , Geithner was more open to saving it than Bush Treasury Secretary Paulson , but Paulson 's hardline position prevailed and it went under . 
Just days later , Geithner engineered the takeover of AIG , the single largest of the government bailouts so far . 
In February 2009 , Geithner announced his first initiative in stabilizing the financial system . 
Called the Financial Stability Plan , Geithner outlined what he would do with the $ 350 billion remaining from the TARP fund , including direct capital injections to banks . 
But Geithner went much further than his predecessor . 
He announced an initial $ 250 billion to $ 500 billion `` bad bank '' program that would be a joint effort between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to buy toxic assets that banks were n't able to sell . 
Also included was up to $ 1 trillion in financing for consumers and student loans , including for small businesses , car payments and tuition . 
Geithner fought hard for these initiatives , as the New York Times reported that many in the administration , including Obama senior adviser David Axelrod , wanted tougher restrictions on executive pay and how banks spend taxpayer money . 
But the final copy of the plan had Geithner 's fingerprints all over it . 
In May 2009 , the administration released the results of stress tests that financial regulators , including the Fed , FDIC and Treasury 's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , performed on struggling banks that were deemed `` too big to fail . '' 
The tests were designed to measure what the banks needed , in terms of capital , to withstand a prolonged recession . 
For three months , regulators examined the bank 's financials , deciding how each company would react if the economy worsened , jobless rates rose and home prices continued to fall . 
Many analysts predicted the banks would need to raise more than $ 100 billion in capital , to pass these tests . 
But when the Treasury announced the final figures , many of the banks fared much better than expected . 
Ten of the 19 banks would need to increase their capital holdings by $ 75 billion dollars , collectively . 
Bank of America needed to raise the most capital at nearly $ 34 billion . 
With the stress tests showing an overall positive outlook for the financial system , banks with sufficient capital could start paying back TARP funds . 
`` With this support , and with the clarity provided by today 's announcement , banks should be able to get back to the business of banking , '' said Geithner when releasing the results of the stress tests . 
Two weeks after the results of the stress tests were announced , Geithner testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee . 
He announced that the 10 banks that needed to increase capital had raised or announced plans to raise over $ 48 billion . 
Geithner said in his written statement to the committee that `` there are important indications that our financial system is starting to heal . '' 
Geithner took a lead role in revamping financial regulation , which was shepherded through Congress by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- 
and Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- . 
It was enacted in July 2010 . 
The bill would allow for the orderly dissolution of big financial institutions whose destruction would threaten the entire U.S. economy at no cost to taxpayers ; for the first time , regulate the derivatives market that was blamed for helping to cause the 2008-2008 meltdown ; create a financial council overseen by the Treasury Department to coordinate and monitor risk in the financial markets ; create an independent consumer watchdog inside the Federal Reserve to give U.S. consumers clear information regarding financial products like credit cards and mortgages ; and imposes regulations on derivatives trading , requiring most of it to take place in open marketplaces . 
In written 2009 remarks to the Senate Finance Committee , Geithner signaled a more aggressive approach to negotiating trade policies with China . 
The Chinese government artificially deflates its currency , the renmibi or yuan , which leads to cheap exports . 
Ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao 's January 2011 state visit to the U.S. , Geithner delivered a speech arguing that China must move more aggressively to increase the value of the yuan , as well as address intellectual-property theft . 
`` We believe it is in China 's interest to allow the currency to appreciate more rapidly in response to market forces . 
And we believe China will do so because the alternative will be too costly - both for China and for China 's relations with the rest of the world , '' Geithner said . 
In 2010 , the House approved a special tax to offset what lawmakers believed was China 's `` currency manipulation , '' although the Senate did n't vote on the issue . 
Geithner has spent more years in public service than many of the former Street veterans he works with , but his connections tie him to the slew of Goldman Sachs alumni that have recently populated the Treasury Department , including Rubin and former Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , both former Goldman chairmen . 
It was Rubin who gave a young Geithner his shot at bigger things at the Treasury , and the New York Times says Geithner ` slack of work experience in the financial sector , `` has left him reliant on Wall Street chiefs to guide his thinking and that Goldman alumni have figured prominently in his ascent . '' 
Geithner is also a member of the Group of 30 , a nonprofit that brings together thirty of the most influential people from the public and private sectors . 
Members include Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman , and Larry Summers , a former high-profile Obama economic adviser . 
Geithner spent six months of 2001 as a senior fellow on the Council on Foreign Relations and is still a member of its advisory board , along with Stephen Friedman and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright .

"We all want President Obama to succeed in reviving the economy , but that should n't obscure the long odds he faces . 
We need to recognize that we 're grappling with three crises that , though interwoven , are also quite distinct . 
The solution to any one of them wo n't automatically resuscitate the larger economy if the others remain untreated and unchanged . 
First : the collapse of consumer spending . 
American consumers represent 70 percent of the economy . 
Traumatized by plunging home values and stock prices -- which have shaved at least $ 7 trillion from personal wealth -- they 've curbed spending and increased saving . 
That 's led directly to layoffs . 
In December , vehicle sales were down 36 percent from levels a year earlier . 
Second : the financial crisis . 
Lower lending deprives the economy of the credit to finance businesses , homes and costly consumer purchases -LRB- cars , appliances -RRB- . 
The deepest cuts involve `` securitization '' -- the sale of bonds . 
Investors have gone on strike . 
In 2008 , the issuance of bonds backing credit card loans fell 41 percent and those backing car loans 51 percent . 
Third : a trade crisis . 
Global spending and saving patterns are badly askew . 
High-saving Asian countries have relied on export-led growth that , in turn , has required American consumers to spend ever-larger shares of their incomes . 
Huge trade imbalances have resulted : U.S. deficits , Asian surpluses . 
As Americans cut spending , this pattern is no longer sustainable . 
Asia is tumbling into recession . 
Overcoming any of these crises alone would be daunting . 
Together , they 're the economic equivalent of a combined Ironman triathlon and Tour de France . 
The proposed remedy is the `` economic stimulus '' plan . 
If government does n't offset declines in consumer and other private spending , the economy might spiral down for several years . 
Last week , House committees considered an $ 825 billion package , split between $ 550 billion in additional spending and $ 275 billion in tax cuts . 
But in practice , the stimulus could disappoint . 
Parts of the House package look like a giant political slush fund , with money sprinkled to dozens of programs . 
There 's $ 50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts , $ 200 million for the Teacher Incentive Fund and $ 15.6 billion for increased Pell Grants to college students . 
Some of these proposals , whatever their other merits , wo n't produce many new jobs . 
Another problem : Construction spending -- for schools , clinics , roads -- may start so slowly that there will be little immediate economic boost . 
The Congressional Budget Office examined $ 356 billion in spending proposals and concluded that only 7 percent would be spent in 2009 and 31 percent in 2010 . 
Assume , however , that the stimulus is a smashing success . 
It cushions the recession . 
Unemployment -LRB- now : 7.2 percent -RRB- stops rising at , say , 8 percent instead of 10 percent . 
Still , a temporary stimulus ca n't fuel a permanent recovery . 
That requires a strong financial system to supply an expanding economy 's credit needs . 
How we get that is n't clear . 
The pillars of a successful financial system -- the ability to assess risk ; adequate capital to absorb losses ; and trust among banks , investors and traders -- have crumbled . 
Underlying these ills has been the consistent underestimation of losses . 
Economists at Goldman Sachs now believe that worldwide losses on mortgages , bonds , and loans to consumers and businesses total $ 2.1 trillion . 
In March , the Goldman estimate was about half that . 
All the new credit programs -- the Treasury 's Troubled Asset Relief Program -LRB- TARP -RRB- and various Federal Reserve lending facilities -- aim to counteract these problems by providing government money and government guarantees . 
Obama probably will expand these efforts , despite some obvious problems : If government oversight becomes too intrusive or punitive , it might deter much-needed infusions of private capital into banks . 
Again , let 's assume Obama 's policies succeed . 
Even then , we have no assurance of a vigorous recovery because the economic crisis is ultimately global in scope . 
The old trading patterns simply wo n't work anymore . 
If China and other Asian nations try to export their way out of trouble , they 're likely to be disappointed . 
Any import surge into the United States would weaken an incipient American recovery and probably trigger a protectionist reaction . 
Down that path lies tit-for-tat economic nationalism that might harm everyone . 
Indeed , if the rest of the world does n't buy more from America , any U.S. recovery may be feeble . 
What 's needed are policies that correct the imbalances in spending and saving . 
As Americans save more of their incomes , Asians should save less and spend more , so that they rely more on producing for themselves rather than exporting to us . 
The great trade discrepancies would shrink . 
But this sort of transformation would require basic political changes in Asia . 
Whether China and other Asian societies can make those changes is unclear . 
The implications are sobering . 
The success of Obama 's policies lies , to a large extent , outside his hands .

"My friend and I sit on the sofa and catch up after the holidays . 
We are two healthy , 60-something women ; we talk about our children and grandchildren , we share our dreams . 
And then I say : `` I think more about death now . '' 
`` You , too ? '' 
she replies , at first surprised and then reassured . 
`` I think about it all the time . '' 
Not just because we 're aging . 
It 's because of the toxic economy . 
Like many Americans , we are suffering from a strain of financial illness that targets older men and women . 
We are too old to start over and rebuild a nest egg ; we are too young to depend on what is left in our retirement savings to sustain us for the nearly 30 years that statisticians estimate we are likely to live . 
As a result , a dark angst spreads among us . 
My friend tells me about her sister , who went to the doctor for a repeat mammogram because she had a suspicious lump : She was half hoping for a cancer diagnosis so she could say to herself , Finally it will be over . 
What a dangerous mind game of desperation ! 
The lump proved benign . 
The woman has moved on . 
But the global epidemic of financial illness has prompted a common complaint : I can not afford to live too long . 
I can not afford to live out my normal life expectancy . 
This is crazy , given that older people are healthier and more active and have more options than in previous generations . 
My friend and I ought to be really excited about being longevity pioneers . 
But we 're not dancing . 
At the annual meeting of the Gerontological Society of America a few months ago , the title of a symposium warned : `` New Economic Woes Hit Boomers , Seniors Hardest . '' 
More recently , a conference at the International Longevity Center in New York explored the `` Impact of Economic Crisis on Older Adults . '' 
There is an effective treatment , the experts agree : Keep working , put off `` retirement . '' 
If unemployed , get a new job . 
But that 's like telling a patient there is a cure but it 's probably out of reach . 
In the current crisis , there are few jobs for anyone , and even fewer for older people . 
`` We 're seeing an increase -LRB- in unemployment -RRB- at older ages , '' Richard W. Johnson of the Urban Institute said at the Gerontological Society meeting . 
Studies also show that older men and women take longer to find a new job and usually face a substantial pay cut . 
One reason is ageism . 
The plight of the older worker was dire even before this meltdown . 
In 2006 , a 62-year-old man in Ohio chose an unorthodox financial plan : He robbed a bank , waited for the police to arrest him , then asked the judge for a three-year prison term -LRB- a wish that was granted -RRB- because he had n't been able to find a real job with benefits in several years and he could no longer support himself on the outside . 
`` There is age discrimination out there , '' Timothy J. Bowers told the judge , according to news reports .

"'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | LONDON , Jan. 26 -- Iceland 's coalition government collapsed Monday , the first government to fall as a direct result of the global economic turmoil . 
Prime Minister Geir Haarde said he and his cabinet would resign immediately . 
As personal savings have been wiped out and joblessness has soared , Icelanders -- once among the world 's wealthiest people -- have taken to the streets in protest , banging pots and pans and throwing eggs and toilet paper at Haarde and other parliamentary leaders . 
Protests have mounted throughout Europe , where the political backlash to the crisis is growing . 
In Ireland , Britain , Spain and other countries where bankruptcies and home foreclosures are rising , polls show that approval ratings of leaders are sinking . 
In Eastern Europe and Greece , where there is less of a government safety net , protesters have spilled onto the streets by the thousands . 
Last month 's collapse of the Belgian government , which had been wrestling with long-standing conflicts , was also hastened by the banking crisis , analysts said . 
Perhaps nowhere has the economic crash been more spectacular than Iceland , an island with 300,000 residents on the edge of the Arctic Circle . 
Last fall , its largest banks went bust and the value of its currency plummeted . 
In recent days , protests intensified as no leader took responsibility for the crash , prompting police to use tear gas for the first time in half a century . 
People felt that the government was `` playing the violin while the Titanic was sinking , '' best-selling Icelandic author Andri Sn r Magnason said in a telephone interview from Reykjavik , the capital . 
`` Everybody who has a loan is paying 20 percent interest , '' and even those who own modest homes find their salaries can not cover what is owed , he said . 
Haarde announced Friday that he would call early elections and said he would step down . 
He cited health reasons and said doctors were treating him for cancer . 
But ahead of those planned elections , Haarde 's Independence Party could not come to terms with the Social Democrats , its main partner in the two-year-old coalition that was scheduled to stay in power until 2011 . 
The Social Democrats have called for the firing of the central bank governor and for closer ties with the rest of Europe . 
The nation had purposefully sought to stay outside the European Union but now many believe that if Iceland had the euro as its currency instead of the krona , this crisis would not be so severe . 
Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Gisladottir , head of the Social Democratic Alliance party , is expected to start talks immediately with smaller parties in an attempt to form a new government that would rule until the new election . 
She has been receiving treatment for a brain tumor and said she does not want to be prime minister . 
`` Iceland is certainly leading the way of the social protests and the political fallouts , '' said Simon Johnson , former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington . 
`` I think it 's going to spread ; we 're in a phase now we 're beginning to see all the political fallout . '' 
Simon Tilford , chief economist at the Center for European Reform , said the severity of the economic downturn in Britain has `` ended any chance '' that Gordon Brown 's Labor government will be reelected when he calls elections sometime before mid-2010 . 
Iceland 's economy is forecast to shrink by almost 10 percent this year . 
Its banks , which had expanded into global powerhouses , had embraced risky investments that far exceeded the reserves of the nation 's central bank . 
The country was forced to accept a bailout from the IMF . 
Staff writer Anthony Faiola in Washington and special correspondent Karla Adam in London contributed to this report . ''

"From oil drillers that have closed down rigs to retailers that have liquidated stores , companies across America are reshaping themselves with breathtaking speed to adjust to the rapidly spreading financial crisis . 
Biotech firms are slashing research budgets to conserve cash . 
Trucking companies are outfitting vehicles with speed governors and installing onboard driver monitors to conserve fuel . 
Companies that can afford it are scooping up competitors to enhance their own prospects . 
Pfizer , the world 's largest drugmaker , helped stir up the mergers and acquisitions market yesterday with a deal to purchase rival Wyeth for $ 68 billion in cash , stock and debt . 
Analysts said that while Pfizer 's pursuit of an acquisition was tied less to the economy than it was to the company 's need to fill a stagnant drug pipeline with promising new medicines , the downturn did play a role in its announcement that it would cut 8,000 jobs . 
But for many companies the financial crisis is playing a major role in how they operate , prompting changes in business models or partnerships that never would have been considered in flusher times . 
`` We think what 's happening now is the entire system is hitting the brakes very rapidly , '' said Chuck Mulloy , a spokesman for Intel , the computer chipmaker that is shuttering its last manufacturing plant in Silicon Valley and cutting more than 5,000 jobs worldwide . 
Like others , Intel was caught off guard by a rapid deterioration in business . 
In mid-October , the company forecast fourth-quarter sales of $ 10.3 billion . 
Within 10 weeks , more than $ 2 billion of the anticipated revenue had vanished , with actual sales coming in at $ 8.2 billion . 
`` Demand just fell off the cliff -- unprecedented in the 40-year history of this company , '' Mulloy said . 
A falloff of a similar magnitude has hit the oil and gas industry , where drillers are pulling out of the Barnett Shale in Texas and other exploration areas that had been booming just months ago . 
A sharp drop in oil and gas prices has precipitated the decline . 
`` We 've seen a cascade of rig-count declines beginning in December and accelerating here , '' said Richard Mason , publisher of the Land Rig Newsletter , which estimates that the number of oil and gas rigs has fallen by a third from their peak in October . 
That translates into a loss of 700 rigs and 14,000 jobs . 
`` Exploration and production companies are acting a whole lot like consumers . 
That is , they 're not spending anything at the moment until they get a little more clarity as to how this will all evolve , '' Mason said . 
`` The irony is the industry had been scrambling to add people for nearly half a decade , and all of a sudden , after they put them to work , the market collapses . '' 
There was less of a boom-bust cycle at Expo , the chain of home furnishing showrooms owned by Home Depot . 
Expo had never been a big success , but the company held onto it for years -- until now . 
`` The Expo business has not performed well financially and is not expected to anytime soon . 
Even during the recent housing boom , it was not a strong business , '' Home Depot said in a statement yesterday announcing that it would close the 34-store chain over the next two months . 
`` Continuing this business would divert focus and resources '' from Home Depot 's namesake stores , the retailer said . 
The shutdown follows bankruptcy filings by several regional department stores and the liquidation underway at Circuit City .

"A congressional panel overseeing the government 's financial bailout has concluded that the economic crisis could have been prevented with better regulation and called for a raft of proposals to overhaul government oversight of the financial sector . 
`` The current crisis should come as no surprise , '' the panel wrote in a draft of the report , which is scheduled to be released today . 
`` The present regulatory system has failed to effectively manage risk , require sufficient transparency , and ensure fair dealings . '' 
The group urged creating a regulator with the authority to oversee financial firms whose failure poses a risk to the overall financial system . 
The panel also called for further regulation of the mortgage industry , hedge funds and derivatives , as well as limits on excessive borrowing by financial institutions . 
The recommendations came from the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Assets Relief Program -- the formal name of the $ 700 billion government bailout -- with the five members splitting on partisan lines . 
The three members appointed by Democratic lawmakers , including its chairman , Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren , voted to approve the report , while the two Republicans voted against it , according to a spokesman for the panel . 
The Republicans plan to release a separate dissenting report , which says that some of the majority 's recommendations are `` rife with moral hazard and the potential for unintended consequences '' and that others might be `` impossible to implement outside the walls of academia . '' 
`` Before embracing more government regulation as the only answer , such advocates should consider the many ways in which government regulation itself can be part of the problem , '' the Republican report said . 
In the majority report , the panel attributes the faulty regulation to the success of programs put in place after the Great Depression . 
Before , the United States suffered a major economic crisis roughly every 15 to 20 years , as far back as the panic of 1792 . 
But post-Depression regulations were so successful , the report concluded , soon `` a financial crisis was seen as a ghost of the past . '' 
`` After fifty years without a financial crisis -- the longest such stretch in the nation 's history -- financial firms and policy makers began to see regulation as a barrier to efficient functioning of the capital markets rather than a necessary precondition for success , '' the report said .

"In his interview with NBC 's Matt Lauer that aired this morning , Barack Obama acknowledged that he 'll be a one-term president if the stimulus does n't work . 
Lauer : '' -LRB- A -RRB- t some point will you say , ` Wait a minute , we 've spent this amount of money . 
We 're not seeing the results . 
We 've got to change course dramatically ? '' 
Obama : `` Look , I 'm at the start of my administration . 
One nice thing about -- the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable . 
You know , I 've got four years . 
And ... you know , a year from now I think people -- are gonna see that -- we 're starting to make some progress . 
But there 's still gonna be some pain out there . 
If I do n't have this done in three years then there 's gonna be a one-term proposition . '' 
Paul Kane writes in The Washington Post : `` The Senate will open debate today on a nearly $ 900 billion economic stimulus plan that is similar in size and scope to the package the House passed , creating a possibly smooth path for sending a bill to President Obama 's desk by the mid-February deadline . 
`` But senators in both parties hope to alter the legislation , focusing on easing the housing crisis , increasing infrastructure spending and cutting taxes on corporations . 
If many of these changes are accepted in the Senate , which hopes to finish voting on the plan by Friday , it could complicate the effort to work out differences between the two bills . 
It could also drive the overall cost of the legislation , which was $ 819 billion in the House version and is $ 887 billion in the Senate plan , much closer to the politically shaky $ 1 trillion mark . '' 
Sheryl Gay Stolberg writes in the New York Times : `` Mr. Obama is now on a quest to reshape the legislation in a way that will bring Senate Republicans , and perhaps eventually some House members as well , on board . 
On Monday , he will meet with Congressional Democratic leaders at the White House for further discussions on the package . '' 
David E. Sanger writes in the New York Times that `` one question is looming over their search for a cure : Can the government fashion a fast and efficient economic stimulus while also seizing the moment to remake America ? 
`` For now , Mr. Obama and his aides are insisting they can accomplish both goals , following their mantra of using the urgency of the economic crisis to accomplish larger and long-delayed reforms that never garnered sufficient votes in ordinary times . 
`` In fact , at various times in American history , moments like this one have been used for big programs , from integrating the armed forces to creating Social Security and , later , Medicare . 
So it is little wonder that everyone with a big , stalled , transformative project green energy programs , broadband networks that reach into rural America , health insurance for the newly unemployed or uninsured is citing the precedent of Franklin D. Roosevelt , and declaring that a new New Deal is overdue . 
`` But the question that the Senate will begin debating Monday is whether grand ambitions are getting in the way of pulling the country out of a nose dive . 
And so for every comparison of this moment to Roosevelt 's first hundred days , there are warnings that much of his social experimentation did not have a big impact on America 's economic recovery , which took years . '' 
Michael Scherer and Massimo Calabresi talk to Obama 's economic guru , Larry Summers : '' -LRB- T -RRB- his economic wunderkind turned Obama adviser is moving at flank speed on the biggest restructuring of the U.S. economy since the New Deal ... '' ` Any study of history reveals that with crisis comes enormous fluidity in the system , ' he says ... ` In Washington the transition from inconceivable to inevitable can be rapid if forced by events . ' 
... `` Some Republicans call the current plan wasteful ; free-spending Democrats long for more investments over years , not months . 
Summers argues that the stimulus bill splits the difference : not only will most of the money go to reviving the economy in the next 18 months , but much of it will also go to projects that could save money over the long term , such as weatherizing 75 % of federal buildings and computerizing medical records . 
` The bill does a good job of marrying the twin imperatives of putting people back to work and doing the work that needs to be done , ' he says . 
` No $ 825 billion bill is going to not have some projects that any individual disagrees with . ' 
`` Assuming the stimulus measure is passed -- in private , even top GOP aides believe it will happen by mid-February -- Summers says Obama will push next to stabilize the banks and the housing market . 
The Administration is weighing approaches that range from buying up banks ' bad assets or guaranteeing the solvency of banks that hold them to taking an even larger ownership stake in the institutions and then pouring more cash directly into them . 
None of the options , Obama Administration officials admit , are ideal . 
`` And then , perhaps as early as March , they 'll launch their biggest lift with the beginnings of a plan to reform Social Security and Medicare , the two entitlement programs that , even before the economy collapsed , were threatening the Treasury with bankruptcy . 
By any standard , it is a massive three-month agenda fraught with political risk . 
The key to getting it all done , Summers says , is entering into a ` compact ' with the country ` that this is n't just government as usual throwing money at things . ' '' 
By Dan Froomkin | February 2 , 2009 ; 1:40 PM ET We can recoup some of the cost of the new stimulus package by sending Republican congress members home and replacing them with a tape recorder that repeats the words `` tax cuts '' on a loop . 
It would even work to their benefit if Obama took up their idea . 
When the economy continues its nosedive because people are using their tax cuts to pay down credit cards , the GOP could just blame the tape recorder . 
and if people spend tax cuts the money goes to China !!! Posted by : knjincvc | February 2 , 2009 3:35 PM | Report abuse The currently designed stimulus package guarantees a one term presidency . 
Giving short term free lunches to nonproducers add flames to the downward spiral , for producers will hunker down and cut costs , manpower and wait out the administration . 
Why risk time , talent or treasure just to get taxed , criticized , sued , regulated , twirled by every politican 's whim ... the predictable alternative is ROPE-A-DOPE ... sort a roll off the ropes and fend off the dopes !!! Posted by : markone | February 2 , 2009 6:31 PM | Report abuse Is Matt Lauer aware ... ... that the Bush administration ran up over $ 5 TRILLION in DEFICITS in their first 7.5 years ? 
That 's nearly $ 17,000 per American . 
Sorry , I could n't stop laughing after I wrote `` Is Matt Lauer aware '' as the obvious answer is Matt Lauer is unaware of anything that is n't on his TelePrompTer or his ear prompter with his producer feeding him lines .

"The Obama administration 's emerging rescue plan for the banking system would amount to financial triage , with the Treasury Department playing the delicate role of deciding which of the trillions of dollars in troubled assets plaguing the economy to buy , guarantee or leave in the hands of banks , sources said . 
The high-stakes approach would dramatically increase the investment of taxpayer money in the financial industry , and the potential losses . 
The plan , which Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is set to announce Monday , is being crafted under tremendous political pressure from people who say the government is risking too much as well as from those who say it is not doing enough to end the crisis . 
Facing public anger over the rescue of firms many people blame for causing a recession , the Obama administration is focused on producing a plan that is not just effective but also politically palatable , sources said . 
Today , the administration is planning to announce tougher restrictions on compensation at companies that need massive government assistance to survive , including a $ 500,000 cap on executive pay . 
That move may not appease critics , because , sources said , most firms that get federal aid would not face severe pay conditions . 
The basic problem confronting the government is that banks hold large quantities of assets that they value on their books for much more than investors are willing to pay . 
Banks can not sell these assets without recording massive losses . 
But holding the assets is tying up vast amounts of money , choking the financial system . 
Since the early days of the financial crisis , officials have struggled to unwind that knot . 
If the government buys the assets at prices that banks consider fair , the Treasury would take a huge loss when it ultimately sells the assets for much less . 
If , instead , the government insists on paying market prices , the banks may not survive their losses . 
Instead of taking a single approach , the Obama administration plans to divide assets and other loans into three categories , each with its own solution , according to sources familiar with the discussions , speaking on condition of anonymity because the details are not finalized . 
The government would buy and hold on to those assets whose falling prices are putting banks under the most pressure . 
Officials want to limit these purchases because of the vast expense . 
The centerpiece of the plan would be a guarantee to limit losses on a second group of troubled assets that can be kept by the banks because they have more stable prices . 
And it would allow banks to retain and profit from their healthiest assets . 
Beyond these initiatives , the government also is likely to inject more capital into troubled institutions . 
The triage approach is a response to accounting rules .

"Fed 's Expanded Market Role Fuels Fierce Debate The Federal Reserve has used unconventional , aggressive means during the crisis . 
-LRB- By Jay Mallin -- Bloomberg News -RRB- For 95 years , the Federal Reserve has been the nation 's lender of last resort . 
Now it 's becoming the lender of first resort . 
Since the onset of the financial crisis , the Fed has used new , unconventional programs to indirectly make hundreds of billions of dollars available to people buying a house or a car or using a credit card , and to businesses large and small . 
The central bank , for instance , has pledged to make half a trillion dollars available for mortgages by buying packages of loans known as mortgage-backed securities . 
To Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and the economists who embrace his strategy , the central bank is using creative approaches to try to contain the worst financial crisis in generations , exercising its authority to restart lending in a world in which private markets have all but shut down . 
Central banks around the world are starting to mimic the approach . 
But the Fed is also now deciding how vast amounts of capital are deployed in the economy . 
Its actions so far have favored home buyers and consumers while doing much less prop up lending for businesses seeking to make long-term investments . 
Even analysts who support the Fed 's actions say they have distorted investment decisions and emboldened elected officials to pressure the central bank in ways that undermine its independence . 
`` The Fed is socializing the capital markets , '' said Ethan Harris , an economist at Barclays Capital , who nonetheless said he believes the Fed 's steps have been necessary . 
`` You 're creating a new class of welfare recipients . 
That 's why it 's extremely important that there be rules around transparency and lobbying , because the potential for abuse is high . 
And they have to exit out of this as quickly as markets allow them to . '' 
Deciding how to allocate capital is one of the most important functions in the economy . 
In modern capitalist societies , it happens as investors and lenders try to find businesses and loans that offer the highest possible returns relative to their risks . 
These markets make mistakes sometimes -- take , for example , the vast overinvestment in housing in the middle of this decade . 
But they have generally proven better at deploying capital toward useful purposes than any other system . 
The fall of the Soviet Union had a lot to do with the government 's failure to deploy capital efficiently , as did the economic stagnation of post-World War II Britain , when the government played an outsize role in business investment decisions . 
The U.S. government is nowhere near taking such a massive role . 
In the view of Bernanke and his allies , private markets are failing to do their job , so policymakers are essentially propping them up until they repair themselves . 
For centuries , central banks have bolstered banks during financial crises , these policymakers argue , adding that in an era when banks account for only a modest portion of all lending , it makes sense for the Fed to update its role as the lender of last resort . 
Critics , however , point out that the government is now deciding to help certain sectors and firms but not others . 
Stanford economist John B. Taylor , in a recent paper , argued that the Fed 's strategy amounts to a form of `` industrial policy . '' 
`` If we are to have an extensive industrial policy , it should be approved by the Congress with the purposes stated and debated transparently , '' Taylor wrote in the paper , presented at the American Economic Association 's annual meeting . 
`` Will such interventions only take place in recessions , or will Fed officials use them in the future to try to make economic expansions stronger or to assist certain sectors and industries for other reasons ? '' 
`` The Fed has sacrificed its independence , and I think it 's a disaster , '' said Allan H. Meltzer , an economist at Carnegie Mellon University and a leading historian of the central bank . 
`` It is creating a system of credit allocation , and if the government is going to do that , it should be done through fiscal policy , not as part of monetary policy . '' 
Other economists vehemently disagree . 
The Fed 's independence would be far more threatened if it were to stand by while the economy entered the worst downturn in 80 years , they argue . 
Moreover , the Fed is pushing more money into broad categories of lending , not deciding exactly how much cash goes to individual industries , let alone companies or individuals . 
"
"`` Organizational downsizing '' is one of the most detested phrases in the management vocabulary . 
Many managers say that the one action they hate more than anything else is letting somebody go , and downsizing entails letting dozens , sometimes thousands go . 
For those on the receiving end , aside from the immediate loss of income , health care , and work identity , the dreaded pink slip can foreshadow personal anguish , family stress , and the decline or even end of a work career . 
This is especially true when widespread hiring freezes and mass dismissals leave few employment alternatives . 
For those who unfortunately must lead the downsizing process , research from prior recessions point to the value of imagining they themselves may be riffed -LRB- a verb from the acronym , RIF , or `` reduction in force '' -RRB- . 
From this not so imaginary perspective -- those engineering a first round of layoffs are sometimes the victims of a second round -- here are four simple implications : 1 . 
Look for ways to minimize the downsizing as much as possible . 
Organizations have employed a host of measures to do so , including wage reductions and work furloughs . 
Disclose as much detailed information as possible . 
Employees hate an information vacuum when their work lives depend on it as much as nature abhors a vacuum . 
Provide as many forms of personal support as possible . 
These range from employment counseling and placement services to the temporary extensions of medical and dental benefits . 
Avoid repeated rounds of layoffs if possible . 
To be recurrently subjected to the threat of dismissal is to undergo a work version of water torture . 
Such steps are essential both for those let go as well as for those who survive . 
The latter must still get the job done , and their willingness to do so depends on the respect that remains for those who have led the downsizing . 
If the leaders ' actions are perceived as unavoidable , fair , and taken in ways that minimize the human toll , employee faith in them can constitute foundation for the next and very demanding step of turning around the enterprise . 
Here 's how not to do it . 
One manufacturing firm in a prior recession sent a manager around the shop floor late in the afternoon to tap employees on the shoulder and then walk them to a nearby room . 
There , the downsizing victims learned of their fate , and minutes later they were ushered out another door directly onto the street , with little more than a promise that their personal effects would be mailed . 
Knowing that a tap on the shoulder presaged such a fate , some employees took to hiding in the restrooms late in the day , an understandable if unsuccessful expression of the dread that downsizing strikes in all .

"Tuesday , February 10 , 2009 ; 11:44 AM SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD -LRB- D-CONN . -RRB- 
Twenty-one days ago today , as he articulated the challenges we American face , President Obama asked all of us to participate in a new era of shared responsibility and cooperation . 
Today , as the United States Senate votes on a bipartisan plan to stimulate our economy and create jobs and invest in our middle-class families , we 're going to hear Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner lay out the administration 's long-term , comprehensive framework to lead our nation back to economic recovery . 
The framework will require swift and concerted action by policy - makers throughout our government using existing authorities . 
The elements it may require will require new legislation and , certainly , I look forward along with my colleagues , to work with the secretary and his staff in that effort to flush out the details in the coming days and week . 
Secretary Geithner understands the enormity of the challenges we all face as nation . 
Regretfully and for too long , his predecessors failed fully to realize the financial health and security of consumers is inextricably linked to the success of the American economy , that without applying the same urgent focus to helping homeowners that we apply to supporting our financial institutions efforts to restart lending , we are not able to break the negative cycle of rising foreclosures and declining credit that is damaging our economy so much . 
DODD : With nearly 10,000 families facing foreclosure and 19,000 Americans losing their jobs every single day , we understand just how much the health of our economy rests on the financial wellbeing of American workers and small businesses . 
So while it is important to know how we came to this , it is even more important , far more important , to understand how we move forward to recovery and prosperity . 
Today we will hear a new set of ideas about how the troubled assets weighing on our financial system should be valued , transferred and structured so that credit can start flowing again . 
In the coming days , we will hear about a way forward for American families , buckling under the weight of unaffordable mortgages , including more than 25,000 in my home state of Connecticut . 
We 'll hear how focus must be simply -- not simply on our financial institutions , rather , but also on those who rely upon them , homeowners seeking options to keep their homes , small businesses that rely on payroll accounts and banks , and entrepreneurs who need access to capital to generate jobs of the future . 
Today , as the Senate casts an historic vote for an economic stimulus package that addresses the jobs and income losses facing American families by investing in our future , we look forward to Secretary Geithner 's announcement of a comprehensive plan to get credit flowing again . 
Together , saving jobs and unfreezing credit are designed to offer the opportunity for a fresh , new start for American homeowners , consumers and businesses , a fresh , new start for transparency and accountability in how taxpayer dollars are going to be used , and a fresh , new start for the public and private sectors , for all Americans , in fact , as we work together in partnership to stabilize our nation 's economy . 
Continuing the exchange of ideas between co-equal branches of government is the way this process should work . 
And all Americans , including my colleagues , want the process to work . 
DODD : And with that , I 'm very pleased to announce the secretary of our nation 's Treasury , Timothy Geithner . 
TREASURY SECRETARY TIMOTHY GEITHNER : Thank you , Senator Dodd . 
And thanks to all of you for coming here today . 
President Obama said in his inaugural address that our economic strength is derived from the doers , the makers of things , the innovators who create and expand enterprises , the workers who provide life to companies . 
This is what drives economic growth . 
The financial system , your banks , are central to this process . 
Banks and the credit markets transform the earnings and savings of American workers into the loans that finance a first home , a new car , or a college education . 
And this system provides the capital and the credit necessary to build a company around a new idea . 
Without credit , economies can not grow at their potential . 
And right now , critical parts of our financial system are damaged . 
The credit markets that are essential for small businesses and consumers are not working . 
Borrowing costs have risen sharply for state and local governments , for students trying to pay for college , and for businesses large and small . 
Many banks are reducing lending . 
And across the country , they are tightening the terms of loans . 
Last Friday , we learned that the economy had lost 3 million jobs last year and an additional 600,000 jobs just last month . 
As demand falls and credit tightens , businesses around the world are cutting back the investments that are essential to future growth . 
Trade among nations is contracting sharply as finance dries up . 
Home prices are still falling as foreclosures rise , and even credit - worthy borrowers are finding it harder to finance the purchase of a new home or to refinance their existing mortgage . 
Instead of catalyzing recovery , the financial system is working against recovery . 
At the same time , the recession is putting greater pressure on banks . 
This is a dangerous dynamic , and we need to arrest it . 
It 's essential that every American understand that the battle for economic recovery must be fought on two fronts . 
We have to jump-start job creation and private investment , and we must get credit flowing again to businesses and to families . 
Without a powerful economic recovery act , too many Americans will lose their jobs and too many businesses will fail . 
And unless we restore the flow of credit , the recession will be deeper and longer , causing even more damage to families and businesses across the country . 
Now , today , as Congress moves to pass the economic recovery plan that will help create jobs and lay a foundation for a stronger economic future , we are outlining a new financial stability plan . 
Our plan will help restart the flow of credit , it will help clean up and strengthen our banks , and it will provide critical aid for homeowners and for small businesses . 
And as we do each of these things , we will impose new higher standards for transparency and accountability . 
GEITHNER : I 'm going to outline the key elements of this plan today , but before I do that , I want to say a bit about how we got here . 
The causes of this crisis are many and complex . 
They accumulated over a long period of time , and they will take time to resolve . 
Governments and central banks around the world pursued policies that , with the benefit of hindsight , caused a huge global boom in credit , pushed housing prices and financial markets to levels that defied gravity . 
Investors in banks to do risks they did not understand . 
Individuals , businesses , and governments borrowed beyond their means . 
The rewards that went to financial executives departed from any realistic appreciation of risk . 
There were systematic failures in the checks and balances in our system by boards of directors , by credit rating agencies , and by government regulators . 
Our financial system operated with large gaps in meaningful oversight and without sufficient constraints to limit risk . 
Even institutions that were overseen by our complicated and overlapping system of multiple regulators put themselves in a position of extreme vulnerability . 
And these failures helped lay the foundation for the worst economic crisis in generations . 
And when the crisis began , governments were slow to act . 
When action came , it was late and inadequate . 
Policy was behind the curve always chasing an escalating crisis . 
And as the crisis intensified and more dramatic government action was required , the emergency actions that were meant to reassure to provide confidence , too often , added to public anxiety and to investor uncertainty . 
The dramatic failure or near failure of some of the world 's largest financial institutions caused investors to full back from taking risk . 
Last fall , as the crisis intensified , Congress acted quickly and courageously to give your government the emergency authority to help contain the damage . 
Your government used that authority to help pull the financial system back from the edge of catastrophic failure . 
And those actions were absolutely essential , but they were inadequate . 
The force of government support was not comprehensive or quick enough to withstand the acute pressure brought on by a weakening economy and the spectacle of huge amounts of taxpayer assistance provided to the same institutions that helped caused the crisis added to public distrust . 
And this distrust turned to anger as boards of directors at some institutions continued to reward rich compensation packages and lavish perks to their senior executives . 
Our challenge is much great today because the American people have lost faith in the leaders of some of our financial institutions , and they are skeptical that their government has used taxpayer 's money in ways that will benefit them . 
This has to change . 
To get credit flowing again , to restore confidence in our markets , and to restore the faith of the American people , we are going to fundamentally reshape our program to repair the financial system . 
Our work will be guided by the lessons of the last 18 months and by the lessons of financial crises throughout history . 
And the basic principles that will shape our strategy or the following . 
We believe that policy has to be comprehensive and forceful . 
There is more risk and greater cost in gradualism than there is in aggressive action . 
We believe that action has to be sustained until recovery is firmly established . 
In this country , in the 1930 's , in Japan in the 1990 's , and in many cases , elsewhere around the world , crises lasted longer and they caused greater damage because governments applied the brakes too early . 
We can not make that mistake . 
We believe that access to public support is a privilege , not a right . 
When our government provides support to banks , it is not for the benefit of banks . 
It is for the businesses and families to depend on banks . 
And it 's for the benefit of the country . 
Government support has to come with strong conditions to protect the taxpayer and with transparency that allows the American people to see the impact of those investments . 
We believe that our policies must be designed to mobilize and leverage private capital , not to supplant or discourage private capital . 
When government investment is necessary , it should be replaced with private capital as soon as that is possible . 
And we believe that the United States has to send a clear and consistent message that we will act to prevent the catastrophic failure of financial institutions that would damage the broader economy . 
Guided by these principles , we will replace the current program with a new financial stability plan designed to stabilize and repair the financial system and to report -- to support the flow of credit that is necessary for recovery . 
GEITHNER : This new financial stability plan will take a comprehensive approach . 
The Department of the Treasury , the Federal Reserve , the FDIC , and all of the financial agencies in our country will bring the full force of the United States government to bear to strengthen our financial system so that we get the economy back on track . 
Now , these agencies , each have different authorities , instruments and responsibilities , but we are one government , serving the American people , and we will work together as one . 
Now , here 's what we will do : Our work begins with a new framework of oversight in governance on all aspects of our financial stability plan . 
The American people will be able to see where their tax dollars are going and the return on their government 's investment . 
They will be able to see whether the conditions placed on banks are being met and enforced . 
They will be able to see whether boards of directors are being responsible with the taxpayer dollars and how they are compensating their executives . 
And they will be able to see how these actions are affecting the overall flow of lending and the cost of borrowing . 
These new requirements , which will be available on a new Web site , financialstability . 
gov , will give the American people the transparency they deserve . 
Now , these steps -- these steps build on things we have already done . 
We have acted to ensure the integrity of the process that provides access to government support so that it is independent of influence from lobbyists and from politics . 
We 've committed to provide the American people with the information on how their money is spent and under what conditions by posting these contracts on the Internet . 
And , importantly , we 've outlined some strong conditions on executive compensation . 
Now , under this framework , we are establishing three new programs to clean up and strengthen the nation 's banks , to bring in private capital to restart lending , and to go around the banking system directly to the markets that consumers and businesses depend on . 
Let me describe each of these three steps . 
First , we 're going to require banking institutions to go through a carefully designed comprehensive stress test . 
This borrows the medical term . 
We want their balance sheets cleaner and stronger , and we 're going to help this process by providing a new program of capital support for those institutions that need it . 
To do this , we 're going to bring together the agencies with authority over our nation 's banks and initiate a more consistent , realistic , forward-looking assessment about the exposures on bank balance sheets , and we 're going to introduce new measures to improve disclosure . 
Those institutions that need additional capital will be able to access a new funding mechanism that uses capital from the Treasury as a bridge to private capital . 
The capital will come with conditions to help ensure that every dollar of taxpayer assistance is being used to generate a level of lending greater than what would have been possible in the absence of government support . 
And this assistance will come with terms that should encourage these institutions to replace public assistance with private capital as soon as that is possible . 
The Treasury 's investments in these institutions will be placed in a new financial stability trust . 
Now , second , we will work together with the Federal Reserve , with the FDIC , and with the private sector to establish a public-private investment fund . 
And this program will provide government capital and government financing to help leverage private capital to help get private markets working again . 
This fund will be targeted to the legacy loans and assets that are now burdening many financial institutions . 
By providing the financing the private markets can not now provide , this will help start a market for the real estate-related assets that are at the center of this financial crisis . 
Our objective is to use private capital and private asset managers to help provide a market mechanism for valuating -- for valuing these assets . 
Now , we 're exploring a range of different structures , and we 'll seek input from the public as we design this program . 
But we believe this program should ultimately provide up to $ 1 trillion in financing capacity , but we plan to start it on a scale of about $ 500 billion , and we will expand it based on what works . 
The third piece of this program : Working jointly with the Federal Reserve , we are prepared to commit up to $ 1 trillion to support consumer and business lending . 
This initiative will help kick-start the secondary lending markets to help bring down borrowing costs and to help get credit flowing again . 
In our financial system , roughly 40 percent of consumer lending has typically been made available because people buy loans , put them together , and sell them . 
And because this vital source of lending has frozen up , no financial recovery plan will be successful unless it helps restart the securitization markets for sound loans made to consumers and to businesses large and small . 
GEITHNER : This program will be built on the Federal Reserve 's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility that was announced last November with capital from the Treasury and financing from the Federal Reserve . 
We 've agreed to expand this program to target the markets that are critical for small-business lending , for student loans , for consumer and auto finance , and for commercial mortgages . 
Now , in addition , because small businesses are so important to our economy , we 're going to take some additional steps to make it easier for them to get credit from community banks and from large banks . 
By increasing the federally guaranteed portion of small business association -- administration loans , and by giving more power to the SBA to expedite loan approvals , we believe we can turn around the dramatic decline in SBA lending we 've seen in recent months . 
Now , finally -- and this is critically important -- we will launch a comprehensive housing program . 
Millions of Americans have lost their homes , and millions more live with the risk that they will be unable to meet their payments or refinance their mortgages . 
Many of these families borrowed beyond their means , but many others fell victim to terrible lending practices that left them exposed , overextended , and with no way to refinance . 
On top of that , homeowners around the country are seeing the value of their homes fall because of forces they did not create and can not control . 
This crisis in housing has had devastating consequences , and our government should have moved more forcefully to help contain the damage . 
As housing prices fall , demand for housing will increase and conditions will ultimately find a new balance , and you 're seeing that happen in parts of the country today . 
But now we risk an intensifying spiral in which lenders foreclose , pushing house prices lower , and reducing the value of household savings , making it harder for all families to refinance . 
The president has asked his economic team to come together with a comprehensive plan to address this crisis , and we will announce the details of this plan in the next few weeks . 
But our focus will be on using the full resources of the government to help bring down mortgage payments and to help reduce mortgage interest rates . 
We 'll do this with a substantial commitment of resources already authorized by the Congress under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act . 
Now , I want to add that , looking forward , President Obama is committed to moving quickly to reform our entire system of financial regulation so that we never again face a crisis of this severity . 
We are consulting closely with Chairman Chris Dodd in the Senate , Chairman Barney Frank in the House , and their colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the broad outlines of a comprehensive program of reforms . 
The president 's working group on financial markets is beginning to develop detailed recommendations , and we will start working closely with the world 's leading economies on a set of broader reforms to the international financial system in preparation for the G-20 summit in London on April 2nd . 
The success of this plan , the success of our financial stability plan is going to require an unprecedented level of cooperation here in the United States and around the world . 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , FDIC Chair Sheila Bair , John Dugan , the comptroller of the currency , and John Reich , the head of the Office of Thrift Supervision , I want to thank them for helping shape this plan , and I want to thank them for their commitment to making it work . 
This program is going to require a substantial and sustained commitment of public resources . 
Congress has already authorized substantial resources for this effort , and we 're going to use those resources as carefully and as effectively as possible . 
We 're going to consult closely with the Congress as we move forward , and we 're going to work together to make sure that we have the resources and the authority to make this work . 
Later this week , I 'm going to be traveling to meet with the G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors in Italy , and there we will start the process of working with our international partners to ensure that we 're working together to help strengthen the global economy and to help repair the global financial system . 
And we will work closely with the leadership of the IMF and the World Bank so that they can deploy resources quickly to help those countries around the world that are most at risk from this crisis . 
Now , many of the programs I 've discussed involve very large numbers . 
But it 's important to recognize that these programs involve loans and investments with terms and conditions that will help protect the taxpayer and help compensate the government for the risk we are taking . 
And because of these terms and conditions , the risks to the taxpayers will be less than the headline numbers . 
Our obligation is to design these programs so that we are achieving the largest benefit in terms of supporting recovery at the least cost to the taxpayer . 
And we take that obligation extremely seriously . 
But I want to be candid : This strategy will cost money , it will involve risk , and it will take time . 
But as costly as this effort may be , we know that the cost of a complete collapse of our financial system would be incalculable for families and for businesses and for our nation . 
GEITHNER : We are going to have to adapt our program as conditions change . 
We will have to try things we never tried before . 
We will make mistakes . 
We will go throughout periods in which things get worse and progress is uneven or interrupted . 
But we will be guided by these core principles of transparency and accountability , dedicated to the object of restoring credit to families and businesses and committed to moving our nation towards an economic recovery that is as swift and widespread as possible . 
This is a challenge more complex than any challenge our financial system as faced . 
It 's going to require new programs and extraordinary action . 
But the president and his entire administration are committed to seeing it through because we know how directly the future of our economy depends on it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you for coming .

"Obama Says Economic Crisis Comes First President Obama declared last night in his first prime-time news conference that the task of saving and creating jobs is more important than cultivating the bipartisan cooperation he promised to bring to Washington , and he pressed his case for the massive economic stimulus plan working its way through Congress . 
Warning that inaction could `` turn a crisis into a catastrophe , '' Obama rejected criticism from Republicans about the legislation 's effect on the federal deficit , noting that government debt had ballooned on his predecessor 's watch . 
Although he called for lawmakers to break out of their `` ideological rigidity , '' he was unapologetic as he pushed a package with a cost of more than $ 800 billion that has so far drawn only nominal Republican support . 
`` I ca n't afford to see Congress play the usual political games . 
What we have to do right now is deliver for the American people , '' Obama said just hours after the legislation narrowly cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate , where it is likely to gain final passage today . 
The bill will then become the subject of potentially contentious negotiations between House and Senate leaders . 
It is unclear whether it will reach the president 's desk before a scheduled congressional recess next week . 
Obama repeatedly stressed the need for swift and aggressive action on the economy , pitting his plan against those who he said would `` do nothing '' to assist a desperate public . 
`` So , you know , we can differ on some of the particulars , but again , the question I think that the American people are asking is : Do you just want government to do nothing , or do you want it to do something ? 
If you want it to do something , then we can have a conversation , '' he said . 
`` But doing nothing -- that 's not an option , from my perspective . '' 
Obama defended the role of government in the recovery process , saying that `` with the private sector so weakened by this recession , the federal government is the only entity left with the resources to jolt our economy back to life . '' 
The president fielded 13 questions from reporters in his first wide-ranging session since he took office , touching briefly on foreign policy , his long-range agenda and sports . 
But the economy dominated the event . 
Asked about the next allotment of money to aid troubled banks , he said he is dissatisfied with the way the first $ 350 billion was spent . 
`` We did n't get as big a bang for the buck as we should have '' from the Troubled Assets Relief Program , Obama said . 
`` My immediate task is making sure that the second half of that money -- $ 350 billion -- is spent properly . '' 
That allocation process will begin today , when Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is slated to detail the administration 's strategy for releasing the remaining bailout money . 
Obama stepped to the podium in the East Room of the White House at 8:01 p.m. , opening with prepared remarks on the economy that set the tone for the night . 
Somber and focused , he alternated between defending some specific provisions of the legislation and discussing its broad framework , repeatedly arguing that the public would prefer even a flawed government response over inaction . 
He said he thought an economic recovery could begin to set in by 2010 but warned that 2009 will continue to be a `` difficult year . '' 
He did not crack any jokes , aside from a playful greeting of veteran reporter Helen Thomas , and ended the appearance promptly at 9 p.m. Still , the president conveyed a firm tone . 
Asked whether he risked appearing to be too much of an alarmist about the economic peril facing the United States , possibly undermining public confidence in the system , he became almost defensive . 
`` No , no , no , no , '' he said . 
`` I think that what I 've said is what other economists have said across the political spectrum , which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity , then you potentially create a negative spiral that becomes much more difficult for us to get out of . '' 
He compared the situation to that of Japan in the 1990s , saying the Japanese , failing to act quickly enough , suffered a `` lost decade . '' 
`` This is not your ordinary , run-of-the-mill recession , '' he said . 
In a brief foray into foreign policy , Obama said with regard to Iran that the administration `` will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table , face-to-face diplomatic overtures '' with the Islamic republic . 
He said that `` there 's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years , so it 's not going to happen overnight '' and that `` even as we engage in this direct diplomacy , we are very clear about certain deep concerns '' about Iranian links to militant groups and possible pursuit of a nuclear weapon . 
In stark contrast to former president George W. Bush , Obama did not say that the United States would refuse to tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran . 
Instead , he all but invited Iran to signal that it , too , is interested in talks . 
`` Now it 's time for Iran to send some signals that it wants to act differently , as well , and recognize that , even as it has some rights as a member of the international community , with those rights come responsibilities , '' he said . 
The news conference ended a day of action on the stimulus package : Obama traveled to Elkhart , Ind. , to promote the legislation as it made its way toward the Senate floor , clearing a procedural hurdle by a vote of 61 to 36 that set the stage for final passage today . 
Only three Republicans -- moderate Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- supported the legislation . 
In the House , no Republicans voted for the $ 819 billion version of the stimulus package that passed on Jan. 28 .

"LONDON , Feb. 10 -- Fred , Tom , Andy , Dennis , Eric , John , Stephen , Antonio and Paul ran British banks that lost billions of dollars . 
So they have been called in for a grilling by Nick , Graham , Colin , Jim , Stephen , Michael , Andrew , George , Mark , Peter , three Johns -- and a single , solitary Sally . 
The interrogation of the lions of British banking , many of whom have lost their jobs , began on live television Tuesday before the financial overseers of Parliament 's Treasury Select Committee . 
And in line with the usual math of the financial world , 18 of the 19 key people in the room were men . 
`` Clearly , something needs to change , '' said Howard Archer , chief European and U.K. economist at IHS Global Insight in London . 
`` You can argue that the men have made a right mess of it , and now the ladies should have a go . '' 
As the global financial crisis deepens , the first rumblings of a gender revolution are underway in an industry long controlled by men . 
Banks , hedge funds and other financial organizations that have led the international economy 's downward spiral are overwhelmingly male-dominated . 
The regulators and legislators assigned to oversee the financiers are also mostly men . 
`` There are quite a lot of alpha males with testosterone steaming out their ears , '' said Stuart Fraser , one of London 's top financial sector officials . 
In Britain , women account for just 12 percent of corporate directorships of companies on the FTSE 100 stock exchange index , according to a group of major British business leaders who have called for `` urgent action '' to increase the number of women at the top levels of business . 
In the United States , women hold 17 percent of the corporate directorships -- and 2.5 percent of the CEO posts -- in the finance and insurance industries , according to Catalyst , a U.S.-based nonprofit group that promotes opportunities for women in business . 
`` Maybe if we had some more women in the boardrooms , we may not have seen as much risk-taking behavior , '' said Hazel Blears , one of two female members of Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's cabinet who weighed in on the gender debate here this week . 
Harriet Harman , the minister for women and equality , blasted the banking world for `` discrimination and harassment '' against women , including a culture of using lap-dancing clubs for corporate entertainment . 
Amid the debate about whether the financial crisis would have happened , or been as severe , if more women had been in charge , there are signs that more women will be taking part in the global rescue .

"President Obama finds himself at a disadvantage today when it comes to defending the bank-bailout plan announced by his Treasury secretary yesterday . 
At the very least , as Frank James blogs for Tribune , Obama oversold what Timothy Geithner ended up delivering . 
At his Monday night press conference , Obama said Geithner would `` be announcing some very clear and specific plans for how we are going to start loosening up credit once again ... It means that we correct some of the mistakes with TARP that were made earlier , the lack of consistency , the lack of clarity in terms of how the program was going to move forward . '' 
But as David Cho and Lori Montgomery write in The Washington Post , `` the lack of detail in -LRB- Geithner 's -RRB- plan dismayed lawmakers and investors , triggering a steep sell-off on Wall Street ... `` The Treasury Department provided only the most general descriptions of how struggling homeowners and small businesses would be helped . 
And officials said they have yet to design a program that is a core part of the plan : A public-private initiative that would encourage investors to buy up the toxic assets now weighing down the books of banks and threatening to overwhelm the firms with losses . 
`` Cleansing the financial system of these assets , which are backed by failing mortgages and other troubled loans , has vexed officials since Congress approved the $ 700 billion rescue package in October . 
But financial analysts said Geithner , who took a strong hand in casting the new plan , appeared to have no better grasp on a solution than his predecessor , Henry M. Paulson Jr. '' Neil Irwin writes in The Washington Post : `` In rolling out his overhaul of the financial rescue yesterday , Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner lambasted the Bush administration 's response to the crisis over the past year . '' 
` Policy was always behind the curve , always chasing the escalating crisis , ' Geithner said , criticizing his predecessor , Henry M. Paulson Jr. ` The emergency actions meant to provide confidence and reassurance too often added to public anxiety and to investor uncertainty . ' 
`` But yesterday , Geithner seemed to be following the Hank Paulson playbook , according to a wide consensus on Wall Street , in Washington , and beyond . '' 
In Geithner 's defense , he 's trying to solve an enormously complicated problem in a challenging political environment . 
Jim Puzzanghera and Maura Reynolds write in the Los Angeles Times about the `` double bind for the Obama administration . 
`` Fixing the financial system has turned out to be a bigger , harder and much more expensive challenge than expected , potentially requiring billions more in additional federal commitments . 
`` But the political climate has turned so sour that Congress , enraged by what it sees as irresponsible excesses by Wall Street executives , is unlikely to approve more funding , at least for now . 
`` As a result , the administration is moving toward approaches that reduce the government 's financial risk and require no new congressional action . 
But those constraints mean the plans are taking longer to design and implement . '' 
Deborah Solomon writes in the Wall Street Journal : `` A senior Treasury official said the administration explored ` quite a few alternatives ' but concluded it was a ` challenge ' to have the government set a price for the bad assets . 
Instead , they believe their structure will allow the private sector to value them . '' 
In his interview with ABC News 's Terry Moran yesterday , Obama did n't seem overly troubled at Wall Street 's negative reaction to the Geithner plan . 
`` Well , you know , Wall Street , I think , is hoping for an easy out on this thing and there is no easy out . 
Essentially , what you 've got are a set a banks that have not been as transparent as we need to be in terms of what their books look like , '' Obama said . 
`` And we 're going to have to hold out the Band-Aid a little bit and go ahead and just be clear about some of the losses that have been made because until we do that , we 're not going to be able to attract private capital into the marketplace . 
And so , you know , I think that you have two choices in this situation : You can prolong the agony and shareholders will be happy until they 're not happy , and that could be a year from now or two years from now , or , in the case of Japan , eight years later . 
`` Or you can just go ahead and acknowledge that , yeah , there 's a lot of work that has to be done to put these banks back on a firmer footing . '' 
Obama also explained why he thinks nationalizing banks -- the increasingly preferred solution of many left-leaning economists -- would n't make sense . 
Moran : `` There are a lot of economists who look at these banks and they say all that garbage that 's in them renders them essentially insolvent . 
Why not just nationalize the banks ? '' 
Obama : `` Well , you know , it 's interesting . 
There are two countries who have gone through some big financial crises over the last decade or two . 
One was Japan , which never really acknowledged the scale and magnitude of the problems in their banking system and that resulted in what 's called ` The Lost Decade . ' 
They kept on trying to paper over the problems . 
The markets sort of stayed up because the Japanese government kept on pumping money in . 
But , eventually , nothing happened and they didn `` t see any growth whatsoever . 
`` Sweden , on the other hand , had a problem like this . 
They took over the banks , nationalized them , got rid of the bad assets , resold the banks and , a couple years later , they were going again . 
So you 'd think looking at it , Sweden looks like a good model . 
Here 's the problem ; Sweden had like five banks . 
-LRB- He laughs . -RRB- 
We 've got thousands of banks . 
You know , the scale of the U.S. economy and the capital markets are so vast and the problems in terms of managing and overseeing anything of that scale , I think , would -- our assessment was that it wouldn `` t make sense . 
And we also have different traditions in this country . '' 
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman responds in his blog : `` Yes , we have thousands of banks but the problems are concentrated in a handful of big players . 
In fact , the Geithner plan , such as it is , already acknowledges this : the ` stress test ' is to be applied only to banks with assets over $ 100 billion , of which there are supposed to be around 14 . 
`` And the argument that our culture won t stand for nationalization well , our culture isn t too friendly towards bank bailouts of any kind . 
Yet those bailouts are necessary ; and even in America they may be more palatable if taxpayers at least get to throw the bums out . 
`` Oh , and not a week goes by without the FDIC taking several smaller banks into receivership . 
Nationalization is actually as American as apple pie . '' 
By Dan Froomkin | February 11 , 2009 ; 12:35 PM ET There 's no point in building roads that in twenty years will lead to abandoned settlements . 
Where 's my `` Gore 2000 '' T-shirt again ? 
Can anyone tell us who instigated this breathtaking run in such a short time ? 
That kind of laser accurate strike on the financial system does n't occur on its own does it ? 
Especially coming such a short time after the Republican Convention with McCain surging in the polls . 
We are not getting the truth from anybody on what 's really going on here . 
Come on WaPo : do your investigative job and stop twiddling over the Obama Soap opera . 
Geithner was not specific . 
And I guess I am not too disturbed about the lack of specificity right now . 
I am disturbed that Obama oversold it and that he was content to put Geithner out there when he was n't ready . 
Here 's the problem from my perspective . 
Geithner speech yesterday was not meant for Wall Street but for Main Street . 
Obama wants to show that he is aware of the problem and that he is doing something about it . 
Obama has a lot of irons in the fire right now and all of them are red-hot . 
He has to get the stimulus bill passed and before he can drop the dime on us about the costs of the financial bail-out . 
I saw Geithner speech as laying down the direction , if not the premises , of what this program will have to entail at the same time allaying the effect of culture shock that would occur if this all came in one big speech . 
Wall Street was just as upset , I reckon , that Geithner said that this will not be a 100 % gov ' t bailout : that they will have to pick up some of the costs of recovery . 
So the Dow dropped 400 points yesterday at the bad news . 
I do n't care . 
I am not part of the vaunted `` investor class . '' 
The heck with Wall Street . 
They are going to do what it is that they do anyhow . 
Let 's hear their ideas , and Republican ideas while we 're at it , of how they should and are going to get out of this mess . 
Obama has n't even been president for 3 weeks . 
By now , Bush would have been upstairs in the White House residence playing golf on his PS3 . 
They 've been put in a terrible , terrible position . 
Either way you look at it , there will be people trying to blame the current administration for the mess we are in as if they are supposed to have some magic plan waive a wand and fix it . 
But how does one fix years of unchecked , unabashed , intentional greed and manipulation of the publics earnings and gullibility . 
Greed on the part of banks and conservatives who think it is okay for businesses to do whatever they want with no accountability , and to the general public that often times prefer to follow behind material trends instead of living within their means and using their heads . 
Now we know in more ways then one that we are not made of steel and like the rest of the world we can hurt when our behavior is not disciplined or respectful to the laws of cause and effect . 
There is nothing that anyone could tell me to make me believe that when those interest rates first dropped for housing loans then continued to stay low even as the prices of homes skyrocketed that the government in power then did not know what would happen if they continued on that course . 
They knew this was coming just as I knew . 
Those over educated , pompous people knew what would happen . 
Why they did it -- well now that is the question to be answered and the mystery to be solved . 
Why would they want to bankrupt America ? 
I mean 1 percent chance that they were really just that dumb . 
Now , with all the things they can pick apart about the stimulus what solutions can they offer ? 
Oh , I know the same ones they offered over the past 8 years . 
Tax breaks , tax breaks , tax breaks that have done no good and that do no good . 
So what is the real agenda and point ? 
Am I the only one who d like to know what s really up besides such shameless desperation for power that repubs would crush America s citizens and thus America ? 
If they got back into the presidency in four years then what ? 
Resume the course of destruction is that on purpose ? 
I am just a humble citizen trying to understand . 
After all , they 're already saying that the 2006 mid-term results `` caused '' the current financial crisis . 
I 'm more interested in constructive solutions . 
I posted one small idea on my blog at bgladd.blogspot.com Posted by : BGladd | February 11 , 2009 2:30 PM | Report abuse @anla1974 : `` Why they did it -- well now that is the question to be answered and the mystery to be solved . '' 
No big mystery really . 
Artificially propping up the economy via the housing market was necessary for the maintaining the illusion that , as candidate McCain said , `` the fundamentals of our economy are strong . '' 
Just as corporations use accounting tricks to push unpleasantness down the road , so too did those in charge use economic tricks to forestall the inevitable crisis . 
This was self-evident to anyone willing to put politics aside , but no one wanted to blow the whistle as long as times were good . 
The only part of the plan that went wrong was that the market gave out before January 20th . 
Hence the planned argument , `` it 's Obama 's fault '' , had to be modified to become `` it 's the fault of the Dems who were elected in 2006 . '' 
If Republicans spent half as much time governing as they do scheming to place blame , we 'd all be filthy rich . 
Why is it that no one has pointed out that Nouriel Roubini sent out an RGE Monitor report today that actually explained and approved of Geitner 's plan as presented ? 
It provides clarity where everyone else has been claiming obscurity . 
It seems many should think about going back to school for refresher classes , in particular the dolts at CNBC .

"Wednesday , February 11 , 2009 ; 5:18 PM The Office of Thrift Supervision today called for the mortgage lenders it regulates to halt foreclosures until the Obama administration puts in place a program to help struggling homeowners . 
After presenting a plan to boost the financial sector yesterday , Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said that a $ 50 billion initiative to help homeowners facing foreclosure is not expected for at least a week . 
The delay and the price tag -- it was the low end of expectations -- disappointed consumer advocates and lawmakers anticipating the announcement . 
OTS is joining consumer advocates and some in Congress , including Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , who have called for lenders to institute a moratorium on foreclosures in the meantime . 
This adds to the pressure facing the administration as it finalizes details of the plan amid growing frustration about the ineffectiveness of government and industry efforts to stem foreclosures . 
Geithner and Shaun Donovan , secretary the Department of Housing and Urban Development , also met with more than two dozen officials from large banks , nonprofit groups and industry groups today to discuss foreclosure prevention plans . 
The discussion , held at the Department of Treasury , lasted for more than an hour . 
`` The thing that was striking was the uniformity of support for the idea that we can no longer rely on a voluntary system '' under which the financial services industry leads the foreclosure prevention effort , said John Taylor , president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition . 
There was also strong support for a program to have the government buy troubled mortgages held by lenders at a discount and put the borrowers through a modification program , he said . 
`` I know that is going to cost some people some money , but the truth is the foreclosures keep driving us further into this recession , '' said Taylor . 
Government officials have said the new loan modification program would be a `` more aggressive version '' of the one launched late last year by mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
That program has been criticized for not going far enough to help homeowners . 
`` We want to get a plan as soon as possible because the delay is causing homeowners to suffer even more than they have , '' said Pam Banks , policy counsel for Consumers Union . 
`` Time is of the essence . '' 
The temporary moratorium being called for by OTS may be beneficial since the administration 's plan could provide assistance to lenders that modify troubled loans , said Bob Davis , executive vice president for the American Bankers Association , an industry group . 
`` I view this is a prudent reminder to banks that a new solution may be coming , '' he said . 
ING Direct , one of the largest thrifts regulated by OTS , said it already has a moratorium in place through the end of March . 
`` We 're not living under normal circumstances and we have to act differently and help everybody to get by as well as possible , '' said Cathy MacFarlane , a company spokesman . 
Last year , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac temporarily suspended foreclosures during the holiday season so more people could be included in the loan modification program they had unveiled . 
Fannie Mae extended its moratorium for owner-occupied properties through the end of this month and said it has been able to help about 13 percent of the thousands of homeowners that were scheduled for foreclosure during the moratorium . 
OTS regulates more than 800 savings and loans across the country , including American Bank in Rockville and First Market Bank in Virginia . 
`` OTS-regulated institutions would be supporting the national imperative to combat the economic crisis by suspending foreclosures until the new plan takes hold , '' John Reich , the agency 's director , said in a statement . 
The foreclosure rate has been rising and appears to be accelerating as the recession deepens . 
As housing prices continue to plummet , lawmakers are also considering legislation to allow bankruptcy judges to modify loans , including lowering the principal owed on the mortgage to the current value of the home .

"Justice Department Putting New Focus on Combating Corporate Fraud Ten years ago , a Justice Department official drafted a set of guidelines for prosecuting corporate crime . 
Little noticed at the time , the strategy ultimately transformed the way prosecutors pursue corrupt businesses -- by exhorting them to hire their own investigators and share the results with the government in exchange for leniency in plea deals . 
The memo 's author was Eric H. Holder Jr. , who has become the nation 's attorney general at the same time that a financial crisis is putting pressure on prosecutors to hold businesses accountable for fraud . 
`` I want to see people prosecuted , '' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy -LRB- D-Vt . -RRB- 
said yesterday at a hearing that examined the Justice Department 's handling of corporate corruption . 
Senators from both parties are advocating that more federal resources be devoted to investigating business fraud , pointing out that such prosecutions plunged after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , when more than 2,000 FBI agents were diverted to protect national security . 
Justice Department and FBI officials committed anew to weeding out fraud in the marketplace , telling lawmakers that they are looking into more than 530 cases of alleged corporate malfeasance . 
Among them are 38 investigations of name-brand businesses and financial institutions involved in the financial crisis , including American International Group , Countrywide Financial , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
FBI Deputy Director John S. Pistole said the bureau is `` doing a complete scrub of all resources '' to ensure that enough agents are assigned to corporate investigations . 
Prompted by the government 's bank bailouts and mounting taxpayer anger , Democrats have introduced two bills in recent weeks to fund the hiring of more agents and prosecutors to combat mortgage fraud and financial wrongdoing . 
Any government crackdown on financial malfeasance is likely to tap into corporate resources , given the drain of years-long investigations on tight federal budgets . 
Many of the Justice Department 's largest ongoing fraud inquiries appear to be months if not years from reaching their targets , lawyers said yesterday . 
It is far easier for department officials to deputize companies to hire law firms and bear the cost of investigations of themselves . 
The companies are encouraged to turn over the results to the government , along with evidence against employees complicit in accounting fraud or other schemes . 
That strategy has alienated some judges who argue that employers have sacrificed individuals to secure better deals for their companies . 
It also could rile lawmakers who already have put the Justice Department on notice about protecting employee rights . 
While President Obama has decried corporate greed and fraud in recent weeks and during the presidential campaign , it is too early to know how his administration will approach such cases , and Holder has been difficult to read . 
`` We 're not going to go out on any witch hunts , and yet we 'll drill down and see '' what evidence exists of fraud and other crimes , the attorney general told reporters after being sworn in last week . 
Holder 's experience on both sides of the courtroom adds to interest in the legal community about how he will tackle the issue . 
A decade ago , after Holder , who was deputy attorney general at the time , heard persistent complaints from corporate defense lawyers , he enlisted a group of government lawyers to draft guidelines for prosecutors handling business cases . 
The Holder memo instructed lawyers to take into account a company 's cooperation with authorities in deciding whether to bring an indictment . 
The government wields substantial leverage in negotiations , because even the threat of criminal charges can put some companies out of business , as happened to accounting firm Arthur Andersen more than six years ago . 
In 2001 , Holder left government and moved into a lucrative career in private law practice , conducting investigations for companies and then sharing the results with prosecutors in exchange for leniency . 
Holder is not the only senior Justice Department official with experience defending corporate America . 
David W. Ogden , who is nominated to serve as the department 's second in command , represented media companies , government contractors and technology firms while in private practice . 
And Lanny A. Breuer , the nominee to lead the department 's criminal division , defended a host of businesses and individuals . 
New Justice Department officials are still considering their options for policing corporate fraud . 
Among the questions is whether to create a national task force to standardize decisions about what criminal charges and prison sentences to pursue in cases against employees at mortgage companies and financial institutions , said Rita M. Glavin , acting chief of the department 's criminal division . 
But authorities appear to sense that interest in the issue is peaking as the economy suffers . 
Ogden told senators at his confirmation hearing last week that on his watch , the department would undertake a `` strong , law enforcement response '' to crime on Wall Street . 
`` Serving jail time may well be an appropriate result , and it could be a deterrent in the future , '' he said .

"Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair told Congress yesterday that instability in countries around the world caused by the current global economic crisis , rather than terrorism , is the primary near-term security threat to the United States . 
`` Roughly a quarter of the countries in the world have already experienced low-level instability such as government changes because of the current slowdown , '' Blair told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , delivering the first annual threat assessment in six years in which terrorism was not presented as the primary danger to this country . 
Making his first appearance before the panel as President Obama 's top intelligence adviser , Blair said the most immediate fallout from the worldwide economic decline for the United States will be `` allies and friends not being able to fully meet their defense and humanitarian obligations . '' 
He also saw the prospect of possible refugee flows from the Caribbean to the United States and a questioning of American economic and financial leadership in the world . 
But Blair also raised the specter of the `` high levels of violent extremism '' in the turmoil of the 1920s and 1930s along with `` regime-threatening instability '' if the economic crisis persists over a one-to-two-year period . 
In answer to a question about whether he was shifting assets to cover the financial downturn , Blair said that by leading off with the economic situation he `` was trying to act as your intelligence officer today , telling you what I thought the Senate ought to be caring about . '' 
He said he was not refocusing the intelligence community 's basic collection and analytic work from traditional concerns such as terrorism , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran , North Korea , Russia and China . 
In fact , during the nearly two-hour hearing , Blair took lawmakers on a virtual tour of every other major and minor security threat , from terrorism and cyber-attacks to the country 's evolving relations with Russia and China . 
Discussing terrorism , Blair emphasized the progress being made against al-Qaeda . 
`` We have seen notable progress in Muslim opinion turning against terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda '' as more religious leaders question terrorists ' use of brutal tactics against fellow Muslims . 
He said that `` al-Qaeda today is less capable and effective than it was a year ago '' based on the pressure the U.S. , Pakistan and others put on Osama bin Laden and his core leadership in Pakistan 's tribal areas and the decline of al-Qaeda in Iraq . 
He also reported that while no major country faces the risk of collapse at the hands of any terrorist groups , `` Pakistan and Afghanistan have to work hard to repulse a still serious threat '' to their governments . 
Despite these successes , Blair said al-Qaeda and its affiliates and allies `` remain dangerous and adaptive enemies , '' and the threat continues that they could inspire or orchestrate an attack on the United States or Europe . 
He told the committee there is still concern that al-Qaeda could inspire some homegrown terrorists inside the United States . 
He added that if al-Qaeda is forced out of the Pakistan tribal areas , it will have difficulty supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan . 
He said bin Laden could relocate . 
For example , he said , al-Qaeda elements in Yemen now pose a new threat to Saudi Arabia , whose own efforts have been successful in killing or capturing most al-Qaeda senior leaders in that country . 
Blair delivered a blunt assessment of Iran and its weapons programs , saying that it is possible that Tehran could develop a nuclear weapon as early as next year , if the country 's leaders choose to do so . 
But he also suggested that Iran could be kept off the nuclear path with the right combination of diplomacy and economic pressure . 
`` Iran is clearly developing all the components of a deliverable nuclear weapons program , '' he said , but `` whether they take it all the way to nuclear weapons depends a great deal on their internal decisions . '' 
Blair described Iraq as increasingly stable , with terrorist attacks on the wane and al-Qaeda losing followers and influence . 
But he warned that recent progress could be undermined by tribal disputes , corruption and foreign support for militia groups . 
Echoing recent statements by U.S. military commanders , he gave a grim portrayal of security in Afghanistan , where Taliban insurgents have shown new aggressiveness while the government continues to struggle with rampant corruption and an extensive drug trade . 
In neighboring Pakistan , an intensified campaign against terrorists has failed to subdue multiple insurgencies or quell growing radicalism in many parts of the country .

"With the final vote coming late in the night , Congress yesterday approved a $ 787 billion stimulus package that aims to spur millions of jobs through massive new investments in energy , transportation , education and health-care projects , while reviving social safety-net programs that have been shrinking for nearly three decades . 
The bill passed the House 246 to 183 and , in a vote held open for several hours , the Senate 60 to 38 , both largely along party lines . 
President Obama is expected to sign it into law early next week . 
The legislation represents the start of a new ideological era that places the federal government at the center of the nation 's economic recovery . 
It also provides a down payment on much of President Obama 's domestic agenda , including his pledges to upgrade the nation 's aging roads , bridges and electricity grid ; overhaul health-care record-keeping and invest billions in alternative energy research to reverse climate change and wean the country from foreign oil . 
The passage is an early triumph for Obama , even though he was able to attract only three Republican senators to sign on to an effort that he once hoped would pass with large majorities from both parties . 
Nevertheless , the White House and Democratic congressional leaders were able to move what became an 1,100-page bill from first draft to final passage in less than a month , keeping to the ambitious timetable they set . 
The package combines tax cuts with new spending , and three-quarters of the money is planned to reach state capitals , businesses and individual taxpayers by the end of September 2010 . 
Its virtues and limitations will remain uncertain until the money is paid out in the form of road projects , unemployment checks and energy-efficient building improvements , but its reach is already clear . 
The New Deal of the 1930s equaled no more than 2 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product . 
The new legislation represents over 5 percent and is probably no more than an opening bid -- Obama and his congressional allies will next turn to the foreclosure crisis , the reform of financial markets and an overhaul of federal budget practices . 
`` Passing this plan is a critical step , '' Obama said at the White House yesterday morning . 
`` But as important as it is , it 's only the beginning of what we must do to turn our economy around . '' 
Republicans were scornful of the legislation , depicting it as pork-laden and ineffective . 
`` This bill is supposed to be about jobs , jobs , jobs , and it 's turned into nothing more than spend , spend , spend , '' said House Minority Leader John A. Boehner -LRB- R-Ohio -RRB- . 
White House officials predict the measure will create 3.5 million jobs over the next year and a half , easing the effects of the worst economic downturn in a generation . 
Some private analysts said the slimmed-down measure is likely to fall well short of that goal , creating fewer than 2.5 million jobs and leaving the unemployment rate over 9 percent through 2010 . 
They also cautioned that even if the package boosts economic activity , conditions are likely to continue to deteriorate unless the administration finds a way to thaw frozen credit markets and revive the paralyzed banking system . 
`` The financial crisis we 're battling against is extreme , and if we ca n't start to get the financial crisis under control , then whatever we do on the fiscal side is n't going to help that much , '' said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist at the private consulting firm Global Insight . 
Among the stimulus 's chief beneficiaries are people who are unemployed or otherwise struggling through the downturn . 
Its hefty investments in Medicaid and education troubled even some moderate Democrats for their degree of federal intervention and helped to mobilize a group of Senate centrists to cut $ 100 billion from the bill .

"Wednesday , February 18 , 2009 ; 10:18 AM The deep contraction in the economy and in the housing market has created devastating consequences for homeowners and communities throughout the country . 
Millions of responsible families who make their monthly payments and fulfill their obligations have seen their property values fall , and are now unable to refinance at lower mortgage rates . 
Millions of workers have lost their jobs or had their hours cut back , are now struggling to stay current on their mortgage payments with nearly 6 million households facing possible foreclosure . 
Neighborhoods are struggling , as each foreclosed home reduces nearby property values by as much as 9 percent . 
The Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan is part of the President 's broad , comprehensive strategy to get the economy back on track . 
The plan will help up to 7 to 9 million families restructure or refinance their mortgages to avoid foreclosure . 
In doing so , the plan not only helps responsible homeowners on the verge of defaulting , but prevents neighborhoods and communities from being pulled over the edge too , as defaults and foreclosures contribute to falling home values , failing local businesses , and lost jobs . 
The key components of the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan are : 1 . 
Affordability : Provide Access to Low-Cost Refinancing for Responsible Homeowners Suffering From Falling Home Prices Enabling Up to 4 to 5 Million Responsible Homeowners to Refinance : Mortgage rates are currently at historically low levels , providing homeowners with the opportunity to reduce their monthly payments by refinancing . 
But under current rules , most families who owe more than 80 percent of the value of their homes have a difficult time refinancing . 
Yet millions of responsible homeowners who put money down and made their mortgage payments on time have -- through no fault of their own -- seen the value of their homes drop low enough to make them unable to access these lower rates . 
As a result , the Obama Administration is announcing a new program that will help as many as 4 to 5 million responsible homeowners who took out conforming loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to refinance through those two institutions . 
Reducing Monthly Payments : For many families , a low-cost refinancing could reduce mortgage payments by thousands of dollars per year : Consider a family that took out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $ 207,000 with an interest rate of 6.50 % on a house worth $ 260,000 at the time . 
Today , that family has about $ 200,000 remaining on their mortgage , but the value of that home has fallen 15 percent to $ 221,000 -- making them ineligible for today 's low interest rates that now generally require the borrower to have 20 percent home equity . 
Under this refinancing plan , that family could refinance to a rate near 5.16 % -- reducing their annual payments by over $ 2,300 . 
Stability : Create A $ 75 Billion Homeowner Stability Initiative to Reach Up to 3 to 4 Million At-Risk Homeowners Helping Hard-Pressed Homeowners Stay in their Homes : This initiative is intended to reach millions of responsible homeowners who are struggling to afford their mortgage payments because of the current recession , yet can not sell their homes because prices have fallen so significantly . 
Millions of hard-working families have seen their mortgage payments rise to 40 or even 50 percent of their monthly income -- particularly those who received subprime and exotic loans with exploding terms and hidden fees . 
The Homeowner Stability Initiative helps those who commit to make reasonable monthly mortgage payments to stay in their homes -- providing families with security and neighborhoods with stability . 
No Aid for Speculators : This initiative will go solely to helping homeowners who commit to make payments to stay in their home it will not aid speculators or house flippers .

"MESA , Ariz. , Feb. 18 -- President Obama unveiled a foreclosure-prevention package Wednesday that would pour more than $ 75 billion into arresting one of the root causes of the nation 's economic spiral by helping as many as 9 million homeowners obtain more affordable mortgage terms . 
The package , part of the Obama administration 's multibillion-dollar effort to jolt the nation out of its deepening recession , goes beyond what some analysts had expected and was welcomed by many of the nation 's top lending institutions . 
But it also drew criticism from some housing experts and consumer advocates , who argued that it does not go far enough in addressing some critical aspects of the foreclosure crisis . 
Many key details of the plan will not be released until early next month . 
Speaking to a crowd packed into a high school gymnasium here , Obama said the mortgage plan would help all Americans confronted with rapidly eroding property values by helping those in danger of losing their homes . 
`` The plan I 'm announcing focuses on rescuing families who have played by the rules and acted responsibly , by refinancing loans for millions of families in traditional mortgages who are underwater or close to it , '' he said . 
The three key elements of the proposal include a program that would allow 4 million to 5 million homeowners with little equity in their homes to refinance into cheaper mortgages ; a $ 75 billion program to keep 3 million to 4 million homeowners out of foreclosure ; and a doubling of the government 's commitment to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to $ 400 billion . 
It is the largest federal foreclosure-prevention package in decades , and it would rely on a series of incentives to jump-start fledgling efforts to keep millions of distressed borrowers in their homes . 
It is the first major government program aimed at homeowners who are current on their loans , and it would require large banks that have received government bailout money to abide by industry standards for loan modifications established by the Obama administration . 
About one in 10 homeowners were delinquent on their mortgages late last year , and as many as 6 million homes could go into foreclosure during the next three years without this program , said Shaun Donovan , secretary of housing and urban development , adding : `` We believe we can help a very large share of these . '' 
The administration estimates that simply by reducing foreclosures , the plan could stop the slide in home prices by as much as $ 6,000 per property . 
`` The effects of this crisis have also reverberated across the financial markets . 
When the housing market collapsed , so did the availability of credit on which our economy depends , '' Obama said . 
`` As that credit has dried up , it has been harder for families to find affordable loans to purchase a car or pay tuition , and harder for businesses to secure the capital they need to expand and create jobs . '' 
While some of the measures Obama announced can be implemented by government regulators , others will require congressional approval . 
For example , a key part of the package includes legislation that would bankruptcy law to allow judges to modify the mortgages of distressed homeowners , including by reducing the principal of the loan to the property 's current market value . 
While broad , the package does not tackle some key issues , critics said , noting that it does not include a plan for dealing with second mortgages , which often become a stumbling block for mortgage-modification programs . 
Others pointed out that for many lenders , the program would be voluntary . 
`` This is a major step forward to addressing the foreclosure crisis , '' said John Taylor , president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition . 
`` But the plan may not be aggressive enough . 
While the plan offers sweeteners to encourage lenders and homeowners to participate , its voluntary nature may blunt its impact . ''

"SEC to Examine Boards ' Role in Financial Crisis SEC chairman Mary Schapiro may ask boards to disclose more about the backgrounds of its directors . 
-LRB- By Jose Luis Magana -- Associated Press -RRB- Your browser 's settings may be preventing you from commenting on and viewing comments about this item . 
See instructions for fixing the problem . 
Friday , February 20 , 2009 ; Page D01 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro plans to look into whether the boards of banks and other financial firms conducted effective oversight leading up to the financial crisis , according to SEC officials , part of efforts to intensify scrutiny of the top levels of management and give new powers to shareholders to shape boards . 
As she examines what went wrong , Schapiro is also considering asking boards to disclose more about directors ' backgrounds and skills , specifically how much they know about managing risk , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because no policy initiative has been launched . 
Having led the agency for just three weeks , Schapiro has n't had the chance to move forward on these initiatives , though that will probably be one of her first tasks . 
Schapiro has said that Wall Street must repair itself after the financial crisis and that one way to do so is by `` giving shareholders a greater say on who serves on corporate boards , and how company executives are paid . '' 
With few exceptions , boards have received little media attention as the country has sought explanations for financial firms ' taking on such perilous risks . 
These boards -- which typically consist of a dozen or more well-known executives , politicians and other influential people -- were ultimately responsible for the decisions of the Wall Street companies , housing firms and banks at the heart of the crisis . 
The boards signed off on the risks the companies took and the compensation packages awarded to top executives . 
But many corporate watchdogs say the boards of top financial firms had characteristics that promoted risky business practices and harmed shareholders . 
`` Corporate governance is about managing risk . 
It 's about incentive compensation . 
It 's about corporate strategy and sustainability . 
And all of those things are what the boards failed to do , '' said Nell Minow , a co-founder of the Corporate Library and an advocate of reforming corporate boards . 
The Obama administration and Congress have already taken steps to limit the type of board behavior that may have contributed to the crisis . 
The stimulus legislation includes limits on compensation at companies receiving tax dollars as well as provisions that give shareholders an advisory vote on executive compensation , known as `` say on pay . '' 
Most boards have committees to oversee risk and compensation , and corporate watchdogs say their biggest failure was allowing executives to be paid in exchange for the quantity of business rather than the quality . 
This often promoted short-term risk-taking at the expense of long-term gains . 
`` Management and traders are compensated on booking profits . 
It did n't take a long time to figure out if you undertake very risky activities , you get higher bonuses , '' said Ivo Welch , professor of finance and economics at Brown University . 
`` There 's nobody to say this is not in the interest of shareholders or the United States overall . '' 
Watchdogs point to flawed boards at many firms -- including Countrywide , American International Group and Wachovia -- involved in the crisis . 
Minow points out that at Bear Stearns , the compensation committee had nine criteria to decide on the chief executive 's compensation , such as total return to shareholders and earnings per share . 
But in the end , it could choose to award the maximum compensation to the chief executive based on only one of the criteria . 
Over five years at Bear Stearns , chief executive James E. Cayne took home $ 155 million , according to Forbes . 
A few months after Cayne stepped down as chief , a collapsing Bear Stearns was snapped up by J.P. Morgan in a federally engineered fire sale in which shareholders lost most of their investment . 
The Bear Stearns board had other characteristics that corporate governance advocates found problematic . 
For example , several directors served on the boards of four public companies , raising questions about whether they had the time to oversee a complex financial firm .

"'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | BEIJING -- The global financial crisis is bringing out the worst in the trade relationship between the United States and China . 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner accused China of `` manipulating '' its currency , vowing in written testimony submitted for his confirmation hearing that the United States would act `` aggressively '' to remedy the situation . 
The U.S. Trade Representative 's office , in a harshly worded and wide-ranging complaint to the World Trade Organization in December , alleged that China uses cash grants , cheap loans and other subsidies to illegally aid its exporters . 
China , for its part , has bashed the `` Buy America '' program embedded in the just-passed stimulus package , calling it `` poison to the solution '' of the global economic crisis . 
At the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos three weeks ago , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , without naming the United States explicitly , blamed the financial crisis on unsupervised capitalism . 
`` The crisis has pushed the China-U.S. relationship to a flash point . 
From now on , it will either become more stable or more confrontational , '' said Mei Xinyu , a trade expert with the Chinese Commerce Ministry 's research arm . 
When Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives in China on Friday as part of her first diplomatic visit as secretary of state , she said she hopes to broaden the bilateral dialogue to include climate change and human rights . 
But it is economic cooperation that will be at the forefront of many people 's minds . 
Both the United States and China , the world 's No. 1 and No. 3 largest economies , have railed about the dangers of economic protectionism , but so far both have been guilty , according to the other , of practicing it . 
`` While both countries have come to an agreement that trade protectionism should n't be practiced by any country , when it comes to the details -- maybe due to domestic reasons -- they may feel pressured toward it , '' said Jia Qingguo , the vice dean of Peking University 's international studies school . 
Li Wei , a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation , said `` the purpose of ` Buy America ' is clearly to kick out foreign competitors . '' 
In the United States , industry groups are pushing for more action against China , saying it is trying to export its way out of the crisis by dumping cheap products abroad . 
The latest figures , released in mid-February , show that the U.S. trade deficit with China hit at an all-time high of $ 266.3 billion in 2008 , the worst imbalance ever recorded with any country . 
It came as the overall trade deficit shrank for the year and hit its lowest levels in six years in December amid depressed demand for imports . 
U.S. steel and textile manufacturers have been especially loud in their call for the Obama administration to be more aggressive with Beijing . 
The U.S. International Trade Commission has imposed duties of 35 to 40 percent on some steel products from China -- imports hit an all-time high this fall -- to counteract Chinese subsidies . 
The textile lobby has accused China of increasing its share of the U.S. apparel market to more than 50 percent this year by using export subsidies . 
The Dec. 19 WTO petition filed by the USTR addresses some of these concerns ; a WTO official said the complaint is still being reviewed .

"Trouble Trickles From Steep Drop in Oil Prices A worker monitors an automated manifold as it directs oil in Cushing , Okla. -LRB- By Shane Bevel -- Bloomberg News -RRB- The precipitous fall in the price of oil in recent months , while good for consumers , has contributed to the confusion in the global economy , wreaking havoc with the budgets and economies of oil-exporting nations and putting many expensive energy projects on hold . 
In Canada , where President Obama visited yesterday , the drop in oil prices has done more to slow development of controversial oil sands projects than the protests of environmental groups , who note that the energy-intensive process of mining those sands contributes to global warming . 
Executives in the past have said oil must cost $ 60 to $ 90 a barrel to justify the investment . 
In Kuwait this month , the government unveiled a $ 5 billion rescue plan for banks , pledging to guarantee 50 percent of new loans to ease a credit crunch in the oil-rich nation . 
The country 's biggest investment bank , Global Investment House , said last month it had defaulted on most of its debt , while an Islamic rival said in December it needed up to $ 1 billion in loans . 
Russia , which last year was flush with oil and gas revenue , bolstered its deteriorating financial position this week by promising to supply China with 300,000 barrels a day of Siberian oil over the next 20 years in return for $ 25 billion in loans to Russian state-owned oil and pipeline firms with large debt payments coming due this year . 
In Venezuela , Hugo Ch vez won a referendum that would allow him to extend his presidency . 
But Ch vez , who became president during widespread discontent in 1998 when oil prices were extremely low , must deal with an oil slump of his own . 
Oil accounts for 95 percent of exports and about half of fiscal revenue , analysts say . 
`` The last five years saw the rebirth of the use of oil as a critical instrument of foreign policy by key resource countries , Iran , Russia and Venezuela in particular , '' said Ed Morse , managing director and chief economist of LCM Research . 
`` With oil and natural gas prices having collapsed , the power of their weapons has been waning rapidly , turning creditor into debtor nations and depriving them of the revenue required to fulfill their international goals . '' 
Just one year ago , the price of oil finished trading at more than $ 100 a barrel for the first time , fueling speculation about a new era of oil prices . 
Yesterday , oil finished trading in New York at $ 39.15 a barrel , and that after surging 13 percent for the day . 
The overwhelming cause of the collapse in oil prices has been the faltering world economy , which has fueled the drop in consumption . 
Oil use in China , which most forecasters a year ago assumed would be the engine for increasing global demand , has screeched to a halt . 
Paul Ting , an independent oil analyst , says preliminary estimates suggest that petroleum consumption in China fell more than 6 percent in January compared with the month in 2008 . 
Crude oil imports hit a 14-month low , he said . 
In the United States , where passenger vehicles use about one of nine barrels produced worldwide , strapped motorists in December traveled less than they did a year ago , even though gasoline prices are more than $ 1 a gallon cheaper . 
The Federal Highway Administration said it was the 14th consecutive month in which American motorists drove fewer miles . 
In 2008 , U.S. motorists drove 3.6 percent less , or 107.9 billion fewer miles , than in 2007 , the FHA said . 
Total miles driven , which normally rise every year with the population and number of cars on the road , fell slightly below 2004 levels . 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has cut production three times since September . 
It plans to meet again March 15 , and senior officials of the cartel said additional cuts in output are likely . 
But OPEC has been having trouble keeping up with shrinking global demand .

"A looming financial crisis in Eastern Europe is fast depleting International Monetary Fund reserves , fueling tensions between the wealthy but cash-strapped countries that have traditionally controlled it and emerging economies that have the resources to shore it up . 
The faltering economies of Eastern Europe were on the minds of European leaders as they met in Berlin over the weekend . 
They called for doubling the IMF 's resources , to $ 500 billion , to cope with crises spawned by the worldwide recession . 
Since last fall , the IMF has lent more than $ 30 billion to Hungary , Belarus , Latvia , Serbia and Ukraine . 
All have been hurt by collapsing demand for exports ; foreign investors who have pulled back sharply , partly to cover losses at home ; and falling currency values . 
And some may be coming back for more . 
World Bank officials warned last week that if wealthier countries in Europe fail to help Eastern Europe , economic and political gains made in the region since the fall of the Soviet Union could be erased . 
Economic distress has already led to the collapse of the government in Latvia , where riots broke out last month . 
Riots also have taken place in Bulgaria and Lithuania . 
Additional countries are expected to turn to the IMF for help as the crisis deepens , raising concerns about the fund 's adequacy . 
IMF officials said there is n't reason to worry -- yet . 
At this stage , IMF officials said , doubling the fund 's lending capacity , which stood at $ 250 billion before the crisis , to $ 500 billion is sufficient to ensure confidence in the adequacy of the Fund 's resources . 
Including the Eastern European loans , along with loans to Iceland and Pakistan , the IMF has lent about $ 50 billion , bringing its lending capacity down to $ 200 billion . 
Recently , Japan committed an additional $ 100 billion . 
But several analysts doubted that that would be enough if the global downturn lasts well into 2010 , as expected . 
`` What we 're now talking about is a global crisis , many countries in many parts of the world . 
And larger economies , '' said Fredrik Erixon , director of the European Centre for International Political Economy in Brussels . 
`` There 's no chance at all the IMF could be part of a bigger bailout of several big economies at same time . '' 
While some leaders have said they would be willing to help bail out Eastern European neighbors , by calling for other countries to help the IMF bulk up its reserves , they acknowledged that they might not be able to raise the necessary funds for economic and political reasons , analysts said . 
Countries such as Germany and France , along with the United States , already are spending at least tens of billions of dollars to turn around their own economies . 
`` I think politically , it would go down easier for German public opinion to channel the money to Central and Eastern Europe through the IMF , rather than giving money directly to country XYZ , '' said Lars Christensen , chief emerging markets analyst at Danske Bank . 
But coming up with additional money for the IMF poses challenges . 
Countries such as China and the oil-rich Gulf states , which have the resources to contribute , have been reluctant to do so because they have little decision-making power under rules that favor Europe and the United States , which set up the IMF in 1945 . 
They have long complained about the disparity between their voting power within the IMF and growing economic clout . 
In a position paper released earlier this month in preparation for the G-20 summit in April , Chinese officials said developing countries should have more voting power .

"Obama Outlines His Plans for Economic Recovery In a speech to a joint session of Congress , President Barack Obama tells America , `` we will rebuild , we will recover . '' 
"
"Obama addresses Congress last night . 
-LRB- AP Photo\/Pablo Martinez Monsivais -RRB- Simply by being there , President Obama and Vice President Biden created powerful imagery of change at last night 's joint session of Congress . 
There was no Dick Cheney skulking over the president 's right shoulder . 
Gone was the tongue-tied Texan staring blankly into the TelePrompter , replaced by a commanding and self-possessed African-American Democrat . 
And up there in the first lady 's box ? 
A radiant black woman . 
But sometimes bygones wo n't be bygones . 
Indeed , absolutely central to Obama 's argument last night for his massive economic recovery package and his hugely ambitious plans in the areas of energy , health and education was his conclusion that the previous administration so utterly failed to rise to the challenges facing the nation that we are now facing `` a day of reckoning . '' 
Here 's the transcript , as delivered . 
Obama went into last night 's address with enormous popular support . 
But he still needed to turn the country 's faith in him into faith in his far-reaching agenda . 
To fully make the case for such dramatic action , he had to more clearly explain his thought process . 
He did that in three fundamental steps . 
First , by describing the profound irresponsibility that brought us here in the first place . 
Then by reminding us that the American government has a history of achieving greatness in times of crisis . 
Then by hearkening to this country 's indomitable spirit . 
It was a potent combination . 
And that first part amounted to possibly the most damning summary of the Bush legacy yet . 
`` The fact is , our economy did not fall into decline overnight . 
Nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank , '' Obama said . 
`` We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy , yet we import more oil today than ever before . 
The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year , yet we keep delaying reform . 
Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for . 
And though all of these challenges went unsolved , we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt , both as individuals and through our government , than ever before . 
`` In other words , we have lived through an era where too often short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity , where we failed to look beyond the next payment , the next quarter , or the next election . 
A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future . 
Regulations -- regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market . 
People bought homes they knew they could n't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway . 
And all the while , critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day . 
`` Well , that day of reckoning has arrived , and the time to take charge of our future is here . 
`` Now is the time to act boldly and wisely , to not only revive this economy , but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity . '' 
Since the day after the election , Obama has been accused of overreaching . 
But in what I consider the second major part of his central argument , he argued that now is not the time to think small : `` I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves , that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity , for history tells a different story , '' he said . 
`` History reminds us that , at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation , this nation has responded with bold action and big ideas . 
In the midst of civil war , we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry . 
From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age . 
In the wake of war and depression , the G.I. Bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle-class in history . 
And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways , an American on the moon , and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world . 
`` In each case , government did n't supplant private enterprise ; it catalyzed private enterprise . 
It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive . 
`` We are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed opportunity from ordeal . 
Now we must be that nation again . 
`` That is why , even as it cuts back on programs we do n't need , the budget I submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future : energy , health care , and education . '' 
And Obama made the third part of his central argument with the help of a Skutnik -- one of the carefully-selected guests in the first lady 's box that presidents have held out as examples to the nation ever since Ronald Reagan in 1982 lauded Lenny Skutnik , the government worker who weeks before had leapt into the icy Potomac River to rescue a survivor of an Air Florida crash . 
Obama 's chief Skutnik was Ty'Sheoma Bethea , an eighth-grade student from a crumbling junior high school in South Carolina . 
`` She had been told that her school is hopeless , '' Obama explained . 
`` But the other day after class , she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this chamber . 
She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp . 
`` The letter asks us for help and says , ` We are just students trying to become lawyers , doctors , congressmen like yourself , and one day president , so we can make a change to not just the state of South Carolina , but also the world . 
We are not quitters . ' 
`` That 's what she said : ` We are not quitters . ' 
These words -- -LRB- APPLAUSE . -RRB- 
These words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here . 
They tell us that , even in the most trying times , amid the most difficult circumstances , there is a generosity , a resilience , a decency , and a determination that perseveres , a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity . 
`` Their resolve must be our inspiration . 
Their concerns must be our cause . 
And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us . '' 
Of his three major priorities , Obama was most emphatic about health care . 
Almost shouting , he declared : '' -LRB- L -RRB- et there be no doubt : Health care reform can not wait , it must not wait , and it will not wait another year . '' 
He also responded to several populist concerns about his financial rescue plan . 
Notably , he placed a good deal of distance between himself and how the Bush administration apportioned the first chunk of bailout money : `` Now , I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks , Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that followed . 
So were the American taxpayers ; so was I. `` So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now , especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions . 
I promise you : I get it . 
But I also know that , in a time of crisis , we can not afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment . '' 
He vowed : `` This time -- this time , CEOs wo n't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks , or buy fancy drapes , or disappear on a private jet . 
Those days are over . '' 
And he offered one big reason to discount the largely negative judgment of Wall Street on his bank rescue plan thus far : `` I understand that , on any given day , Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives bank bailouts with no strings attached and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions , but such an approach wo n't solve the problem . '' 
Obama defended his anti-foreclosure plan , alluding to the fact that it wo n't cover investors or people who ca n't make even reduced payments : `` It 's a plan that wo n't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford , but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values , Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped to bring about . '' 
And he identified some modest cuts he intends to make in his budget , including `` direct payments to large agribusinesses that do n't need them , '' `` no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq , '' and `` Cold War-era weapons systems we do n't use . '' 
He said he would raise taxes by ending tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans : `` Let me be absolutely clear , because I know you 'll end up hearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people . 
If your family earns less than $ 250,000 a year , a quarter million dollars a year , you will not see your taxes increased a single dime . 
I repeat : not one single dime . '' 
One of the biggest surprises of the night was his rousing call for individuals to pursue their schooling . '' 
-LRB- D -RRB- ropping out of high school is no longer an option . 
It 's not just quitting on yourself ; it 's quitting on your country , '' he said , also asking `` every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training . '' 
He also asked Congress `` to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution . '' 
There were only a few lines in his speech that actively pit the two sides of the aisle against each other . 
One came when Obama spoke of the importance of drawing down the debt . 
`` See , I know we can get some consensus in here , '' Obama ad-libbed . 
But when he returned to his text -- saying `` With the deficit we inherited ... '' -- it was the Democrats ' turn to roar . 
And rather than explicitly reaching out to Republicans on any particular issue , Obama chose instead to speak more generally about common ground : `` I know that we have n't agreed on every issue thus far , '' he said . 
`` There are surely times in the future where we will part ways . 
But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed . 
That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months and where we return after those debates are done . 
That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground . '' 
By Dan Froomkin | February 25 , 2009 ; 12:08 PM ET Thanks , Dan . 
This is the first review of the President 's address that makes sense to me . 
Other commenters seem to be more interested in the response in the polls or crabbing about their pet peeves . 
My reaction to the speech was that the President put Congress on notice that it better not get in his way or those who oppose his policies will face political death . 
The Nation rightly stands behind him to face the challenges ahead . 
I cried out as Pelosi jumped to her feet for the thousandth time . 
I thought she was trying to steal the spotlight or perhaps to bask in his glow -- either way it was not appealing . 
And the same old back and forth between the two sides of the house seemed dreadfully inappropriate -- very adolescent -- a kind of Terrel Owens approach to politics . 
A Bronx cheer to congresspeople on both sides of the aisle . 
It was an ambitious speech . 
It will be interesting to see how much actually gets accomplished . 
Where , exactly , is the analysis here ? 
I thought I would check out one column in the post-Bush era to see if Froomkin could get over his snide lunacy and actually honestly live up to the name of this column `` White House Watch . '' 
Mission failed , Dan . 
At least I wo n't have to read you ever again , so thanks for sparing me those few minutes . 
He was raised as a Hindu but now says he 's a Christian . 
Do you think he 's a stealth Christian and that his inner Hindu is lying in wait ? 
Who is the real Piyush Jindal ? 
Who 's he been palin ' around with ? 
His speech reminded me of the infamous McCain `` lime green '' speech in Philadelphia in response to Obama 's nomination . 
`` That 's not change we can believe in ! 
-LRB- grin grin -RRB- '' When Obama came down the gauntlet and met Richard Shelby I expected him to pull out his birth certificate to show Shelby during their amicable chat . 
Cut those taxes , that 's all we need . 
It worked so well the last eight years . 
Where did Froomkin demonstrate snide lunacy in covering Bush ? 
I do n't see what 's wrong with contrasting the present administration with the previous administration 2 months in . 
I 'm glad I wo n't have to waste 10 seconds reading any more of your inane comments . 
Anyway , I agree on the whole standing ovation issue . 
At least Obama seems to be consistently following his theme of not avoiding tough decisions . 
He is n't going to put off energy issues , education or health care reform simply because they are divisive . 
One of my usual thinly-disguised-nasty incoming e-mails this morning was of the typical `` yes , but ... '' variety . 
Guy made a silly faint attempt at portraying himself as bipartisan , then got down to the same old stuff . 
He pointed out that the stock market is continuing to fall under Obama . 
This is an administration that has been at the helm for all of 5 weeks ... and my blindly conservative acquaintance wants to totally dismiss from consideration the Bush years that effected the present near-terminal bleeding of the stock market ! 
He 's found a way in his own mind to blame everything on Barack Obama . 
Our Congress appears to be a microcosm of the American public at large , what with its mule-headed , heels-dug-in , self-absorbed conservatives . 
Obstructionism is pursued with a sort of vengeance -- as if the Bush years were `` the good old days . '' 
Personally , I 'm in my 81st year , and this is the best president I 've seen yet -- back to and including Franklin Roosevelt . 
That 's rich !! try every column ever written . 
Now we get the man crush articles . 
Oh obama looked at me !! oh obama shook my hand , I will never wash it again ! 
Oh Obama looked my way ! 
Froomkin is a joke only good for laughs ... Posted by : pwaa | February 25 , 2009 2:44 PM | Report abuse '' Personally , I 'm in my 81st year , and this is the best president I 've seen yet -- back to and including Franklin Roosevelt . '' 
well grandpa time to take your meds apparently . 
FDR , who defeated the Nazis and Japanese , served for 4 terms , tackled the depression ? 
And after 5 weeks , Obama is his equal ? 
What idiocy Posted by : pwaa | February 25 , 2009 2:47 PM | Report abuse Last nights address may be the most honest speak given to congress since Ford 's speech . 
The speech where he said the state of the country was not good . 
Well that was 35 years ago and the state of affairs are in the ditch again . 
We need mules to pull us out , not muleheaded stubborness keeping us there . 
We should leave the nit pickers in the dust as the majority of us try to move forward . 
For god 's sake any bill drafted in Congress will have a few flea 's . 
The last 8 years of tax breaks to the top 2 % and job 's being done away with for the remaining 98 % just do n't seen to be working . 
It is a time for a new begining , a new dawn . 
Last night was the latest shot across the bow for the future . 
The chat today was cool , too . 
Looks like bobmoses\/Pugi\/PWAA needs a nap . 
There are rather deranged mental defectives who support the blue blooded aristocrat elitist crime family booschie . 
These would be known as traitors , warmongers , thuggish bullies , juvenile loudmouths , and loathsome racist class war artists . 
You disagree with a person 's views -- lay it on . 
But when you attack a person because of their age -LRB- in this case -RRB- , race , or gender , you step over a line which should not be tolerated in a civil society . 
Back under the bridge , troll ! 
That has never been a long suit with Republicans , so maybe you are a Republican . 
People who have watched a string of politicians over 80 years , and studied some actual history along the way , are in a pretty good position to judge their merits . 
I am only 72 , so I do n't have as many years invested . 
At one time early in my life I was a Goldwater conservative , but the Republican Party has lost its way and seems to be wandering in the desert . 
People like Jindal do not inspire confidence as guides to lead them out of the wilderness . 
My father , a longtime treasurer for a Republican county committee , complained about them on his deathbed , and they have gone downhill since then . 
A good hard slap to instill some respect for his elders is called for . 
What would Obama do ? 
, and how would he confront a totally hostile and obstructionist democratic house ? . 
You see people , grand ideas and plans are only that , the success or failure rests on the shoulders of everyone , the institutions that must put them in practice and many other factors . 
Former president Bush is no more responsible for the collapse of the economy , than Mr. Obama will be if his plans succeed or fail . 
To state otherwise is at best naive and at worse stupid . 
Some people even think that a speech alone will improve the economy , it reminds me of those who think that we humans can somehow change the climate . 
Give Dan a break . 
Sooner or later he will start making sense . 
Drink the kool aid , inanely walk around chanting O-BAM-A , O-BAM-A . 
Blame Bush for everything . 
Liberals are the only people who when they form a firing squad , form a circle ... . . 
Describing this important tragedy in DC history as `` an Air Florida crash '' is a bit like calling the 911 attack on the Pentagon as `` a fire in government building '' Posted by : billx2001 | February 25 , 2009 5:14 PM | Report abuse Exorcising Bush 's ghost will take years of painfully hard efforts by all Americans , unfortunately . 
That much is certain now . 
Shamefully , we have children disguised as adults who are stomping their feet in a hissy fit over the President 's refusal to keep doing the same thing over that is not working and over again expecting different results . 
That is the layman 's definition of insanity and I am a happy Kool-Aid drinker since we do n't have a President doing crazy things like cutting taxes more for the rich and letting the banks sell , well trash that we the little people have to work to pay . 
I am happy with this President ! 
Dan , YOU just keep on him because we have no loyal opposition to keep his feet to the fire we have merely a bunch of negative nabobs of negativity disguised as Republicans . 
As a born and raised Louisianan I am deeply ashamed of Gov. Jindal who merely wants to be President not a public servant . 
Folks just need to grow up ! 
Well , actually Obama 's approval rating is less than 60 % and less than Bush 's a month into office . 
If Froomkin was a journalist instead of a partisan hack , he would acknowledge this . 
We `` get it . '' 
Democrats = good , smart . 
Republicans = evil , stupid . 
Such drivel is commonplace in your missives . 
The fact is that you are incapable of being objective , or at least you have never shown the ability to be objective . 
Yet another reason why newspapers , and those who write for them , are fading into irrelevance . 
Enjoy preaching to your choir . 
While the sheeple manage to keep Obama 's approval about average for this time in his presidency , the real news -- not discussed here because it would n't support the agenda -- is that Obama 's disapproval ratings are at record levels . 
It seems that his failure to lead Pelosi and friends is beginning to alienate the centrists who put him over the top . 
Oh , and Dan , can we just quit with the `` black '' thing . 
He 's the post-racial president , remember ? 
His mother was white ! 
And the `` radiant black woman '' you speak of looked like an absolute buffoon in a sleeveless , knee-length dress in February . 
Ca n't discuss a presidential speech on the issues ? 
Each one of you that posts about Mrs. Obama , or denigrates someone 's age , or refers time and time again to the worn out `` kool aid '' simply reinforces the reputation of Republicans ; childish , petulant , and ignorant . 
President Obama 's speech was brilliant . 
It will go down in history as one of the great Presidential speeches . 
It was the right speech at the right time and he delivered it with passion . 
Some of you note that it 's all just words . 
It 's a speech . 
They call it a speech because it 's spoken . 
If it was action they would call it an activity . 
Give the President more than five weeks before you start busting a gut . 
You have eight years to go , do n't want to have blow all your arteries in the first two months now do you ? 
That being said , I must offer a few comments that are less than positive : First , I found the president 's speech to be too much a reiteration of his past speeches , both as a candidate and as president , with too much emphasis on principles and a lack of detail . 
Second , there is a contradiction that must be explained to me , and perhaps to millions of others , in that we are castigated for having lived above our means , for having made irresponsible financial decisions , based in large part on easy credit , and at the same time we are hammered with the concept that the nation 's economy is built on credit and wo n't recover until credit is less tight , i.e. , easier . 
If there is n't a contradiction here , a better explanation is necessary . 
I do sense a message , however , which is conveyed by the president 's insistence on going forward on his plans regarding education , health care , etc. . 
The message is that Mr. Obama is not here to put Humpty Dumpty back together and let things go on as before , to merely restore a business and governmental culture that continues America 's spiral of decline , softened and camouflaged by bubbles of prosperity -LRB- dotcom , housing -RRB- that pop or deflate , with devastating results . 
The nation needs Mr. Obama to succeed , not just satisfy us with the image of success . 
I wish him the best . 
The compost and most of the other liberal old media are toast . 
There might be a job opening at MSNBC , though most likely that 's toast as well . 
As far as the speech , does n't Obie do a great con job ... Posted by : steve4 | February 25 , 2009 7:55 PM | Report abuse Nice analysis of the speech . 
I especially liked when he said that dropping out of high school is n't even an option -- it would be quitting on the country . 
The Air Florida crash happened in January 1981 , not 1982 . 
Reagan invited Lenny Skutnik to the State of the Union a couple of weeks later . 
Republicans beware , if you continue to be horses arses , the people will hold you accountable and you will be further marginalized . 
Obama has a real vision for this country , the whole country , not just country club . 
Suspension of disbelief can only stretch so far . 
There is no Bush apologist on this comment board today that I can see who a sense of history . 
Had such MENSA members any sense of history , they 'd know that Dubya is Herbert Hoover . 
But without the lifelong charitable contributions and philanthropy . 
A reader of history also would know that in a deficit situation , a tax cut is not truly a cut ; it is only tax deferred . 
Rant on , professor . 
I 'm remembering that flap a few years ago when the news staff complained so much about you , and so many of us came forward to support you . 
A column like this makes them look like pompous fools . 
If this is n't real reporting , I do n't know what is . 
`` Could n't you just save some time and write `` Obama is awesome ; Bush sucked '' for every entry ? '' 
No , he ca n't . 
The job of a columnist is to point out the subtleties we might not otherwise notice . 
`` Obama is awesome ; Bush sucked '' is already obvious to everyone in the world . 
-- faye kane , homeless brain Posted by : FayeKane_HomelessSmartypants | February 25 , 2009 8:50 PM | Report abuse President Obama was a commanding presence , full of ideas , clearly conveyed . 
he told us what he was going to do , why it needed done , and how he is going to do it . 
He is dead on right . 
Since the days of reagan the nation has ignored anything difficult , with the exception of Clinton draggin republicons along a little way , albiet kicking and screaming . 
bush erased the benefits of the Clinton era in about a month , and within a year had turned a record surplus right back in to reagan like deficits . 
jindal was worse than a joke . 
Do republicons see a brown person and automatically think they can win over minority support ? 
jodal was condescending , inarticulate , creepy at times , and his message - really , tax cuts will work this time was disgraceful . 
His trying to pretend that because bush gutted FEMA that it was proof that government ca n't work . 
He is also showboating `` rejecting '' less than 3 % of the stimulus money headed to Loiusianna , omitting the fact that because Loiusianna has gotten so incredibly much federal money - 3rd largest amount of any state in the nation - already that he has the leeway to pull a stunt like that . 
Especially if it just keeps a few poor people from eating . 
Who cares about poor people in the gop anyway ? 
President Obama is the once in a lifetime leader that tends to emerge in the face of real adversity . 
Our real tragedy on 9\/11 is that we had a nincompoop in office who people sort of voted for -LRB- not as many as his opponenet , but we all know bush cheated to becaome president -RRB- based on the notion that since things were so good following the Clinton era that it did n't really matter all that much . 
Froomkin is a retard , wait that is an insult to the mentally handicapped . 
Froomie is a lightweight of epic proportions . 
His idea of a deep thought is `` Bush bad , dems good ... '' Obama has created a 2 trillion dollar deficit . 
He didnt inherit it . 
He and his fellow Dems gleefully passed every recent budget : 2007 , 2008 , now this mess . 
The next few years will be a disaster of epic proportions ! 
And it 's been years in the making ... . . 
bush has left our great nation a flaming wreck . 
The treasury is empty , the bureacracy is badly damaged , our environment has been raped , our reputation is tarnished , we fought and continue to fight a war based on what everyone on earth now knows from documented evidence was lies , he even dragged the United States down to the level of communist North korea by making torture and illegal detention and kangaroo courts national policy . 
It is not derangement to state facts . 
bush was rated 36th among presidents . 
He got such a high rating because the three criteria they used - he ranked 40th and 41st on economic and national security , inculded the bogus criteria of `` promtin equal rights '' which was not something any presdient in the 19th century would have considered their duty . 
So bush scoring 24th there pulled out of a digging match with buchanan for the basement . 
President Obama is a once in a generation , once in a lifetime phenomenon . 
republicons hate him exactly because of that . 
They know he represents the end of the road for their ideology , and he represents their being in the political wilderness for decades . 
Just like when FDR took office in 1933 following a disasterous string of years of republicon leadership . 
Joe Biden is an honorable statesmen and one that has some good accomplishment so its good to see him sitting there . 
I do wish this president the best and he is trying hard . 
If the republicans can not be of interest to be a help then shut up and sit down . 
They let their own leader and president run amuck for 8 years and put this country in a mess it may never recoup from . 
But I do look forward to seeing more of this president and family . 
I feel like the country has a real intact good family at the helm and we just got rid of a dysfunctional president that made the entire country dysfunctional . 
Mr. Froomkin and all you Obama-loving bloggers , explain the following : Dawn Johnsen as head of Treasury 's Office of Legal Council ; `` I do n't sweat ; '' `` We won ; '' and all Obama 's cabinet picks that uncovered brazen crooks . 
Your repeated and tiring insults directed to Bush are vile and illustrate a simple mind short of ideas , originality and decency . 
Froomkin 's hatred is on a par with Obama 's arrogance . 
Your hatred of Bush and your child-like adulation of a corrupt Obama are pathetic as well as pathological , Posted by : david-mckenzie | February 26 , 2009 12:43 AM | Report abuse I did n't like the new format at all , but I 'm beginning to realize it does have this good feature : all the Johnny One-notes tend to gravitate to one of the threads and leave the rest more pleasant . 
I read this blog because it makes a nice precis of editorial opinion from elsewhere , and editorials can be a great way to find out about things . 
I think it 's a high complement to the quality of Dan 's work as a journalist that there are so many lost souls who return here again and again like moths to the flame , whining about his politics . 
The poster ragging on the first lady 's frock : that is definitely the sound of a wing-nut 's head exploding . 
McCain\/Palin fan , no doubt . 
Music to my ears . 
Do n't burn out , fella . 
You 've got most of two terms left to go . 
Perhaps you watched Oliver Stone 's movie ? 
Bush , unlike Agamemnon , did not go off to war for a long absence , abandoning Froomkin -LRB- Clytemnestra -RRB- . 
To the contrary , Bush stayed home and sent others to do his battles with the enemy . 
Froomkin did not exhibit jealousy of Bush 's cavorting with a lover , a jealousy that resulted in Clytemnestra killing both Agamemnon and his concubine . 
Froomkin exhibits no hatred or a lovers jealousy , he starts with facts and demonstrates linkages , then draws conclusions . 
His writing is dispassionate and devoid of emotion , unlike Clytemnestra . 
Head back to class and improve your critical writing skills . 
Yet it 's painfully obvious that capitalism alone can not pull us out of this massive financial mess without crushing and perhaps revolutionary problems lasting a generation . 
I 'll say it again , anyone who thinks otherwise ca n't do math . 
There literally is n't enough global liquidity and appetite for risk to place bets . 
- The Bush years raise the question of what is the Republican 's definition of government . 
The last 8 years demonstrate the lack of government for the common good . 
Reasonable regulation is a good thing , even for us inventors and capitalists . 
The SEC was euthanized in January 2001 . 
The FTC , FCC , FDA , EPA , FEMA soon followed . 
The FAA survived , but has been contracted out to Lockheed -LRB- a terrible , act -RRB- . 
I compare good regulation to gravity . 
I do n't like them , but I can engineer around them , or use them to my advantage in novel ways - hey , I 'm an inventor ! 
Regulations are important for leveling the playing field . 
As an inventor , the patent office protects me as much as IBM -LRB- well , they used to before Bush gutted them and gave priority to big company ideas -RRB- . 
A major problem with government during the last 8 years was that even my startups were advised to hire DC lobbyists to game the system for a price . 
Here in Silicon Valley , that 's anathema to our culture . 
But within 15 minutes of my first call to a friend , we were given the name of Jack Abramoff 's firm , Greenberg Traurig , and told if we could pay mid 6 figures we too could score a $ 49 million contract . 
I can look into my call logs in October 2001 and give you the time of the call . 
Suffice to say , such behavior made me sick and we never did so . 
We 've also turned down `` introductions '' through uniformed military revolving door types with multiple stars . 
Again , behavior that Harry Truman would have pilloried as war profiteering . 
I 'm still not sanguine about new format , but I can appreciate your desire to get stories out while news . 
Being on the west coast , everything I see is old anyway . 
However there is something he has yet to learn . 
Occasionally , whether reading from a teleprompter or notes , he needs to look at the camera . 
This is where his audience is , and how you get a point across . 
He also needs to change either his speech writers or advisers . 
Every time he talks , the stock market drops . 
I think there is a message there . 
With the Republicans , again it 's about power and not the people who , coincidentally , made it possible for them to have their job . 
I listened to Jindle 's -LRB- sp ? -RRB- 
speech and laughed so hard I could barely contain myself . 
He spoke to the American people as if we were a bunch of five year olds . 
If this is the best the Republicans can do , they need to go back to the drawing board . 
As for me , I am ashamed to admit that Eric Cantor is from Va. . 
What a waste of space this man is . 
He ca n't see the current problems of the country for the star that he is trying so hard to reach for . 
The Republicans just ca n't seem to get it through their heads that the current problems will not be solved with their reaching for power . 
This country needs help and it seems to me that the Republicans would want to help since it was them that managed to get us where we are today . 
So glad you agree . 
So glad you agree . 
And Bush still sucks . 
Do n't upper income folks pay the vast majority of income taxes in the country ? 
Do n't the poorest workers pay none , but instead receive the Earned Income Tax Credit ? 
Are n't those the facts of the existing Pre-Obama income tax structure ?

"Still the best political coverage . 
In Speech to Congress , Obama Outlines His Plans for Economic Recovery President Obama offered a grim portrait of America 's plight in an address to a joint session of Congress last night , but he promised to lead an economic renewal that would lift the country out of its current crisis without bankrupting its future . 
Striking an optimistic tone that has been absent from his speeches in recent weeks , the president said his stimulus plan , bank bailout proposal , housing programs and health-care overhaul would work in concert to turn around the nation 's struggling economy . 
And while he bluntly described a country beset by historic economic challenges and continued threats abroad , he said the solution lies in directly confronting -- not ignoring -- those problems . 
`` The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation , '' he said . 
`` The answers to our problems do n't lie beyond our reach . 
They exist in our laboratories and universities , in our fields and our factories , in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on Earth . '' 
In an address that largely shunned foreign policy to focus on the economy , Obama added : `` Now is the time to jump-start job creation , restart lending , and invest in areas like energy , health care and education that will grow our economy , even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down . '' 
The 52-minute speech was greeted with sustained applause in the House chamber , which he had helped populate with more members of his party . 
Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike rose repeatedly to offer their approval of the president 's rhetoric and his promise of recovery . 
Obama received a standing ovation when he vowed that corporate chief executives would no longer travel on private jets at the same time they laid off thousands of workers . 
`` Those days are over , '' he said . 
Lawmakers leapt to their feet again when he declared that `` health-care reform can not wait , it must not wait , and it will not wait another year . '' 
While he largely avoided partisan rhetoric and did not directly point the finger of blame at his predecessor , George W. Bush , Obama did describe an `` era '' of greed and short-term profit that he said the nation is now leaving behind , and he stressed that he had not created but rather `` inherited '' the $ 1 trillion deficit , along with what he called `` a financial crisis and a costly recession . '' 
The `` day of reckoning has arrived , '' he declared , warning members of both parties in Congress that they will be forced to sacrifice `` worthy priorities '' as the crisis continues . 
But he made it clear that he is not prepared to retreat from his own ambitious agenda . 
The president called on Congress to pass a market-based cap on carbon pollution . 
He vowed a renewed effort to provide health care to all Americans . 
And he called on Americans to attend at least one year of college or vocational training , pledging that by 2020 , the country will again lead the world in the proportion of college graduates . 
Obama did seek to temper expectations in his address , acknowledging that he can not `` solve every problem or address every issue . '' 
But he promised to deliver a budget tomorrow that will serve as a new `` vision for America -- as a blueprint for our future . '' 
He avoided in-depth discussion of his Iraq policy , saying only that in the coming days he will `` announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war . '' 
That announcement could come as early as Friday , during a trip to North Carolina . 
Advisers said he is considering a plan to withdraw all U.S. combat troops from Iraq as soon as August 2010 , three months later than promised during the campaign . 
After weeks of persistent questions about whether he had grown too downcast and pessimistic in describing the economic crisis to the American people , White House officials said Obama was seeking to strike an appropriate balance between hope -- the mantra of his campaign -- and realism in an era of serious problems . 
He sought to juxtapose those ideas repeatedly , saying at one point : `` While our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken , though we are living through difficult and uncertain times , tonight I want every American to know this : We will rebuild , we will recover , and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before . '' 
"
"FACING AN economic crisis , a banking crisis , a housing crisis and an auto industry crisis , President Obama used the opportunity of his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night to load his plate with even more . 
Mr. Obama said he would press ahead with plans to overhaul the nation 's health-care system , bolster education and lead the transition to new forms of energy -- all while curing cancer and getting the deficit under control . 
We understand the president 's instinct not to let short-term demands obscure the need to meet the country 's long-term challenges . 
His priorities for fundamental reform , the causes that animated his campaign , are admirable ones . 
Yet we can not help wondering : Is n't the most critical task to ensure a swift and effective response to the stomach-churning downturn ? 
Does a new , understaffed administration have the capacity to try so much so fast ? 
And does the political system have the bandwidth to accommodate all that Mr. Obama is asking from it ? 
`` The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we 're taking to revive our economy in the short-term , '' Mr. Obama said . 
`` But the only way to fully restore America 's economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs , new industries and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world . 
The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care ; the schools that are n't preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit . '' 
Mr. Obama said the budget he will submit tomorrow will reflect `` the stark reality of what we 've inherited -- a trillion-dollar deficit , a financial crisis and a costly recession , '' and that `` worthy priorities '' will have to be sacrificed . 
But his message was more about what could be done than what would have to be left out . 
Mr. Obama said his administration has `` already identified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade , '' but about half of that involves his long-promised rollback of tax cuts from the previous administration . 
In this economic emergency , the most important goal for Mr. Obama is one he laid out near the beginning of his speech : `` We will rebuild , we will recover , and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before . '' 
As he acknowledged last night , to enable that recovery the administration may well need to go back to Congress to seek more money for ailing banks . 
Given the public mood and lawmakers who feel burned by the handling of the first $ 350 billion infusion , that will be a hard enough lift in and of itself . 
As Mr. Obama also noted , the American public is understandably skeptical about whether the money Washington has already committed to spend will be wasted . 
Even the political capital of the popular Mr. Obama is not unlimited . 
We hope he does not spread it so broadly that he is left without the means to extinguish the fires raging now . 
Do you have a different take on Obama 's address and his agenda ?

"The daily White House intelligence report that catalogs the top security threats to the nation has a grim new addition , reflecting the realities of the age : a daily update on the global financial crisis and its cascading effects on the stability of countries through the world . 
The first Economic Intelligence Briefing report was presented to the White House yesterday by the CIA , the agency 's new director , Leon Panetta , revealed at a news conference . 
The addition of economic news to the daily roundup of terrorist attacks and surveillance reports appears to reflect a growing belief among intelligence officials that the economic meltdown is now preeminent among security threats facing the United States . 
`` We 've seen the impact of a worldwide recession occur throughout the world , '' said Panetta , who described the agency 's newest product at his first news briefing since his confirmation . 
Instigated at the request of the White House , the daily report will ensure that U.S. policymakers are `` not surprised '' by the aftershocks from bank failures and rising unemployment , he said . 
The spy agency is following worrisome trends in many corners of the globe , from East Asia to Latin America . 
In private meetings yesterday , Latin American intelligence officials warned their U.S. counterparts of a crisis spreading throughout the hemisphere , particularly in Argentina , Ecuador and Venezuela , Panetta said . 
`` Clearly , it 's related : What happens in the economy , and what 's happening as a result of that , is affecting the stability of the world , '' he said . 
Other key intelligence officials have raised similar alarms in other settings . 
The new director of national intelligence , Dennis C. Blair , told a Senate panel this month that economic woes have largely replaced terrorism as the country 's No. 1 security challenge . 
Blair repeated the theme yesterday in testimony before the House intelligence committee , noting that three European governments have fallen because of economic issues . 
Central and Eastern Europe `` are under tremendous strain , '' and much of Eurasia , Latin American and sub-Saharan Africa lack sufficient cash reserves and access to international aid , he said . 
`` Our analysis indicates that economic crisis increases the risk of regime-threatening instability if it continues for a one - or two-year period , '' Blair said . 
`` Instability can loosen the fragile hold that many developing countries have on law and order . '' 
The economic crunch adds to a formidable list of global concerns facing the new administration 's security team . 
Panetta said the CIA continues to regard al-Qaeda as a serious threat , as the terrorist movement retains its stronghold along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and gains momentum in Somalia and Yemen .

"The World Bank and two European development banks are expected to announce today in London that they will provide $ 31 billion over two years to shore up ailing banks and businesses in Eastern and Central Europe , attempting to forestall a financial meltdown that also threatens the stability of banks in Western Europe . 
The World Bank is partnering with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank to provide equity and debt financing , credit lines and political risk insurance to Eastern and Central European banks and businesses . 
The EIB is the lending arm of the European Union . 
The London-based EBRD was created in 1991 to support private sector development in Central and Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union and now includes nations such as Egypt and South Korea . 
The announcement follows recent warnings by World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick that the economic and political gains Eastern and Central Europe have made in post-communist decades could be destroyed if their richer neighbors to the West do n't do more to help them . 
`` This is a time for Europe to come together to ensure that the achievements of the last 20 years are not lost because of an economic crisis that is rapidly turning into a human crisis , '' Zoellick said in a written statement . 
German officials appear to have overcome their initial reluctance to send bailout money to Eastern Europe and said earlier this week they would be willing to work through the IMF to send more aid . 
Germany 's change of heart is part of a growing acknowledgment among leaders in Western Europe that a financial crisis in the region could spill over into their own countries . 
Because of the global slowdown , many countries in Eastern and Central Europe are suffering a painful economic reversal after years of robust growth . 
Demand for exports has fallen precipitously . 
Foreign banks , many of them based in nations such as Austria and Sweden , invested heavily in the region and have been forced to pull back in part because of bad loans made at home . 
Exchange rates in Central and Eastern Europe have also tumbled , exacerbating the debt burden of governments and home owners alike . 
If they default , Western European banks would likely feel the pain in short order . 
The International Monetary Fund has helped forestall a financial meltdown by providing tens of billions in loans to Latvia , Serbia , Belarus , Ukraine , and Hungary . 
But analysts and European policymakers think they will need more . 
Under the two-year plan to be unveiled today , the EBRD will provide about $ 7.6 billion for the financial sector in the form of equity and debt financing to banks and directly to small and medium-sized businesses . 
The EIB will provide about $ 14 billion in lending to businesses . 
The World Bank Group will provide about $ 9.5 billion of lending , equity financing and political risk insurance . 
Although the amount pledged by the World Bank , the EBRD and the EIB is probably not enough to end the crisis , `` it 's a good start , '' said Morris Goldstein , a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics . 
`` You 're going to need money from a lot of sources to deal with the Eastern European banking problem . ''

"Royal Bank of Scotland Posts Largest Annual Corporate Loss in British History A sign of Royal Bank of Scotland -LRB- RBS -RRB- at a branch in central London , in this Tuesday , Feb. 10 , 2009 file photo . 
The Royal Bank of Scotland has posted the largest annual loss in British corporate history of 24.14 billion pounds -LRB- $ 34.4 billion -RRB- for 2008 . 
The bank also confirmed in Thursday Feb. 26 , 2009 earnings report that it will offload toxic assets into a government insurance program . 
-LRB- AP Photo\/Sang Tan -RRB- -LRB- Sang Tan - AP -RRB- LONDON , Feb. 26 -- The Royal Bank of Scotland , a global giant whose spectacular crash has become a symbol of banking excesses of the past decade , reported the largest annual corporate loss in the history of the United Kingdom on Thursday . 
The bank , which is now 70 percent owned by British taxpayers following an unprecedented government bailout , reported that its 2008 losses were 24.1 billion pounds , or about $ 34.5 billion at current exchange rates . 
The RBS losses are the latest in a string of increasingly grim financial results in Britain , where -- as in the United States -- the global financial crisis has caused thousands of job losses and business closings and record numbers of home repossessions . 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown will discuss the global response to the financial crisis next week when he meets with President Obama at the White House and addresses a joint session of the U.S. Congress . 
The bank , in a statement , said it would seek government insurance for $ 465 billion in toxic assets through a new program designed to shore up teetering banks . 
Under that scheme , which is similar to a `` bad bank '' scenario in which financial institutions are able to separate performing assets from nonperforming ones , the bank would be responsible for the first $ 27.9 billion in losses on those assets . 
After that , taxpayers would be responsible for 90 percent of any new losses , the bank said . 
Lloyds Banking Group , which includes the merged Lloyds TSB and HBOS , is also widely reported to be planning to sign up for the scheme Friday , when it will report 2008 results that are also expected to show remarkable losses . 
`` We owe our continued independence to the U.K. government and taxpayers and are very thankful for their support , '' said RBS Chairman Philip Hampton , whose bank has been partly nationalized with an injection of $ 28.6 billion in government funds . 
The bank said Thursday that the government would inject an additional $ 18.6 billion in capital . 
The bank also has an option to seek $ 8.5 billion more . 
While the fall of RBS is a complex story combining both corporate hubris and the stunning misjudgments of the subprime mortgage crisis , former chief executive Fred Goodwin has emerged as the prime symbol of the bank 's failures . 
Goodwin 's hard-charging expansion of what began as a modest Scottish bank -- particularly the disastrous 2007 takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro -- is widely seen in Britain as a key reason RBS collapsed under the weight of massive bad debt . 
So anger , both among the public and in the halls of Parliament , grew Thursday when it was disclosed that Goodwin , 50 , was awarded a lifetime annual pension of $ 931,000 .

"THERE ARE many metrics for judging a president 's budget proposal . 
Is it honest in accounting for known costs over a reasonable time frame ? 
Would its approach put the country on a sustainable fiscal course ? 
Are its tax and spending provisions good policy -- and politically plausible ? 
In this dire economic climate , there 's another important question : Is the administration concentrating enough on the task at hand , which is helping to right the economy , or does it overreach in envisioning new taxes and programs ? 
On the honesty scale , President Obama 's budget offers some improvements . 
It acknowledges some huge expenses that Bush administration budgets studiously ignored , such as the cost of providing relief from the alternative minimum tax . 
It provides $ 130 billion in war funding for 2010 , a reasonable estimate . 
It provides for the contingency that the administration will seek another $ 750 billion -LRB- reflected as $ 250 billion on the budget books on the theory that some of the spending will be recouped -RRB- in emergency funding for financial stabilization . 
But the assumption that war spending will drop to $ 50 billion per year after 2010 is wildly at odds with Mr. Obama 's stated commitment to success in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
His self-congratulatory claim of having identified $ 2 trillion in `` savings '' relies almost entirely on the presumed lower war costs and a long-promised rollback of the Bush administration 's high-end tax cuts . 
Yesterday 's budget shows a gargantuan deficit of $ 1.75 trillion , 12.3 percent of gross domestic product , in this fiscal year . 
The budget projects deficits declining to around 3 percent of GDP from 2013 through 2019 , but they may be far higher if Mr. Obama 's projections of economic growth prove optimistic . 
Long-term fiscal stability will require more than getting rising health-care costs under control , as important as that is . 
Mr. Obama 's statement Tuesday that the country should `` begin a conversation '' about Social Security was disappointingly anemic . 
The conversation has been going on for a long time . 
It is action that has been , and remains , missing . 
Mr. Obama proposes a `` down payment '' of $ 634 billion over 10 years on expanding health insurance , about half of what he says is required . 
His outline leaves open for discussion with Congress big questions about the shape of the plan and the source of additional funding . 
His proposals to reduce Medicare costs by instituting competitive bidding among private Medicare Advantage programs , cutting payments for home health care and prescription drugs , and raising premiums for higher-income beneficiaries are certain to produce the usual howls . 
The same is true of Mr. Obama 's suggestion to pay for part of his health program by reducing the value of mortgage , charitable and other deductions for the highest-income taxpayers . 
Under the current fiscal circumstances , it is critical that Mr. Obama and Congress hew to the principle , set out in this budget , that health-care reform not add to the deficit . 
Mr. Obama proposes to pay for the additional tax credits he promised to lavish on 95 percent of Americans with revenue generated by a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions -- a kind of indirect tax on oil , gas and coal . 
Since this will raise expenses for all Americans , marrying these two initiatives makes sense , philosophically and fiscally . 
Once again , however , the trick will be resisting the inevitable political demands to use the revenue to cushion the blow for polluting industries . 
Mr. Obama has reached for a lot in this budget ; he needs to make certain that he remains focused on the economic crisis and to adjust his ambitious aims if the recovery does not proceed as he hopes . 
"
"Tuesday , March 3 , 2009 ; 4:57 PM President Obama , seeking to boost public confidence in his economic recovery plan and U.S. markets , suggested today that now is a good time for investors with `` a long-term perspective '' to buy stocks , and he vowed that the nation 's financial mess `` is going to get cleaned up . '' 
Speaking to reporters after an Oval Office meeting with visiting British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Obama said he has no doubt that his plan to rescue the U.S. economy will work . 
Among the topics he discussed with Brown , he said , were efforts to coordinate economic stimulus plans with other members of the Group of 20 , an organization of major world economies that is holding a summit meeting in London next month . 
On the domestic front , `` I 'm absolutely confident that credit 's going to be flowing again , that businesses are going to start seeing opportunities for investment , they 're going to start hiring again , people are going to be put back to work , '' Obama said in response to a question . 
`` What I 'm looking at is not the day-to-day gyrations of the stock market , but the long-term ability for the United States and the entire world economy to regain its footing . 
And , you know , the stock market is sort of like a tracking poll in politics . 
You know , it bobs up and down day to day . 
And if you spend all your time worrying about that , then you 're probably going to get the long-term strategy wrong . '' 
The U.S. banking system `` has been dealt a heavy blow , '' and a lot of losses `` are working their way through the system , '' Obama said , adding that `` it 's not surprising that the market is hurting as a consequence . '' 
He continued , `` On the other hand , what you 're now seeing is profit and earning ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you 've got a long-term perspective on it . 
I think that consumer confidence , as they see the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act taking root -- businesses are starting to see opportunities for investment and potential hiring . 
We are going to start creating jobs again . '' 
Obama predicted that government actions `` are going to slowly build confidence , but it 's not going to happen overnight . '' 
He urged Americans `` to just recognize that we dug a very deep hole for ourselves . 
There were a lot of bad decisions that were made . 
We are cleaning up that mess . 
It 's going to be sort of full of fits and starts , in terms of getting the mess cleaned up ; but it 's going to get cleaned up . '' 
`` And we are going to recover , '' Obama said . 
`` And we are going to emerge more prosperous , more unified and , I think , more protected from systemic risk , having learned these lessons , than we were before . '' 
Pressed later at a White House news briefing on whether Obama had essentially issued a `` buy call '' to help boost the stock market , spokesman Robert Gibbs dismissed the notion . 
Obama has often `` talked about the fact that brighter days for our economy are ahead , if we take important steps and make important decisions now , about addressing many of the problems and challenges that we face . '' 
He said Obama has also said `` that it 's not his job to comment on or react to what the market does , up and down , on any given day , but instead to look at the longer term , at the longer horizon , at what can be done in this country to meet those challenges . '' 
On Capitol Hill , meanwhile , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the government needs to continue moving aggressively to combat the recession and financial crisis , even as it takes steps to rein in the budget deficit in the longer term . 
Testifying before the Senate Budget Committee , Bernanke said more money might be needed to stabilize the financial system . 
`` Although progress has been made on the financial front since last fall , more needs to be done , '' Bernanke said . 
`` Whether further funds will be needed depends on the results of the current supervisory assessment of banks , the evolution of the economy and other factors . 
The administration has included a placeholder in its budget for more funding for financial stabilization , should it be necessary . '' 
With that and fiscal stimulus spending , the government debt will likely approach 60 percent of gross domestic product , up from 40 percent before the financial crisis and the highest since the years after World War II . 
Bernanke said that debt ratio makes it all the more important to contain deficits in the future to maintain credibility among the investors worldwide who buy U.S. government debt . 
But he gave a strong endorsement to continued -- and expensive -- efforts to deal with the crisis in the near term . 
`` We are better off moving aggressively today to solve our economic problems , '' Bernanke said . 
`` The alternative could be a prolonged episode of economic stagnation that would not only contribute to further deterioration in the fiscal situation , but would also imply lower output , employment and incomes for an extended period . '' 
But , he added , `` maintaining the confidence of the financial markets requires that we begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance . '' 
He said the government will need to withdraw the temporary parts of the fiscal stimulus as the economy recovers , and spending on stabilizing the financial system must `` wind down . '' 
Bernanke , as is his practice , neither endorsed nor opposed many specific spending recommendations contained in the proposed budget released by the Obama administration last week . 
On such issues as energy , health care , education and tax policy , he said only that they are `` complex policy issues in which the specific design of each program is as important as the budgetary amount allocated to it '' and that Congress `` will have considerable work in evaluating how to proceed . ''

"Forget the 8,570 earmarks in a bill supported by a president who poses as the scourge of earmarks . 
Forget the `` 2 trillion dollars in savings '' that `` we have already identified , '' $ 1.6 trillion of which President Obama 's budget director later admits is the `` savings '' of not continuing the surge in Iraq until 2019 -- 11 years after George Bush ended it , and eight years after even Bush would have had us out of Iraq completely . 
The logic of Obama 's address to Congress went like this : `` Our economy did not fall into decline overnight , '' he averred . 
Indeed , it all began before the housing crisis . 
What did we do wrong ? 
We are paying for past sins in three principal areas : energy , health care and education -- importing too much oil and not finding new sources of energy -LRB- as in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer Continental Shelf ? -RRB- 
, not reforming health care , and tolerating too many bad schools . 
The `` day of reckoning '' has arrived . 
And because `` it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we 'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament , '' Obama has come to redeem us with his far-seeing program of universal , heavily nationalized health care ; a cap-and-trade tax on energy ; and a major federalization of education with universal access to college as the goal . 
As an explanation of our current economic difficulties , this is total fantasy . 
As a cure for rapidly growing joblessness , a massive destruction of wealth , a deepening worldwide recession , this is perhaps the greatest non sequitur ever foisted upon the American people . 
At the very center of our economic near-depression is a credit bubble , a housing collapse and a systemic failure of the banking industry . 
One can come up with a host of causes : Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pushed by Washington -LRB- and greed -RRB- into improvident loans , corrupted bond-ratings agencies , insufficient regulation of new and exotic debt instruments , the easy money policy of Alan Greenspan 's Fed , irresponsible bankers pushing -LRB- and then unloading in packaged loan instruments -RRB- highly dubious mortgages , greedy house-flippers , deceitful home buyers . 
The list is long . 
But the list of causes of the collapse of the financial system does not include the absence of universal health care , let alone of computerized medical records . 
Nor the absence of an industry-killing cap-and-trade carbon levy . 
Nor the lack of college graduates . 
Indeed , one could perversely make the case that , if anything , the proliferation of overeducated , Gucci-wearing , smart-ass MBAs inventing ever more sophisticated and opaque mathematical models and debt instruments helped get us into this credit catastrophe . 
And yet with our financial house on fire , Obama makes clear both in his speech and his budget that the essence of his presidency will be the transformation of health care , education and energy . 
Four months after winning the election , six weeks after his swearing-in , Obama has yet to unveil a plan to deal with the banking crisis . 
What 's going on ? 
`` You never want a serious crisis to go to waste , '' said chief of staff Rahm Emanuel . 
`` This crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before . '' 
Now we know what they are . 
The markets ' recent precipitous decline is a reaction not just to the absence of any plausible bank rescue plan , but also to the suspicion that Obama sees the continuing financial crisis as usefully creating the psychological conditions -- the sense of crisis bordering on fear-itself panic -- for enacting his `` Big Bang '' agenda to federalize and\/or socialize health care , education and energy , the commanding heights of post-industrial society . 
Clever politics , but intellectually dishonest to the core . 
Health , education and energy -- worthy and weighty as they may be -- are not the cause of our financial collapse . 
And they are not the cure . 
The fraudulent claim that they are both cause and cure is the rhetorical device by which an ambitious president intends to enact the most radical agenda of social transformation seen in our lifetime .

"Are Women Really Risk Averse ? 
The conventional wisdom is that women are more risk averse than men and so might have been less likely to promote and support the kind of risk-taking culture that seems to have led to the current financial crisis . 
However , research conducted at the Center for Gender in Organizations at the Simmons College School of Management in Boston suggests that this conclusion needs to be seen in a more nuanced way . 
By the standard means of testing , women do seem to be more risk averse when making risk\/reward trade-offs . 
But when risk is understood more broadly , women seem as likely as men to take risks like launching new products or starting new projects . 
Certainly , some of the bankers who oversaw the development of the now-demonized financial products were women -- like Zoe Cruz at Morgan Stanley , for example -- although they are obviously not as well represented in those ranks as their male colleagues -LRB- holding less than 40 percent of the jobs on Wall Street -RRB- . 
So from that perspective , we might not have seen any differences . 
However , a further finding of the study is that women tend to take the broader context into account in making decisions that entail risk to them and their organizations and are more attuned to see changes in support for such actions . 
So it is possible that having women in leadership roles might have lessened the severity of the crisis , because women might have begun to appreciate its consequences sooner and as regulators they might have taken action more swiftly .

aha , I recently re-read `` Economics in One Lesson '' by Henry Hazlitt -- a New York Times economics editor . 
He writes about good economists , who promote policies designed to benefit the whole of society vs. special interest groups . 
And good economists consider long-term policy outcomes along with short-term goals . 
Both of these principals have been forgotten by recent misbehavior amony Wall Street , banks , and congress . 
Hazlitt 's observations track with the conclusions of the study cited in this article . 
In The Triple Bind , psychologist Stephen Hinshaw and Rachael Kranz observe society 's messages for adolescent girls . 
In many ways , today is the best time in history to be a girl : Opportunities for a girl s success are as unlimited as her dreams . 
Yet an alarm is sounding , revealing a disturbing portrait of the stresses affecting girls of all ages . 
Societal expectations , cultural trends , and conflicting messages are creating what psychologist and researcher Stephen Hinshaw calls the Triple Bind . 
Girls are now expected to excel at girl skills , achieve boy goals , and be models of female perfection , 100 percent of the time . 
The Triple Bind is putting more and more girls at risk for aggression , eating disorders , depression , and even suicide . 
We see these same risks at work in Wall Street .

"U.S. Downturn Dragging World Into Recession Report Says Global Economy Will Shrink for First Time Since 1940s Job candidates tussle for enrollment forms at a career fair in India , where more than half a million jobs vanished in the last three months of 2008 , according to the World Bank . 
-LRB- By Mahesh Kumar -- Associated Press -RRB- Your browser 's settings may be preventing you from commenting on and viewing comments about this item . 
See instructions for fixing the problem . 
Monday , March 9 , 2009 ; Page A01 The world is falling into the first global recession since World War II as the crisis that started in the United States engulfs once-booming developing nations , confronting them with massive financial shortfalls that could turn back the clock on poverty reduction by years , the World Bank warned yesterday . 
The World Bank also cautioned that the cost of helping poorer nations in crisis would exceed the current financial resources of multilateral lenders . 
Such aid could prove critical to political stability as concerns mount over unrest in poorer nations , particularly in Eastern Europe , generated by their sharp reversal of fortunes as private investment evaporates and global trade collapses . 
In its report , released ahead of a major summit of finance ministers in London this week , the World Bank called on developed nations struggling with their own economic routs to dedicate 0.7 percent of the money they spend on stimulus programs toward a new Vulnerability Fund to help developing countries . 
The report predicted that the global economy will shrink this year for the first time since the 1940s , reducing earlier estimates that emerging markets would propel the world to positive growth even as the United States , Europe and Japan tanked . 
The dire prediction underscored what many are calling a mounting crisis within a crisis , as the downturn that started in the wealthy nations of the West washes over developing countries through a pullback in investment , trade and credit . 
Despite the United States ' position as the epicenter of the crisis , investors are flocking to U.S. Treasury bills and the dollar , squeezing developing nations out of global credit markets . 
`` We need to react in real time to a growing crisis that is hurting people in developing countries , '' World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick said in a statement . 
Action is needed by governments and multilateral lenders `` to avoid social and political unrest , '' he said . 
The report said that 94 out of 116 developing countries have been hit by economic slowdowns . 
The World Bank projected that the economic crisis will push around 46 million people into poverty in 2009 through job and wage cuts , as well as declining flows of remittances , the money that foreign workers send to their families . 
Net private capital flows to emerging markets are plunging , set to fall to $ 165 billion this year -- or 17 percent of their 2007 levels . 
Falling demand in the West is sparking the sharpest drop in world trade in 80 years , sending sales of the products and commodities of poorer nations spiraling down , the report said . 
That decline is touching off a wave of job losses . 
Cambodia has lost 30,000 jobs in the garment industry . 
In India , more than half a million jobs vanished in the last three months of 2008 , including cuts in the gem , jewelry , auto and textile industries , according to the World Bank . 
As a result , the report estimates that at least 98 countries may have problems financing at least $ 268 billion in public and private debt this year . 
It noted a worsening in market conditions could raise that figure as high as $ 700 billion . 
Additionally , only one quarter of vulnerable developing countries , the World Bank said , have the ability to launch their own stimulus programs or to independently finance measures such as job-creation or safety-net programs . 
To help them , multilateral lenders will need to dig deep . 
The World Bank remains well financed and is positioned to almost triple spending to $ 35 billion this year . 
But it warned the scope of the need in the developing world will exceed the combined ability of major multilateral lenders , and it called on governments in major nations and the private sector to pitch in more . 
For instance , its sister organization , the International Monetary Fund , recently received $ 100 billion more from Japan but is still asking more affluent nations to come up with an additional $ 150 billion to replenish its rapidly diminishing funds . 
While the World Bank aims to reduce global poverty largely through long-term projects in the developing world , the IMF is charged with offering bigger , more immediate bailouts to countries on the verge of economic collapse . 
The list of countries fitting that description has soared in recent months . 
In November alone , the IMF parceled out $ 50 billion to nations in crisis -- the most the institution has ever spent in a single month . 
With more nations , particularly in Eastern Europe and Central Asia , facing serious trouble , the IMF is preparing to hand out tens of billions more . 
It is hoping to raise more funds from Western nations and other cash-rich countries such as China and those in the Middle East . 
The concern now , however , is that the scope of the crisis may be so vast that even an extra $ 150 billion may not enough . 
Some fear that nations in Western Europe such as Austria , Ireland and Spain -- believed to have graduated from IMF lifelines decades ago -- may soon require bailouts , taking funds that would have been spent on poorer nations . 
It could also prove difficult to raise more money from hard-hit countries including the United States and Britain , where politicians and citizens may decide that charity begins at home . 
`` I 'm worried about what happens when you see that a Greece or an Ireland that might need bailouts , '' said Simon Johnson , an MIT economics professor and former IMF chief economist .

"State regulators trying to help life insurance companies cope with the financial crisis have granted $ 6 billion of relief from requirements meant to ensure financial stability , according to data released yesterday . 
The top recipients were Allstate Life Insurance Co. with $ 1.4 billion ; Jackson National Life Insurance Co. with $ 825.6 million and Hartford Life Insurance Co. with $ 655.2 million , according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners . 
The relief typically came in the form of accounting changes that allowed companies to pad their financial cushions , in effect making them appear stronger than they otherwise would . 
Insurance companies are required to maintain such cushions , known as capital and surplus , to absorb losses and pay claims . 
Much of the padding involves increased counting of potential tax benefits that could end up being worthless to the companies . 
For the top three recipients , the regulatory relief accounted for 42.6 percent , 22 percent and 16.1 percent , respectively , of their financial cushions as of Dec. 31 , 2008 , according to an analysis of the NAIC data . 
Like other investors and financial institutions , life insurance companies have seen the value of their investments reduced by the financial crisis . 
Unlike banks , though , insurers have yet to receive federal bailouts to replenish lost capital . 
Industry leaders have argued that regulatory relief could help insurers weather the crisis . 
They have expressed hope that it will stave off downgrades to their credit ratings , which can be damaging to their business . 
They also want to avoid having to raise capital from investors , which could cost a lot of money and dilute the value of shareholders ' stock . 
Critics such as the Consumer Federation of America have argued that the relief could weaken insurance companies and leave policyholders at greater risk . 
The American Council of Life Insurers , an industry group , sought blanket relief earlier this year from the NAIC , an umbrella group for state regulators . 
When the NAIC refused , many state regulators filled the breach , granting special dispensations to individual companies headquartered in their states . 
Some state regulators said they wanted to make sure their home-state companies were n't left at a competitive disadvantage . 
The result is an accounting hodgepodge that makes it harder to compare insurers and gives some companies an edge over others . 
When insurers ' finances deteriorate below certain levels , state regulators can take a number of steps , such as requiring companies to submit a recovery plan or taking them over altogether . 
With few exceptions , the relief granted by regulators did not allow companies to escape increased supervision , the NAIC data suggest .

"U.S. to Toughen Its Stance On Trade The Obama administration is aggressively reworking U.S. trade policy to more strongly emphasize domestic and social issues , from the displacement of American workers to climate change . 
Even as world trade takes its steepest drop in 80 years amid the global economic crisis , the administration is preparing to take a harder line with America 's trading partners . 
It will seek new benchmarks before supporting already-written trade agreements with Colombia and South Korea and is suggesting that it will dig in its heels on global trade talks , demanding that other countries make broader concessions first . 
`` I believe in trade and will work to expand it , but I also know that not all Americans are winning from it and that our trading partners are not always playing by the rules , '' Ron Kirk , President Obama 's nominee as U.S. trade representative , said in confirmation hearing testimony last night before the Senate Finance Committee . 
The shift underscores the mounting pressures confronting any effort to expand trade during the economic crisis . 
Even before the global economy went code red late last year , talks aimed at expanding global trade stalled as Western countries warred with emerging giants like China and India over how to further open markets . 
Those divides appear to be more unbreachable than ever as world leaders move to protect their domestic industries from the ravages of the financial crisis , embracing new trade barriers aimed at imported goods and other measures meant to restrict the flow of capital outside their borders . 
In the United States , more Americans are blaming cheap imports for job losses at home and congressional leaders pressed successfully to include a `` buy American '' provision in the $ 787 billion stimulus program to give an edge to U.S.-made products . 
`` Our consensus to advance international trade is frayed , '' Sen. Max Baucus -LRB- D-Mont . -RRB- 
said at Kirk 's hearing yesterday . 
`` Our faith in the international trading system is badly shaken . '' 
During the campaign , Obama said he generally supports free-trade policies but also signaled a tougher approach that is only now beginning to be outlined . 
Both in Kirk 's testimony yesterday and in a policy statement issued by new Obama appointees at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative , the administration vowed to make tougher labor and environmental standards prerequisites for trade deals . 
Rather than stressing the signing of new agreements , the administration indicated that it will instead prioritize stricter enforcement of existing ones before the World Trade Organization -- the Geneva-based body that arbitrates global trade . 
In what appeared to be a jab at the Bush administration 's zealous pursuit of free-trade agreements , Kirk , a former mayor of Dallas , said : `` I do not come to this job ... with deal fever . 
We 're not going to do deals just for doing so . '' 
The administration , he said , is conducting a review of trade agreements signed by the previous administration with South Korea , Colombia and Panama . 
He said outright that the deal with South Korea , as currently written , `` is simply unfair . '' 
He added that `` we are prepared to step away from that '' if it is not reworked . 
The new administration policy statement , released by the trade representative 's office last week , said Obama would seek new benchmarks for the passage of the agreements with South Korea and Colombia . 
South Korea has come under fire for its hurdles for U.S. automakers , while U.S. unions have said Colombia has not done enough to combat violence against labor leaders there . 
Though Kirk declined to detail what those benchmarks may be , analysts have suggested that they might involve , for instance , a U.S. insistence that murders of union leaders be sharply reduced in Colombia before lending support to the deal . 
The trade representative 's office also stated that trade policy must now contain a new element of `` social accountability , '' including on issues such as climate change . 
`` We should aim to make trade a part of the tool kit of solutions for addressing international environmental challenges , '' the statement said . 
`` The result will be a complete rethink on what U.S. priorities are on trade and what trade agreements look like in the future , '' said Randall Soderquist , senior trade program associate at the Center for Global Development . 
`` This could mean starting from scratch versus just taking the baton from the Bush administration . '' 
Yet the administration still appears to be toeing a line , saying it will move to address the concerns of American workers while also carefully avoiding words and deeds that directly smack of protectionism . 
Though Obama said before the elections that he would seek to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement , he has since backed away from that statement , vowing during his recent trip to Canada to avoid protectionism . 
Obama 's opposition to a stronger version of the `` buy American '' provisions added to the stimulus bill last month by congressional Democrats is also viewed as a major reason it was eventually watered down before the bill reached his desk for signing . 
In addition , Kirk -- who appears headed for confirmation despite an admission that he mistakenly underpaid his taxes by $ 10,000 -- is viewed by many as a pragmatist who in the past has supported the notion of free trade . 
Yet the administration , analysts say , is also up against an American public that is increasingly blaming the open U.S. trade policies of the past as part of the toxic mix at the root of the nation 's economic problems . 
Kirk suggested as much yesterday . 
`` It is true that cheaper foreign products helped squeezed American families stretch their dollars , and the sale of our goods and services abroad support American families , '' he said . 
`` But it is also true that the overarching benefits of trade are difficult to appreciate when a plant closes in a small community because of increased foreign competition . '' 
"
"Pity Barack Obama 's economic advisers . 
The blogs are now demanding their scalps , and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and his colleagues face a nasty dilemma : There are no solutions to the banking crisis without extraordinary political and financial risks . 
Thus , they have adopted a three-pronged approach , delay , delay , delay , in the hope that somebody comes up with a breakthrough . 
Here 's the problem : Today 's true market value of the U.S. banks ' toxic assets -LRB- that ugly stuff that needs to be removed from bank balance sheets before the economy can recover -RRB- amounts to between 5 and 30 cents on the dollar . 
To remain solvent , however , the banks say they need a valuation of 50 to 60 cents on the dollar . 
Translation : as much as another $ 2 trillion taxpayer bailout . 
That kind of expensive solution could send the president 's approval rating into a nose dive . 
Consider : $ 2 trillion is about two-thirds of the tax revenue the federal government collects each year . 
The logical alternative -- talk show hosts ' solution du jour -- is to temporarily restructure or nationalize the banks and leave taxpayers alone . 
Remove the toxic assets , replace management and cut the too-big-to-fail financial dinosaurs into smaller , nimbler entities . 
Then reprivatize these smaller banks and let the recovery begin . 
Oh , if it were that simple . 
I suspect Obama 's advisers would like nothing more than to dismantle an irresponsible firm such as Citigroup . 
They are afraid to do so , for one reason : All the big banks are connected to a potentially lethal web of paper insurance instruments called credit default swaps . 
These paper derivatives have become our financial system 's new master . 
The theory holds that dismantling a big bank could unravel this paper market , with catastrophic global financial consequences . 
Nobody knows , because the market for these unregulated financial derivatives , amounting potentially to over $ 40 trillion -LRB- by comparison , global gross domestic product is now not much more than $ 60 trillion -RRB- , is the financial equivalent of uncharted waters . 
Geithner has reason to be terrified . 
He was part of the Henry Paulson-led team that underestimated the devastating global-contagion effect of the collapse of Lehman Brothers . 
Geithner wo n't make the mistake of underestimation again . 
Geithner also knows that the mood in Congress has changed . 
Were a global financial brush fire to break out as a result of bank restructuring or nationalization , today 's populist Congress might just let it burn . 
Congressional anger is likely to intensify when policymakers realize that credit default swaps demand a stream of premium payments like a life insurance policy , not just a payment due at termination . 
And recent signs indicate that firms such as Citigroup , in recycling their taxpayer bailout funding , may have helped other financial firms , including some in Europe , meet these payment obligations . 
In addition , Geithner worries that because the troubled insurance giant American International Group -LRB- AIG -RRB- is a conduit for the banks ' use of credit default swaps , a collapse of AIG -LRB- as an unintended consequence of dismantling the big banks -RRB- could be catastrophic . 
AIG 's more than 300 million terrified holders of insurance-related investments and pension funds , who have investments totaling $ 20 trillion -LRB- U.S. GDP is $ 14 trillion -RRB- , could suddenly rush for redemptions -- the equivalent of a run on a bank . 
Geithner would face a worldwide insurance collapse to accompany his global banking collapse . 
Or again , maybe not . 
Here 's another likely Geithner fear -- that Congress forces the banks ' bondholders to take a hit . 
So far , only stockholders have lost out because of the banking crisis . 
One reason for the fragility in the credit default swap market of late is that markets fear that bank bondholders , who today are protected even before U.S. taxpayers , could soon see their status change . 
The worry is that if even bondholders are put at risk , U.S. and foreign investors alike would stop financing all corporate America . 
The administration says that wo n't happen , but market participants believe -LRB- probably correctly -RRB- that this White House ca n't control Congress . 
So our Treasury secretary has no choice but to talk of bank stress-testing and other tactics to buy time before the big bank bailout . 
Notice that the president 's budget already contains a contingency fund of up to $ 750 billion for a future bank bailout -- a politically shrewd number that roughly matches the size of the Paulson bailout . 
The true cost is likely to be two or three times as much , unless some last-minute intellectual breakthrough -- a tax holiday for derivatives ? 
The Obama team needs to remember that we got into this mess because of a lack of financial transparency . 
It 's time to tell the American people what the stock market already knows : that the path to recovery will probably be expensive and politically unpopular , perhaps explosively so . 
This dire situation could take us all down , which is why Obama should name a proven , world-class problem-solver who is not from Wall Street as his bank workout czar . 
James Baker , the former Republican secretary of state and Treasury secretary , comes to mind . 
Other possibilities : former Democratic senators Bill Bradley or George Mitchell . 
Perhaps the White House should name a team . 
In the end , at least one thing is certain : Our present position is unsustainable . 
The longer we delay fixing the banks , the faster the economy deleverages , the more credit dries up , the further the stock market falls , the higher the ultimate bank bailout price tag for the American taxpayer , and the more we risk falling into a financial black hole from which escape could take decades .

"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday laid out his most comprehensive vision yet for how to overhaul the rules governing the nation 's financial system , and advocated changing accounting methods that he said have exacerbated the financial crisis . 
Appearing before the Council on Foreign Relations , Bernanke said the financial system must be regulated `` as a whole , in a holistic way '' to avoid some of the failures that have led to the current meltdown -- which he called `` the worst financial crisis since the 1930s . '' 
He said policymakers must better supervise institutions perceived as too big to fail and consider requiring firms to set aside more capital so that they have it when economic conditions worsen . 
`` These crises have revealed some rather shocking gaps in our regulatory oversight , '' Bernanke said . 
`` I mean , who was overseeing the subprime lenders , for example ? 
Who was overseeing AIG ? 
There simply was n't enough adequate oversight in those cases . '' 
In comments on a subject that is drawing increasing scrutiny , Bernanke said current accounting standards need to be revised so they do n't amplify the negative effects of a downturn . 
Rules underlying what is known as `` mark-to-market '' or `` fair-value '' accounting now require companies to disclose the value of certain types of assets based on what buyers would pay for them if they were to be sold now . 
But because buyers have fled the marketplace , driving down prices , companies have been forced to write down the value of their assets , even if they do n't plan to sell them for years . 
Mark-to-market rules are intended to give investors a clear and accurate picture of the value of a company 's assets . 
Bernanke said that remained an appropriate system , but he said policymakers `` should look to identify the weak points of mark-to-market and try to make some improvements on a more expeditious basis . '' 
That would likely mean that certain kinds of assets now valued at their market price would instead be valued according to their underlying economic value , which is generally higher . 
On Capitol Hill , where the American Bankers Association and other trade groups have been pushing for changes to mark-to-market accounting , Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , echoed Bernanke 's views and said lawmakers are nudging regulators to explore the possibility of implementing new guidelines . 
A Financial Services subcommittee has scheduled a hearing on the issue for tomorrow . 
`` The mark-to-market rule has clearly got to be made better in its workings . 
There has to be more flexibility in its application , '' Frank said . 
`` There has to be discretion in what the consequences are . '' 
Bernanke touched on a host of other regulatory challenges in a wide-ranging speech that mapped out the ways in which stronger oversight of the financial system could help avert crises on the magnitude of the current one . 
Among the most sweeping changes lawmakers are considering is the creation of a regulator to monitor firms that pose a systemic risk because they are so interconnected with other firms . 
The idea of a systemic risk regulator has been around for a while but has taken on new urgency following the failure of Lehman Brothers and the government takeover of insurance giant American International Group , which was brought down mainly because of losses generated by an unregulated unit based in London . 
The Fed is the leading candidate to take on the job of systemic risk regulator because its already oversees bank holding companies and serves as the lender of last resort . 
Some analysts and lawmakers have objected to the Fed taking on more responsibility because it is already stretched thin . 
Bernanke responded to those concerns by saying Congress would be able to define the central bank 's role . 
Ann Owen , a former Fed economist , interpreted Bernanke 's comments as an argument for `` a more defined system to give them more authority to do this . '' 
`` I do n't see how you can set up some systemic risk authority that operates independent from the Fed because at the end of the day , if there needs to be lender of last resort , it needs to be the Fed , '' she said . 
At various points , Bernanke referred to the global nature of financial markets and the current crisis . 
He urged coordination with bank regulators abroad but stopped short of endorsing an international financial regulatory regime -- an idea that has been pushed by some European leaders . 
The issue is likely to come up when the G-20 meets in a few weeks in London . 
Bernanke avoided specifics during his speech , merely making suggestions that could be taken up later by Congress . 
But that approach left some analysts wanting . 
`` The issue is how do we get from Point A to Point B and what role should the Fed play , '' said Steven Davidoff , a law professor and an expect on securities regulation . 
`` Nothing he 's saying is not already in the works or being discussed in Congress or at the White House level . '' 
Indeed , few of the policy ideas he offered were new . 
The accounting rule changes , for example , are `` on everybody 's list , '' said Hal S. Scott , a Harvard Law professor and director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation , a group of academics and finance industry leaders . 
`` Our committee is looking at it . 
Every other group I know that is looking at the financial crisis is looking at it . '' 
However , analysts said there was value in the Fed chairman acknowledging the consensus that has emerged among academics , former regulators and lawmakers about overhauling financial regulation . 
`` That 's a good thing . 
If you compared this to -LRB- Alan -RRB- Greenspan 's speeches ... the world has changed , '' Davidoff said . 
`` Greenspan was not a pro-regulatory force , and now we have someone advocating regulation across the board . '' 
After his speech , Bernanke was asked when he expected the economy would recover . 
`` My forecasting record is about the same as the win-loss record of the Washington Nationals , '' he said . 
`` We will eventually recover . 
There 's no question , '' he added . 
`` There 's too many underlying strengths . 
It 's too dynamic an economy . 
It 's a question of whether it happens quickly or less quickly . ''

"For all the legislative commotion surrounding the economic crisis , we are still living in the equivalent of `` the phony war '' of 1939 and 1940 . 
War has been declared on the Great Recession , but it 's basically politics as usual . 
The bickering and mismanagement that helped create the crisis are continuing , even though we elected a president who promised a new start . 
History tells us that phony war does n't last forever and that when it ends , all hell breaks loose . 
World War II officially began with Germany 's September 1939 attack on Poland , but for months it was just skirmishing on the sidelines . 
That hiatus ended on May 10 , 1940 , when Hitler invaded Belgium and its neighbors . 
Neville Chamberlain was out as British prime minister , and Winston Churchill arrived as the avenging angel . 
We 're still in the Neville Chamberlain phase when it comes to the economic crisis . 
The government is talking about sacrifice and solutions , but it has n't yet made the tough decisions that will put the economy back together . 
Economist David Smick had it right in The Post this week when he said the administration had a three-pronged strategy : delay , delay and delay . 
The administration announces a rescue package but does n't deliver details ; it promises budget discipline but saves the hard decisions for later . 
One reason this season feels so political is that Obama has stacked his administration with politicians and former government officials . 
You might think that with the greatest financial crisis of his lifetime , the president would want a few business leaders with experience managing large organizations in crisis . 
Here 's the un-businesslike Obama Cabinet : At Treasury , a former government official ; at State , a former senator ; at Commerce , a former governor ; at Defense , a former government official and university president ; at Energy , a former professor ; at Homeland Security , a former governor ; at Health and Human Services , a former governor ; at the White House as chief of staff , a former congressman ; at the White House as economic czar , a former university president and government official . 
All fine people , no doubt . 
But as thin on business experience as a Hyde Park book club . 
Maybe Obama sees business executives as too tainted by the financial crisis to be useful , or confirmable . 
The closest he comes is Paul Volcker 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board -- which includes Jeffrey Immelt , chief executive of GE ; Jim Owens , chief executive of Caterpillar ; and venture capitalist John Doerr . 
The culture of immobilism starts on Capitol Hill . 
These people are still working a four-day week , taking Fridays off so they can run home and tell constituents how diligent they are . 
They may talk about a crisis , but they do n't act like it 's real . 
Republicans and Democrats are sticking to party-line votes on many key issues . 
The Democrats were egregious in packing the stimulus bill with pet projects that wo n't stimulate much except campaign contributions and in sticking with earmarks -- a symbolic outrage that Obama promised during the campaign he would eliminate . 
But the Republicans have been even worse in their strategy of opposing recovery plans , which has given a legislative face to Rush Limbaugh 's `` I hope he fails . '' 
The legislative pettifoggery was captured by a New York Times headline this week : `` Obama 's Budget Faces Challenge by Party Barons ; Panel Chairmen Oppose a Tax Plan but Want to Reduce Debt . '' 
This nonsense has to stop , folks . 
The party 's over . 
What will happen if Obama 's efforts fail ? 
That 's the question that really worries me when I think about history . 
During the 1930s , European politicians failed to solve the economic crisis through normal democratic means . 
So the public turned elsewhere . 
People became so angry with bankers and business tycoons , and with the bickering parliamentarians , that they turned to authoritarian leaders who promised national action -- in the form of fascism . 
That nightmare scenario may seem far off today . 
But there 's an ugly mood developing , as people start looking for villains to blame for the economic mess . 
Obama administration officials are understandably nervous about taking a leap in the dark -- imposing emergency financial measures that could mean bankruptcy and nationalization for big automakers and giant banks . 
I hope they will find more creative , market-oriented approaches that break up the giants rather than patch them together under government ownership . 
But the phony war has to end . 
The public is demanding action , and if this set of politicians does n't provide it , they may turn to a scarier bunch .

"President Obama appears serenely confident as he goes about fixing the worst global financial crisis in more than half a century while simultaneously revamping the national health-care system , changing the way Americans use and produce energy , giving tax breaks to 95 percent of all households , and seeking `` a cure for cancer in our time . '' 
Obama is not the first American leader to lay out a vision that seems improbably ambitious . 
George W. Bush did the same thing in seeking to establish a democratic foothold in the heart of the Middle East by launching a war against Iraq -- even as the United States was tied down fighting a war in Afghanistan with a military force that many experts warned was too small . 
It 's easy to be skeptical about overconfidence , especially in hindsight , but what makes it interesting is that history is full of examples of leaders who accomplished improbable things largely because they thought they could -- when everyone said they could n't . 
Stanford University psychologist Deborah Gruenfeld once got to thinking about power during an airplane trip on which she was stuck between two other passengers in economy class . 
The man on one side , a high-powered type sporting a blue suit , a giant gold watch and a ton of swagger , reached up and turned on his air vent so it blasted cold air directly on her . 
She sat in her cramped middle seat , getting colder and colder , her contact lenses getting dryer and dryer , until she realized she could just reach up and turn the vent off . 
Gruenfeld later asked herself why she had not acted sooner -- why she felt deprived of control . 
In a nice demonstration of making a lemon into lemonade , Gruenfeld turned her experience into an experiment : She had one group of volunteers recall a time in their lives when they felt powerful and another group recall a time when they felt powerless . 
All of them were then seated in a room uncomfortably close to a fan blasting air at them . 
Those who had been reminded of feeling powerful tended to switch off the fan or divert the blast . 
The poor volunteers who had recalled feeling powerless mostly sat and shivered . 
Gruenfeld and others have shown in this and other experiments that the central characteristic of power is not that it triggers optimism , self-esteem and action -- all of which are true -- but that it produces a sense of control . 
This may be especially true of those who , like Obama , rise quickly from relative obscurity to great prominence . 
Power can prompt people to venture into domains where they actually possess very little control . 
Those who feel powerless , by contrast , mentally constrain themselves and believe they have less control than they actually do . 
Adam Galinsky , a psychologist at Northwestern University who has conducted a number of experiments with Gruenfeld , said human accomplishment appears to be at least as much about `` cans '' and `` cannots '' as it is about `` haves '' and `` have-nots . '' 
If power tends to corrupt and sometimes leads to arrogance , it also allows people to conceive of possibilities that the powerless can not imagine . 
In an experiment reported in Psychological Science and led by Nathanael Fast , a graduate student at Stanford , the researchers showed that power produces such strong feelings of control that people can come to believe they can control things that are literally uncontrollable : Volunteers made to feel powerful felt they had more control over rolling dice than those who felt powerless . 
This might explain something about the CEOs who helped trigger the ongoing financial meltdown by taking disastrously aggressive risks . 
Financial titans may believe they can get away with extraordinary risks for no better reason than that they happen to be financial titans . 
Between 1998 and 2001 , shareholders of companies that acquired other companies lost $ 240 billion of value after the merger announcements , according to research by Sara B. Moeller at the University of Pittsburgh and others . 
And an unusual 15-year analysis conducted by Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate at the University of California found that personal overconfidence among CEOs appeared to be a potent predictor of excessively risky takeovers . 
Overconfidence among business leaders appears to have much in common with the fairy-tale stories of princesses who transform toads into handsome princes by bestowing their kisses . 
In one of his legendary letters to shareholders , Warren Buffett quipped that `` many managerial princesses remain serenely confident about the future potency of their kisses -- even after their corporate backyards are knee-deep in unresponsive toads . '' 
A final piece of the power puzzle : People who suddenly gain power after a long spell of powerlessness seem especially prone to outlandish ambition , according to a study led by Niro Sivanathan at the London Business School and published last year in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes . 
Does all this spell disaster for Obama and Democrats in Congress , who have both rocketed from the wilderness to near-total power ? 
The paradox that the research reveals about power is that overconfidence in one 's ability to control things explains both the greatest triumphs and the worst failures of leadership . 
Hubris may just be the name we give to visionaries who fail . 
Vision may be the name we give to hubris that succeeds . 
Interested in how ideas in the social sciences can speak to policy , politics and the unusual creatures that populate Washington ?

"Jon Stewart Puts Jim Cramer , and CNBC , on the Defensive Jim Cramer , left , host of CNBC 's `` Mad Money , '' underwent a withering cross-examination Thursday from Jon Stewart on `` The Daily Show . '' 
-LRB- By Jason Decrow -- Associated Press -RRB- Jon Stewart has amassed a passionate following over the years as a sharp-edged satirist , the man who punctures the balloons of the powerful with a caustic candor that reporters can not muster . 
As public furor over the economic meltdown rises , the Comedy Central star has turned not just his humor but also his full-throated outrage against financial journalists who he says aided and abetted the likes of Bear Stearns , AIG and Citigroup -- especially those who work for the nation 's top business news channel . 
Stewart morphed into a populist avenging angel this week , demanding to know why CNBC and its most manic personality , Jim Cramer , failed to warn the public about the risky Wall Street conduct that triggered the financial crisis . 
`` It 's bigger than CNBC , '' said Jeff Jarvis , who teaches journalism at the City University of New York . 
`` As anger rolls across the land about the mess we 're in , it 's also hitting people who cover the financial world ... CNBC is the easiest target if you 're doing comedy . '' 
In his much-ballyhooed `` Daily Show '' face-off with Cramer on Thursday , Stewart accused the network of peddling `` snake oil . '' 
`` Listen , you knew what the banks were doing , '' Stewart said . 
`` And yet were touting it for months and months -- the entire network was . 
So now to pretend that this was some sort of crazy , once-in-a-lifetime tsunami that no one could have seen coming was disingenuous at best and criminal at worst . '' 
Cramer , a former hedge-fund manager known for his bombastic style , sounded apologetic at times , saying he had made mistakes and wished he and the network had done a better job . 
`` I had a lot of CEOs lie to me on the show . 
It 's very painful , '' the `` Mad Money '' host said . 
Video of the interview immediately went viral and was prominently played across the Web , giving it exposure that exceeds Stewart 's television audience , which reached 2.3 million this week . 
Much of the public , especially on the left , came to resent news organizations for not reporting more aggressively on the Bush administration 's march to war in Iraq . 
Stewart 's criticism might tap into similar sentiments across the political spectrum about media complacency during the housing and credit bubble , especially since news outlets were widely accused of boosterism after the late 1990s tech boom that went bust . 
The showdown with Cramer came eight days after Stewart blistered CNBC for offering bland assurances about the health of investment banks and for soft interviews such as one last year with R. Allen Stanford , who was asked : `` Is it fun being a billionaire ? '' 
Stanford was charged last month in an alleged $ 8 billion fraud . 
Cramer has told colleagues he felt blindsided by Stewart 's hostile approach . 
But many CNBC staffers were furious with Cramer yesterday for failing to defend the network 's reporting or to criticize Stewart 's video clips as selectively edited or out of context . 
CNBC declined all interview requests , saying in a statement : `` CNBC produces more than 150 hours of live television a week that includes more than 850 interviews in the service of exposing all sides of every critical financial and economic issue . 
We are proud of our record . '' 
Cramer used an analogy to the college basketball playoffs to depict himself as the underdog . 
`` When you are a Big East team and you are 16th seed in the Western Regional , you just want to leave with your head intact , '' he said by e-mail . 
`` When I walked out , I checked in the mirror . 
It was still attached . 
So I am thrilled to have been in the tourney . '' 
Business journalists generally failed to anticipate the magnitude of the Wall Street collapse , reporting elements of the growing risks but rarely trumpeting the threat on the front pages or network newscasts . 
And CNBC , a fixture on Wall Street , is hardly the only news organization to fall short in the run-up to the crisis .

"Search for new homes , condos , and other real estate in Washington , D.C. , Maryland and Virginia . 
While policymakers and policy kibitzers , among whom I count myself , debate what is needed to cure the current crisis and recession , another debate brews in the background . 
It is about how to fix the system so that this does n't happen again . 
Any coherent proposal for fixing the system is based on judgments about the causes of the crisis . 
While there are many differences in emphasis , I believe that most observers would agree on the essentials : The crisis originated with a bubble in the residential real estate market , followed by the inevitable aftermath of declining home prices , and a subsequent explosion of home mortgage defaults and foreclosures . 
The resulting losses were worldwide , because foreign investors held enormous amounts of U.S. mortgage-related assets . 
Financial institutions did not have the capital to absorb these losses , resulting in the collapse of many and the enormous infusion of capital by governments , plus loans and guarantees , to prevent the collapse of many more . 
This sequence of events could be prevented by blocking the bubble , or by shoring up the capacity of the financial system to absorb the losses resulting from a bubble 's collapse . 
In my opinion , the second option should have priority . 
We do n't know where the next bubble will come from , but if the system has enough capital , a crisis can be averted no matter its source . 
Private financial institutions will never voluntarily carry enough capital to cover the losses that would occur under a disaster scenario . 
For one thing , such disasters occur infrequently , and as the period since the last occurrence gets longer , the natural tendency is to disregard it -- to treat it as having a zero probability . 
In a study of international banking crises , finance professor Richard Herring and I called this `` disaster myopia . '' 
Disaster myopia is reinforced by `` herding . '' 
Any one firm that elects to play it safe will be less profitable than its peers , making its shareholders unhappy and even opening itself to a possible takeover . 
Furthermore , even if those controlling financial firms knew the probability of a severe shock , and the large losses that would result from it , it is not in their interest to hold the capital needed to meet those losses . 
Because they do n't know when the shock will occur , playing it safe would mean reduced earnings for the firm and reduced personal income for them for what could be a very long time . 
Better to realize the higher income as long as possible , because if they stay within the law , the money wo n't be taken from them when the firm becomes insolvent . 
Indeed , insolvency may not mean the demise of the firm if many firms are affected at the same time . 
Governments ca n't allow them all to fail without allowing the crisis to become a catastrophe . 
This is clearly borne out by the U.S. government 's actions in the current crisis . 
Bailouts by the government further validate the premise that it is foolhardy for a financial firm to hold the capital needed to meet the losses associated with a severe shock . 
This appears to lead logically to the conclusion that government ought to impose capital requirements on financial firms . 
Capital requirements stipulate the amount of capital firms must have , based largely on the amounts and types of assets and liabilities they have . 
Unfortunately , capital requirements wo n't prevent financial crises . 
An inherent flaw in capital requirements is that required capital varies by broad asset categories , which allows the regulated firms to replace less risky assets with more risky assets within any given asset class . 
The shift to subprime mortgages during the last bubble , for example , did not increase their required capital . 
In principle , regulators can offset this by adjusting requirements in response to changing economic conditions . 
For this to work , however , regulators must have better foresight than those they regulate , which they do n't . 
An increase in capital requirements large enough to burst a bubble would be extremely disruptive , forcing many firms to sell stock at the same time , or to substantially reduce their lending . 
Concerns about such disruptions reinforce disaster myopia and political timidity among regulators . 
That 's easy to prove . 
Banks and other depository institutions have been subject to capital requirements since the 1980s , but no adjustments in the requirements were made in response to the recent housing bubble .

"Options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb made his name and career anticipating the powerful historic events he calls `` Black Swans , `` which include World War I , the rise of the Internet and the stock market crash of 1987 . 
In two books published in 2001 and 2007 , he urges readers to concentrate more on what they do n't know than on what they do . 
More recently , Taleb has blasted bankers and economists who issued reassuring forecasts right up to the brink of the current global financial crisis . 
He spoke recently with Washington Post reporter Peter Whoriskey . 
Excerpts : You 're a fierce critic of the entire field of economics . 
Do n't economists know anything ? 
You have close to a million people out there in economic life . 
How many people saw the extent of what could happen in this financial crisis ? 
Some people said we 'd have a problem of too much leverage , but very few saw the potential total impact that could come out of it . 
They did n't see the cascading effects that can be produced by a complex system . 
Years ago , I noticed one thing about economics , and that is that economists did n't get anything right . 
I wanted to find out the reason . 
They would say their models are not perfect . 
But data show that you do much worse using their models than you would without them . 
It 's a bull -LRB- expletive -RRB- science . 
Can you give a specific example ? 
Every time I saw -LRB- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben -RRB- Bernanke -LRB- on television -RRB- , I would have a fit of rage . 
He claimed that we were in a period of `` great moderation . '' 
He did not understand that Black Swans are preceded by low volatility and the buildup of hidden risks . 
He mistook absence of volatility for the absence of risk . 
It was like someone sitting on dynamite and saying `` It 's okay , we 're safe because nothing has happened . '' 
In a complex system , things that are fragile should be allowed to fail very fast . 
-LRB- Former Fed Chairman Alan -RRB- Greenspan and Bernanke let something fragile , like the banks , survive very long . 
The longer it takes to break , the worse the outcome . 
That 's why I think Obama needs to start with a new economic team -- Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Lawrence Summers were among those who did n't see this coming in the first place . 
He needs new people who understand complex systems . 
What about economist Nouriel Roubini ? 
Was n't he calling attention to the potential danger ?

"The Officer Should Eat Last As a sign of how much the financial crisis and now economic recession has upended our world , we are now talking about volunteered pay cuts . 
Just imagine the reaction to a sports coach or company manager demanding less pay , not more , at the height of a winning season or the financial bubble . 
Ludicrous or worse might have come to mind , perhaps enough to question the leader 's fitness for the job . 
How much the world has changed . 
Now , some executives are foregoing pay raises and even bonuses , though shocking executive payouts at Merrill Lynch and AIG remind us that the forgoers are yet the exceptions who have not disproved the first rule of unfettered capitalism : more is better . 
At a time when millions of non-executives are facing wage reductions , forced furloughs , and outright dismissals , all amounting to a sharp if not complete loss of income , company executives would be wise to take their pay lumps too , for two reasons . 
First , equity is a defining quality of our workplace culture , which translates into the widely shared perception that a person should be fairly paid for the work performed . 
When corporate performance crashes , as a matter of equity those most responsible for it should give back much of their compensation - and not wait for a claw back . 
Second , selfless behavior is a defining quality of effective leadership . 
The `` officer eats last , '' is the Marine Corps ' way of saying so , as was the Civil War adage for cavalry commanders , `` feed your horses , feel your men , then feed yourself . '' 
Too many executives fed themselves first , questioning their credibility in good times and destroying it now in bad times . 
This is a good moment for company executives to take a pay cut for both reasons . 
When Warren Buffett agreed to take the helm at Salomon Brothers in 1991 , after it was rocked by an enormous trading scandal , he insisted on an annual salary of one dollar . 
He did not personally need the money , of course , but was making a more powerful statement about his leadership than words could ever convey . 
If his leadership proved successful , he stood to gain , but he would only gain if it proved successful .

"Aided by Financial Crisis , China Snaps Up Natural Resources Worldwide SHANGHAI -- Chinese companies have been on a shopping spree in the past month , snapping up tens of billions of dollars ' worth of key assets in Iran , Brazil , Russia , Venezuela , Australia and France in a global fire sale set off by the financial crisis . 
The deals have allowed China to lock up supplies of oil , minerals , metals and other strategic natural resources it needs to continue to fuel its growth . 
The sheer scope of the agreements marks a shift in global finance , roiling energy markets and feeding worries about the future availability and prices of those commodities in other countries that compete for them , including the United States . 
Just a few months ago , many countries were greeting such overtures from China with suspicion . 
Today , as corporations and banks in other parts of the world find themselves reluctant or unable to give out money to distressed companies , cash-rich China has become a major force driving new lending and investment . 
On Feb. 12 , China 's state-owned metals giant Chinalco signed a $ 19.5 billion deal with Australia 's Rio Tinto that will eventually double its stake in the world 's second-largest mining company . 
In three other cases , China has used loans as a way of securing energy supplies . 
On Feb. 17 and 18 , China National Petroleum signed separate agreements with Russia and Venezuela under which China would provide $ 25 billion and $ 4 billion in loans , respectively , in exchange for long-term commitments to supply oil . 
And on Feb. 19 , the China Development Bank struck a similar deal with Petrobras , the Brazilian oil company , agreeing to a loan of $ 10 billion in exchange for oil . 
On Saturday , Iran announced that it had signed a $ 3.2 billion agreement with a Chinese consortium to develop an area beneath the Persian Gulf seabed that is believed to hold about 8 percent of the world 's reserves of natural gas . 
Even as global financial flows have slowed sharply overall , China has dramatically stepped up its outbound investment . 
In 2008 , its overseas mergers and acquisitions were worth $ 52.1 billion -- a record , according to the research firm Dealogic . 
In January and February of this year , Chinese companies invested $ 16.3 billion abroad , meaning that if the pace holds , the total for 2009 could be nearly double last year 's . 
Worldwide , the value of mergers and acquisitions transactions so far this year has dropped 35 percent to $ 384 billion . 
By comparison , the United States had $ 186.2 billion in outbound mergers and acquisitions in 2008 and Japan had $ 74.3 billion . 
China 's state-run media outlets are calling the acquisition spree an opportunity that comes once in a hundred years , and analysts are drawing parallels to 1980s Japan . 
`` That China started investing or acquiring some overseas mineral resources companies with relatively low prices during the global economic crisis is quite a normal practice . 
Japan did the same thing in its prime development period , too , '' said Xu Xiangchun , consulting director for Mysteel.com , a market research and analysis firm . 
It 's not just Chinese corporations that are taking advantage of the economic crisis to help others while helping themselves . 
The Chinese government also has come to the rescue of ailing countries , such as Jamaica and Pakistan , that it wants as allies , extending generous loans . 
Even Chinese consumers are taking their money abroad . 
In a shopping trip last month organized by an online real estate brokerage , a group of 50 individual investors from China traveled to New York , Los Angeles and San Francisco to purchase homes at prices that have crashed since the subprime crisis .

"France , Germany Unite to Urge Fiscal Discipline PARIS , March 17 -- France and Germany appealed to fellow European nations Tuesday to take the lead in emphasizing tighter regulation and `` a new global financial architecture '' to combat the world economic crisis and prevent new ones . 
The appeal , in an unusual joint letter from French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , underscored the determination of Europe 's major economic players to reform the world financial system as fast as possible and to keep emergency government spending on national stimulus plans as low as possible despite the crisis . 
Those emphases have raised differences in priorities with the Obama administration and Britain , both of which have resolved to stimulate their economies into recovery through increased spending and have shown a willingness to incur mounting debt to get the job done . 
Some U.S. officials have suggested that other European governments , including France and Germany , should get onto the same sheet of music because of the gravity of the situation , despite E.U. rules mandating fiscal discipline . 
The differences in approach and priorities have been lingering behind the scenes in preparations for the Group of 20 economic summit scheduled for April 2 in London , which will be the first stop in President Obama 's first official trip to Europe and a milestone in efforts to shake off the global economic crisis . 
`` Overall , the positions of the Germans and French and those of the United States have become much closer in the last couple of years , '' said Roland Doehrn , an economist at Germany 's Rhine-Westphalia Institute for Economic Research . 
`` But each country has the interests of its own traditions at heart . '' 
The joint letter was addressed to Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek of the Czech Republic , which has the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union . 
It urged the European Union , at a summit scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Brussels , to take a clear stand in favor of sweeping financial reforms for presentation as a unified European demand at the G-20 summit in the face of whatever hesitations Britain and the United States might have . 
`` The first priority is to build a new global financial architecture , '' Sarkozy and Merkel said . 
`` The European Union must affirm a common position and take the lead on this subject . '' 
In particular , the two leaders said , Europe should go to London with proposals for new regulation and supervision of hedge funds and other high-risk investments and legal tools to act against tax havens that refuse to lift bank-secrecy laws . 
The first steps in increased regulation and supervision should be taken by June , they said , suggesting the G-20 summit should issue specific recommendations on what to do rather than vague principles and promises to work together . 
But beyond that , the two leaders also described a longer-term effort to redesign the world financial system as suggested by Sarkozy as far back as September , when the extent of the crisis was unclear . 
`` The European Union should support a new charter of sustainable economic activity as a framework for the work of governments and international institutions , '' they said . 
`` It should be based on market principles while at the same time aiming to ensure a stable world economy , socially balanced and respectful of sustainable development . 
Over time , it should culminate in establishment of a world governance structure . '' 
Reflecting in particular German concerns about fiscal irresponsibility , the leaders acknowledged that the depth of the crisis required deviation from E.U. budgetary restraints laid out in the union 's Stability and Growth Pact . 
But they said exceptions to the rules should be ended as soon as the emergency subsides lest long-term stability be threatened . 
An aide to Sarkozy , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject , said the emphasis on fiscal discipline reflected a desire `` by Germany and some of our other partners '' to make it clear that recent economic stimulus plans `` should not in any way be interpreted as an abandonment of strong budgetary discipline .

"How the Fed Failed to Tell Obama About The Bonuses Federal Reserve officials knew for months about bonuses at American International Group but failed to tell the Obama administration , according to government and company officials , exposing problems in a relationship that is vital to addressing the financial crisis . 
As pressure mounted on AIG employees to return the bonuses , new details emerged yesterday about what the Fed , the Treasury Department and the White House knew regarding the payments and when . 
AIG executives said the Fed was informed three months ago by the company that it would pay $ 165 million by March 15 to employees working at its most troubled division . 
The Treasury and White House said they learned of the payments from Fed officials only days before they were due . 
Close coordination between the Fed and the administration is now more important than ever as they near the launch of two signature programs to rescue the financial system , which together could reach $ 2 trillion and are aimed at reviving consumer lending and purchasing soured assets and loans from ailing banks . 
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner , a central figure in the decision to bail out AIG last fall as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , said in an interview yesterday that he had not been aware of the size of the bonuses and the timing of the payments . 
`` I was stunned when I learned how bad this was on Tuesday -LRB- March 10 -RRB- , '' Geithner said . 
`` I should n't have been in that position , but it 's my responsibility and I accept that . '' 
Two days later , Geithner told the White House . 
The last-minute disclosure irked some of the president 's senior advisers , but they refuse to point fingers now , saying the timing had little impact on the outcome or the president 's public statements this week . 
`` Would I have liked an earlier warning system on this ? 
Yeah , '' said David Axelrod , a senior White House adviser . 
`` Would it have markedly changed things ? 
The legal constraints are the legal constraints . '' 
One source familiar with the discussions said the company had provided details about the bonuses to senior Treasury officials at least a month ago . 
A Treasury spokesman said last night that was not true . 
Democrats and Republicans in Congress are increasingly questioning how Geithner could not have known about the bonuses , given his past role in AIG 's bailout , which has totaled more than $ 170 billion . 
`` I 'm sick and tired of hearing the administration and the Secretary of the Treasury say , ' I just found out about it , ' '' Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski -LRB- D-Pa . -RRB- 
The dispute over AIG 's payouts represents the most pressing controversy confronting the administration as it addresses the financial crisis . 
Some private firms say the furor has made them wary of joining the federal initiatives to help save the economy . 
Government officials add that the newly charged political environment will make it difficult to ask Congress for more rescue funds . 
When the government rescued AIG in mid-September , no one was more central to the decision than Geithner .

"The Recession Becomes Topic A in Popular Music Rugged N Raw 's `` I 'm Broke and Proud '' video , which finds gallows humor in the recession . 
-LRB- Youtube -RRB- For Neil Young 's next release , `` Fork in the Road , '' the venerated , if occasionally vexing , rocker has created a concept album about electric cars . 
But Young takes a detour on at least two tracks to work with a suddenly popular songwriting topic : the cratering economy . 
On `` Cough Up the Bucks , '' Young wonders , in his high , nasally whine : `` Where did all the money go ? '' 
And on the title track 's chorus , he turns indignant : `` There 's a bailout coming , but it 's not for you\/It 's for all those creeps hiding what they do . '' 
Young 's contributions are just two of the more recent entries to the rapidly expanding recession-music playlist . 
It 's a mix that 's spilling over with tunes by artists who sound dejected , determined , enraged , anxious and , occasionally , sort of amused by the financial meltdown . 
Indeed , the global financial crisis is providing fodder to all manner of musicians , from rock legends and country singers to folkies and rappers . 
Contributions from rappers are especially notable , with more and more hip-hop artists forgoing , or at least decreasing , lyrics about excessive materialism in favor of ones about the common man 's economic grind , as heard on recent songs by Jadakiss -LRB- `` Hard Times '' -RRB- , Cam ` ron -LRB- `` I Hate My Job '' -RRB- , Joell Ortiz -LRB- `` Bout My Money '' -RRB- and Willie Isz , a Georgia duo whose `` In the Red '' imagines a world without money . 
The members of Willie Isz have called the potent song a cross between John Lennon 's `` Imagine '' and the epochal Great Depression song `` Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? '' 
But it sounds more like a Southern-rap update of the Carter Family 's enduring 1930s anthem `` No Depression in Heaven , '' with Jneiro Jarel rapping : `` If everything was free , the world would be a better place\/For you and me\/Don ' t you agree ? 
There 's also `` Circulate '' by Young Jeezy , the Southern rap star who last year released a chart-topping album loaded with lyrics about economic struggle . 
Called `` The Recession '' -LRB- although at the time of its release , in September , economists had n't declared that the U.S. economy was in a recession -RRB- , the album marked a departure for the Atlanta rapper who became famous -- and , yes , rich -- spinning tales of dope boys living large . 
Although Jeezy did n't actually strip his lyrics of references to his Lamborghini , he was suddenly questioning his free-spending ways , rapping : `` Looking at my watch like it 's a bad investment . '' 
In an interview with XXL magazine , he explained that he was something like a hip-hop Suze Orman : `` When money was plentiful , I was the first one to tell you to stack it . 
Live your life with it . 
Now that money 's slowed up , I ` ma be the first one to tell you to save it like they ai n't gon ' make it no more . '' 
And yes , a wealthy rap star can still relate to the plight of the common man , Jeezy insisted . 
`` I got family members , aunts , uncles and cousins and friends that still live their life , '' he said . 
`` It definitely affects me when I get the phone calls and somebody 's about to get put out of their house ... somebody ca n't pay their bills and there ai n't really a lot of opportunity out there for you . '' 
In January , Nashville star John Rich dashed off `` Shuttin ' Detroit Down , '' a rant about the government 's hesitation to save the American automotive industry . 
`` In the real world , they 're shuttin ' Detroit down , '' Rich seethes . 
`` While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town\/And D.C. 's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground . '' 
Country singer-songwriter Phil Vassar seemed to have presaged the housing crisis when he was working up the title track of his 2008 album , `` Prayer of a Common Man . '' 
It 's a country-gospel ballad on which Vassar sings almost pleadingly : `` This house of cards I built is mortgaged to the hilt\/And it 's sinking in the sand\/Lord , hear the prayer of a common man . '' 
The old folkie Tom Paxton took a different approach in writing about federal bailouts , turning satirical on `` I 'm Changing My Name to Fannie Mae , '' an update of his topical 1979 song `` I 'm Changing My Name to Chrysler . ''

"The International Monetary Fund , under increasing pressure to reinvent itself , yesterday rolled out reforms that it said would make it more effective in combating the global economic crisis . 
World leaders will turn their attention to the role of the IMF when they meet next week in London for the G20 summit of industrialized and developing nations , and they are expected to reiterate support for increasing the IMF 's resources , though there are differences on how much those resources should be increased . 
The reforms offer the clearest picture to date of what the IMF would do with more resources . 
World leaders as well as IMF officials have been clamoring for additional funds for the organization as the scope of the economic crisis has grown . 
Since last fall , it has doled out more than $ 40 billion in aid and has access to about $ 300 billion . 
The European Union has pledged to kick in another $ 100 billion . 
The centerpiece of the reforms is a new line of credit that gives countries with well-managed economies the ability to borrow more money , faster and with no strings attached . 
The fund also doubles limits on the amount of money countries may receive through some of its other programs . 
The IMF wants to encourage more countries to seek its help as a precautionary measure rather than waiting until they 're in acute distress . 
The new programs may help countries in Eastern Europe that have been hit hard by the global downturn . 
Many countries in the region are suffering as demand for exports plunges and foreign investors retreat . 
The problems threaten the stability of the European banking system as a whole because banks in Western Europe lent heavily to consumers and businesses to the east . 
At the G20 summit , finance officials are hoping to forge a consensus over how much more money the fund needs . 
IMF and European Union officials say its resources should be expanded to $ 500 billion , while U.S. officials contend it needs more . 
The success of the IMF 's revamped approach depends on whether countries will participate . 
South Korea and Singapore have so far shunned IMF money because they did not like how the IMF handled the Asian financial crisis . 
Many countries in Latin America have also shunned IMF assistance because of past experiences with the organization . 
`` It 's not that the IMF instruments are no good , '' said Liliana Rojas-Suarez , a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development . 
But public perception of the IMF as a tool of U.S. policy ensures that `` Latin American countries are not going there . '' 
Even as the 65-year-old body is being asked to refashion itself to help solve the problems of a new financial era , China this week proposed yet another task for the IMF -- managing a new global reserve currency that would replace the U.S. dollar . 
The idea reflects growing Chinese unease over the impact of U.S. policies on its vast holdings of Treasury bills and other U.S. government debt . 
Joaqu n Almunia , the European Union official in charge of economic affairs , dismissed the idea . 
Last night , President Obama said , `` I do n't believe that there 's a need for a global currency . '' 
The IMF has repositioned itself periodically since its creation after World War II to oversee the exchange rate system established under the Bretton Woods agreements . 
That role ended in the 1970s , and in the 1980s , it emerged as the manager of the Latin American debt crisis . 
In the 1990s , the fund stepped in to deal with the Mexican and East Asian financial crises . 
In the past decade , a dearth of crises left it with little to do . 
IMF officials said the changes announced yesterday are a response to long-standing criticism that the organization imposes conditions on developing nations that are too harsh and even harmful to their economies . 
The flexible credit line replaces a credit line created last fall that had no takers because countries said it offered too little money and terms that were too inflexible . 
The changes also attempt to erase the stigma of weakness associated with taking IMF money that has kept many nations from asking for help until they are in dire straits . 
Analysts saw the reforms as significant but incremental . 
`` You do n't make it new overnight by changing some of the rules of the game unless you completely overhaul rules of the game , which this is not , '' said Carmen M. Reinhart , a former IMF official who is now an economics professor at the University of Maryland . 
Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , a left-leaning think tank , said the IMF has n't gone far enough in scaling back policy prescriptions it imposes on borrowers and that poorer countries and those that do not prequalify for the flexible credit line still face harsh conditions . 
`` It is worth noting that nobody wants to borrow from the IMF even with ` lighter ' conditionality , '' he said . 
`` Everyone who can avoid the IMF is doing so . 
This shows how governments are voting with their feet -- they still do n't want the IMF involved in their economic decision-making . '' 
Others said the IMF missed an opportunity to assist well-run countries hurt by the downturn while making it easier for countries with bad economic policies to borrow money .

"Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pressed Congress yesterday to give the federal government unprecedented new power to seize financial firms beyond banks whose collapse could jeopardize the world financial system . 
`` At best , the consequences of AIG 's failure would have been a significant intensification of an already severe financial crisis and a further worsening of global economic conditions , '' Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee . 
`` Conceivably , its failure could have resulted in a 1930s-style global financial and economic meltdown , with catastrophic implications for production , income and jobs . '' 
Despite those grave risks , the officials said , the government did not have the power to seize the insurance giant the way that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. can take over banks . 
`` No legal means existed under U.S. law to resolve AIG using the kind of powers available to the FDIC to resolve a bank , '' Geithner said of the federal bailout of AIG in September . 
`` Because of the absence of authority , your government was faced with no good options . '' 
Unless there is new legislation expanding the government 's control over non-bank entities , Geithner said , the current laws would `` continue to constrain our capacity to address future crises . '' 
While Geithner and Bernanke were unified in calling for new authority to wind down non-bank financial firms , the men have yet to agree on who should get this new power . 
Geithner has urged that the Treasury secretary be given this authority , although traditionally such resolution power has rested with bank regulatory agencies . 
Bernanke , however , suggested that `` the FDIC or some other body could be in charge of resolution and deals with those specific issues . '' 
Both men , however , agreed that the president should be involved in deciding whether and when to seize large , systemically important institutions . 
Steven Adamske , a spokesman for Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
, chairman of the committee , acknowledged the differences between the Fed and the Treasury 's proposals , but noted that the plan is `` still in its infancy . '' 
`` No decisions have been made , yet , '' he said `` We are a long way away from saying one proposal is better than the other . '' 
Even as Geithner and Bernanke made their pitch for extraordinary new power , many committee members remained more interested in venting their continued outrage over $ 165 million in retention bonuses that were paid out this month to executives at AIG Financial Products , the unit whose flawed derivatives contracts brought AIG to the brink of collapse and prompted a federal bailout . 
Geithner and Bernanke said they , too , shared the anger of the American people . 
Bernanke said he even considered filing a lawsuit to block the payments , but that the Federal Reserve 's lawyers advised against it on grounds that the government could face even larger costs if it lost . 
Bernanke said the dispute over AIG bonuses and other controversies dogging the government 's rescue efforts could have been avoided if federal officials had the authority to seize AIG last fall . 
`` That outcome would have been far preferable to the situation we find ourselves in now , '' he said .

"European Union President Criticizes Obama 's Economic Policies Members of the European Parliament vote on a package of bills . 
The Czech prime minister 's comments about U.S. policies angered some legislators . 
-LRB- Christian Lutz - AP -RRB- BERLIN , March 25 -- The president of the European Union on Wednesday ripped the Obama administration 's economic policies , calling its deficit spending and bank bailouts `` a road to hell . '' 
The comments by Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek of the Czech Republic , which holds the E.U. 's rotating presidency , startled some U.S. and European officials , who are preparing for President Obama 's visit next month to several European cities , including Prague , the Czech capital . 
In an address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg , France , Topolanek abandoned diplomatic niceties and blasted Washington for approving a $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , which he said encouraged `` protectionist '' trade policies . 
He said the overall U.S. strategy for ending the recession would flood global markets with too many dollars and lead to bigger problems . 
`` All of these steps , these combinations and permanency , is the road to hell , '' Topolanek said . 
`` The United States did not take the right path . '' 
Topolanek 's critique came one day after his government was toppled by a no-confidence vote by opposition lawmakers in the Czech Parliament . 
Although he will remain prime minister for the time being , his shaky position at home raised questions about whether he could remain effective as the E.U. president until his country 's six-month term expires at the end of June . 
`` I think this was just an attempt to show he 's a force still to be reckoned with and not a walking-dead politician , '' said Katinka Barysch , deputy director at the Center for European Reform , a London research organization . 
`` For him to come out with his guns blazing does seem a bit odd . '' 
Topolanek 's words , however , underscored a fundamental divide that persists between the United States and many European countries over the best way to respond to the global financial crisis . 
U.S. officials have pressed their European counterparts to spend substantially more public money in an attempt to revive economic growth and global trade . 
Some countries , led by Germany , have strongly resisted , predicting that such a path could lead to unsustainable debts and runaway inflation . 
Luxembourg 's prime minister , Jean-Claude Juncker , who heads a coordinating body of countries that use the euro currency , said European countries had already spent enough to jumpstart their economies . 
`` The European stimulus plans are muscular , they are demanding , they are important in volume and in quality , '' Juncker said Wednesday in an interview with France 's Europe 1 Radio . 
He said there was `` no question '' that the European Union would reject requests from Obama to spend more . 
Obama begins his transatlantic mission next week with a stop in London for a summit of the Group of 20 leading industrialized countries . 
Many European leaders have said the primary goal of the summit should be to impose greater regulation and oversight on global financial markets , instead of more government spending . 
But the 27 member countries of the European Union have had difficulty expressing themselves with a single voice . 
Topolanek 's speech to the European Parliament angered some legislators , who rebuked him for presuming that all members of the European Union agreed with his harsh criticism of Washington , or the way he delivered it . 
`` You still have n't understood what the job of the E.U. presidency is , '' said Martin Schultz , a German legislator and leader of the Socialist bloc in the Parliament . 
Topolanek rushed back to Prague after his speech to tend to his fallen government . 
Other Czech officials played down his remarks and blamed translators for making them sound harsher than intended . 
`` I was there and listened to the speech in Czech and he never mentioned the word ` hell , ' '' Alexander Vondra , the deputy Czech prime minister , told reporters in Strasbourg .

"Desmond Lachman -- Welcome to America , the World 's Scariest Emerging Market Back in the spring of 1998 , when Boris Yeltsin was still at Russia 's helm , I led a group of global investors to Moscow to find out firsthand where the Russian economy was headed . 
My long career with the International Monetary Fund and on Wall Street had taken me to `` emerging markets '' throughout Asia , Eastern Europe and Latin America , and I thought I 'd seen it all . 
Yet I still recall the shock I felt at a meeting in Russia 's dingy Ministry of Finance , where I finally realized how a handful of young oligarchs were bringing Russia 's economy to ruin in the pursuit of their own selfish interests , despite the supposed brilliance of Anatoly Chubais , Russia 's economic czar at the time . 
At the time , I could not imagine that anything remotely similar could happen in the United States . 
Indeed , I shared the American conceit that most emerging-market nations had poorly developed institutions and would do well to emulate Washington and Wall Street . 
These days , though , I 'm hardly so confident . 
Many economists and analysts are worrying that the United States might go the way of Japan , which suffered a `` lost decade '' after its own real estate market fell apart in the early 1990s . 
But I 'm more concerned that the United States is coming to resemble Argentina , Russia and other so-called emerging markets , both in what led us to the crisis , and in how we 're trying to fix it . 
Over the past year , I 've been getting Russia flashbacks as I witness the AIG debacle as well as the collapse of Bear Sterns and a host of other financial institutions . 
Much like the oligarchs did in Russia , a small group of traders and executives at onetime venerable institutions have brought the U.S. and global financial systems to their knees with their reckless risk-taking -- with other people 's money -- for their personal gain . 
Negotiating with Argentina 's top officials during their multiple financial crises in the 1990s was always an ordeal , and sparring with Domingo Cavallo , the country 's Harvard-trained finance minister at the time , was particularly trying . 
One always had the sense that , despite their supreme arrogance , the country 's leaders never had a coherent economic strategy and that major decisions were always made on the run . 
I never thought that was how policy was made in the United States -- until , that is , I saw how totally at sea Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and Timothy F. Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke have appeared so many times during our country 's ongoing economic and financial storm . 
The parallels between U.S. policymaking and what we see in emerging markets are clearest in how we 've mishandled the banking crisis . 
We delude ourselves that our banks face liquidity problems , rather than deeper solvency problems , and we try to fix it all on the cheap just like any run-of-the-mill emerging market economy would try to do . 
And after years of lecturing Asian and Latin American leaders about the importance of consistency and transparency in sorting out financial crises , we fail on both counts : In March 2008 , one investment bank , Bear Stearns , is bailed out because it is thought to be too interconnected with the rest of the banking system to fail . 
However , six months later , another investment bank , Lehman Brothers -- for all intents and purposes indistinguishable from Bear Stearns in its financial market inter-connectedness -- is allowed to fail , with catastrophic effects on global financial markets . 
In visits to Asian capitals during the region 's financial crisis in the late 1990s , I often heard Asian reformers such as Singapore 's Lee Kuan Yew or Japan 's Eisuke Sakakibara complain about how the incestuous relationship between governments and large Asian corporate conglomerates stymied real economic change . 
How fortunate , I thought then , that the United States was not similarly plagued by crony capitalism ! 
However , watching Goldman Sachs 's seeming lock on high-level U.S. Treasury jobs as well as the way that Republicans and Democrats alike tiptoed around reforming Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae -- among the largest campaign contributors to Congress -- made me wonder if the differences between the United States and the Asian economies were only a matter of degree . 
On Wall Street there is an old joke that the longest river in the emerging-market economies is `` de Nile . '' 
Yet how often do U.S. leaders respond to growing signs of economic dysfunctionality by spouting nationalistic rhetoric that echoes the speeches of Latin American demagogues like Peru 's Alan Garcia in the 1980s and Argentina 's Carlos Menem in the 1990s ? 
-LRB- Even Garcia , currently in his second go-around as Peru 's president , seems to have grown up somewhat . -RRB- 
But instead of facing our problems we extol the resilience of the U.S. economy , praise the most productive workers in the world , and go on and on about America 's inherent ability to extricate itself from any crisis . 
And we ignore our proclivity as a nation to spend , year in year out , more than we produce , to put off dealing with long-term problems , and to engage in grandiose long-term programs that as a nation we can ill afford . 
A singular characteristic of an emerging market heading for deep trouble is a seemingly suicidal tendency to become overly indebted to foreign creditors . 
That tendency underlay the spectacular collapse of the Thai , Indonesian and Korean currencies in 1997 . 
It also led Russia to default on its debt in 1998 and plunged Argentina into its economic depression in 2001 . 
Yet we too seem to have little difficulty becoming increasingly indebted to the tune of a few hundred billion dollars a year . 
To make matters worse , we do so to countries like China , Russia and an assortment of Middle Eastern oil producers -- none of which is particularly well disposed to us . 
Like Argentina in its worst moments , we never seem to question whether it is reasonable to expect foreigners to keep financing our extravagance , and we forget the bad things that happen to the Argentinas or Hungarys of the world when foreigners stop financing their excesses . 
So instead of laying out a realistic plan for increasing our national savings , we choose not to face up to the Social Security and Medicare crises that lie ahead , embarking instead on massive spending programs that -- whatever their long-run merits might be -- we simply can not afford . 
After experiencing a few emerging-market crises , I get the sense of watching the same movie over and over . 
All too often , a tragic part of that movie is the failure of the countries ' policymakers to hear the loud cries of canaries in the coal mine . 
Before running up further outsized budget deficits , should we not heed the markets that now see a 10 percent probability that the U.S. government will default on its sovereign debt in the next five years ? 
And should we not be paying close attention to the Chinese central bank governor 's musings that he does not feel comfortable with the $ 1 trillion of U.S. government debt that the Chinese central bank already owns , let alone adding to those holdings ? 
In the twilight of my career , when I am hopefully wiser than before , I have come to regret how the IMF and the U.S. Treasury all too often lectured leaders in emerging markets on how to `` get their house in order '' -- without the slightest thought that the United States might fare no better when facing a major economic crisis . 
Now , I fear time is running out for our own policymakers to mend their ways and offer real leadership to extricate the United States from its worst economic calamity since the 1930s . 
If we insist on improvising and not facing our real problems , we might soon lose our status as a country to be emulated and join the ranks of those nations we have patronized for so long .

"LONDON , March 30 -- At this week 's summit of world leaders , the big winner will be the developing world , with the United States , Europe and Japan offering China , India , Brazil and other emerging nations unprecedented new influence in global financial decisions . 
Several major developing countries -- most notably China -- are also in late-stage negotiations to win new authority to shape decisions at the Washington-based International Monetary Fund , an organization that developing nations have long complained dictate to them rather than hear them out . 
The new role for developing nations signifies a tilt in the world economic order being accelerated by the financial crisis . 
Their leaders blame the collapse of financial institutions on bad management and poor regulations by the West , which , they argue , has robbed rich countries of the moral authority to rebuild financial standards on their own . 
`` This crisis was fostered and boosted by irrational behavior of some people that are white , blue-eyed , '' Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters in Brasilia last week after a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown . 
`` Before the crisis they looked like they knew everything about economics , and they have demonstrated they know nothing about economics . '' 
The one-day London summit is expected to end Thursday with leaders from many of the world 's biggest economies agreeing on new regulations for banks and hedge funds , a large increase in funding for the IMF and a pledge to fight protectionism . 
But early versions of a draft communique the leaders are expected to release indicate that there will be relatively few specifics on those issues . 
They are also expected to tread lightly on U.S. calls -- opposed by many in Europe -- to boost government spending worldwide to combat the global economic crisis . 
U.S. officials indicated last week that they would not press nations to adhere to specific spending targets . 
Instead , analysts said that perhaps the most concrete agreement on Thursday will revolve around the new status bestowed on emerging countries . 
The United States and Britain need the deep pockets of nations such as China and Saudi Arabia now more than ever as they seek buyers for billions of dollars worth of debt to cover the cost of stimulus spending and bank bailouts at home . 
In response , China in particular is exerting more authority . 
Beijing has gone so far as to push for a new global reserve currency besides the U.S. dollar , a proposal that , while dismissed by Washington , will nevertheless get an airing in London this week . 
The IMF , which since its inception at the end of World War II has been largely funded and controlled by rich nations , is also seeking significant new contributions from cash-rich emerging economies as it comes under enormous strain to bail out a growing number of hard-hit and poor countries . 
But the largest developing countries , many of whose economies are growing despite the global downturn , have made it clear that in exchange for the cash , they want a seat at the decision-making table . 
Two weeks ago at a finance ministers meeting ahead of the summit , Brazil , China , Russia and India issued their own communique saying they want more say in global affairs . 
There has also been growing momentum to increase the presence of developing countries on other important bodies such as the United Nations Security Council . 
`` We call for urgent action with regard to voice and representation in the IMF in order that they better reflect their real economic weights , '' the four countries said in the communique . 
The United States this week is proposing that five developing nations -- China , Brazil , Russia , Mexico and India -- be given more influence on IMF lending decisions in return for tens of billions of dollars in new donations , according to an administration official . 
Washington is looking for world leaders to endorse the idea this week , with details to be worked out before the IMF 's annual meeting in Washington next month . 
Some European governments , however , are cautious , fearing they would lose power in an institution traditionally headed by one of their own . 
The global leaders this week are also set to endorse the expansion of the Financial Stability Forum in Switzerland , which will emerge with a new name -- the Financial Stability Board -- and a vastly expanded mission . 
The organization currently brings together regulators , central bankers and finance ministers from a cluster of wealthy nations . 
The new membership will include 10 emerging markets including Argentina , Brazil , South Africa and China . 
The institution , which previously served as a little-used forum for exchanging ideas , will draft the details to enhance global standards for financial institutions , including benchmarks for executive pay and how much risk they can take on . 
Critics , however , charge that the entrance of so many emerging nations into the club at once could complicate the process . 
`` You can understand China ; they are part of the global financial system now and you have to hear them out , '' said Howard Davies , director of the London School of Economics . 
`` But while we may have messed things up royally , that does n't mean we should be taking advice from Argentina . '' ''

In September 2005 , Timothy Geithner made one of his most visible moves as a supervisor of the U.S. banking system . 
He summoned the nation 's top financial firms and their regulators to streamline an antiquated system that threatened Wall Street 's boom . 
Billions of dollars worth of financial instruments known as credit derivatives were being traded daily , as banks and investors worldwide tried to protect against losses on increasingly complex and risky financial bets . 
But the buying and selling of these exotic instruments was stuck in a pencil-and-paper era . 
Geithner , then head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , pressed 14 major financial firms to build an electronic network that would cut backlogs and make the market easier to monitor . 
Geithner 's summit , held at the New York Fed 's fortress-like headquarters near Wall Street , was a success . 
By fall 2006 , the new system had all but eliminated the logjam , helping derivatives trade more efficiently . 
One financial industry newsletter honored Geithner as part of a `` Dream Team '' for his leadership of the effort . 
Yet as Geithner and the New York Fed worked to solve narrow mechanical issues in the derivatives market , they missed clear signs of a catastrophe in the making . 
When the housing market collapsed , derivatives stoked the fires that ignited inside some of the biggest banking companies . 
The firms ' failure to assess an array of risks they were taking has emerged as a key element in the multitrillion-dollar meltdown of the global financial system . 
Although Geithner repeatedly raised concerns about the failure of banks to understand their risks , including those taken through derivatives , he and the Federal Reserve system did not act with enough force to blunt the troubles that ensued . 
That was largely because he and other regulators relied too much on assurances from senior banking executives that their firms were safe and sound , according to interviews and a review of documents by The Washington Post and the nonprofit journalism organization ProPublica . 
A confidential review ordered by Geithner in 2006 found that banking companies could not properly assess their exposure to a severe economic downturn and were relying on the `` intuition '' of banking executives rather than hard quantitative analysis , according to interviews with Fed officials and a little-noticed audit by the Government Accountability Office . 
The Fed did not use key enforcement tools until later , after the credit crisis erupted , according to its records and interviews . 
Geithner defended his tenure as New York Fed president in an interview last week . 
He said he had been `` deeply concerned about risk in the system '' and worked assiduously behind the scenes to cajole banking institutions to do more to identify weaknesses and protect the financial system . 
But he also took some responsibility for falling short . 
`` These efforts to improve risk management did change behavior , but they did not achieve enough traction , '' Geithner said . 
`` We 're having a major financial crisis in part because of failures of supervision . '' 
Even as critics have questioned how he used existing power before the crisis , Geithner , as Treasury secretary , now leads the push for the biggest expansion of financial regulation since the Great Depression . 
His sweeping plan to overhaul the U.S. financial system would empower regulators to broadly analyze risk and would grant more authority to the Fed and its 12 reserve banks . 
Geithner says he is applying lessons from his five years at the most important of the Fed 's reserve banks . 
This week , he assumed an even more prominent platform , joining President Obama in London at a meeting with the Group of 20 industrialized nations to discuss global financial regulatory reform . 
Looking back at his time at the New York Fed , Geithner said : `` I wish I had worked to change the framework , rather than to work within that framework . '' 
Geithner , 47 , adopted the diplomatic approach to supervision that had long held sway at the New York Fed , a hybrid institution that is owned by the banks but implements monetary policy for the Federal Reserve . 
Like the other regional Feds , it also shares supervisory authority with the central bank . 
Six of its nine board members are chosen by the commercial banking companies it supervises . 
The board plays a role in the selection of the New York Fed president .

"Administration Seeks an Out on Bailout Rules for Firms Rep. Edolphus Towns favors enforcing the restrictions on participating firms . 
-LRB- By Chip Somodevilla -- Getty Images -RRB- The Obama administration is engineering its new bailout initiatives in a way that it believes will allow firms benefiting from the programs to avoid restrictions imposed by Congress , including limits on lavish executive pay , according to government officials . 
Administration officials have concluded that this approach is vital for persuading firms to participate in programs funded by the $ 700 billion financial rescue package . 
The administration believes it can sidestep the rules because , in many cases , it has decided not to provide federal aid directly to financial companies , the sources said . 
Instead , the government has set up special entities that act as middlemen , channeling the bailout funds to the firms and , via this two-step process , stripping away the requirement that the restrictions be imposed , according to officials . 
Although some experts are questioning the legality of this strategy , the officials said it gives them latitude to determine whether firms should be subject to the congressional restrictions , which would require recipients to turn over ownership stakes to the government , as well as curb executive pay . 
The administration has decided that the conditions should not apply in at least three of the five initiatives funded by the rescue package . 
This strategy has so far attracted little scrutiny on Capitol Hill , and even some senior congressional aides dealing with the financial crisis said they were unaware of the administration 's efforts . 
Just two weeks ago , Congress erupted in outrage over bonuses being paid at American International Group , with some lawmakers faulting the administration for failing to do more to safeguard taxpayers ' interests . 
Rep. Edolphus Towns -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said the congressional conditions should apply to any firm benefiting from bailout funds . 
He said he planned to review the administration 's decisions and might seek to undo them . 
`` We have to make certain that if they are using government money in any sort of way , there should be restrictions , '' he said . 
A Treasury spokesman defended the approach . 
`` These programs are designed to both comply with the law and ensure taxpayers ' funds are used most effectively to bring about economic recovery , '' spokesman Andrew Williams said . 
In one program , designed to restart small-business lending , President Obama 's officials are planning to set up a middleman called a special-purpose vehicle -- a term made notorious during the Enron scandal -- or another type of entity to evade the congressional mandates , sources familiar with the matter said . 
In another program , which seeks to restart consumer lending , a special entity was created largely for the separate purpose of getting around legal limits on the Federal Reserve , which is helping fund this initiative . 
The Fed does not ordinarily provide support for the markets that finance credit cards , auto loans and student loans but could channel the funds through a middleman . 
At first , when the initiative was being developed last year , the Bush administration decided to apply executive-pay limits to firms participating in this program . 
But Obama officials reversed that decision days before it was unveiled on March 3 and lifted the curbs , according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private . 
Obama 's team is also planning to exempt financial firms that participate in a program designed to find private investors to buy the distressed assets on the books of banks . 
But Treasury officials are still examining the legal basis for doing so . 
Congress has exempted the Treasury from applying the restrictions in a fourth program , which aids lenders who modify mortgages for struggling homeowners . 
"
"A year ago , the International Monetary Fund was in a funk . 
Its handling of past financial crises had made it deeply unpopular . 
Its finances were shaky . 
A fifth of the staff was looking to leave . 
Without new crises to address , doubts about its relevance grew even among insiders . 
As one veteran staffer put it , `` It was a period of introspection . '' 
The second-guessing ended in September as the global economic crisis took hold and countries again turned to the fund for advice and financial support . 
Its comeback became official this week when world leaders meeting in London pledged to quadruple its resources and strengthen its mandate . 
`` The IMF has suffered a slow deterioration in morale , '' said Simon Johnson , a former IMF chief economist . 
`` The Asian crisis was traumatic ... they lost a lot of confidence . '' 
Staff reductions last year added to the humiliation and embarrassment , he said . 
`` Now it 's night and day . '' 
The mood in the hallways `` is one of invigoration , '' said a senior-level IMF official , who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak . 
`` People are pretty busy and they are happy to be helping ... so they feel validated . '' 
The Fund , which has 2,370 employees , most based in Washington , has repositioned itself periodically since its creation after World War II . 
Its initial focus was to oversee the exchange rate system established under the Bretton Woods agreements . 
That role ended in the 1970s . 
In the 1980s , it emerged as the manager of the Latin American debt crisis . 
In the 1990s , it stepped in to deal with the Mexican and East Asian financial crises . 
During this crisis , the IMF regained its stature partly by default . 
In the months leading up to this week 's meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations in London , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown talked of creating new international institutions . 
But in the end , the G-20 chose not to go through the trouble and chose to work with existing organizations . 
Former and current IMF officials say the fund 's leadership also deserves credit for actively seeking a more central role and for making changes that helped overcome some of the potential objections . 
Last month , the IMF revamped its lending practices to make it easier for countries with strong economic policies to borrow more , faster and with fewer strings attached . 
The centerpiece is a new flexible line of credit designed to be used as a preventive measure . 
IMF officials said the fund was trying to respond to long-standing criticism that the organization imposes conditions on developing nations that are too harsh and even harmful to their economies . 
The flexible credit line replaces a credit line created last fall that had no takers because countries said it offered too little money and too rigid terms . 
In a small sign of success , Mexico recently said it would use the new credit line . 
But South Korea and Singapore still refuse to do so .

"Timothy Geithner and his predecessor Henry Paulson have been the public faces of the U.S. government 's battle against the global economic crisis . 
But even as the secretaries of the Treasury have garnered the headlines -- as well as popular anger surrounding bank bailouts and corporate bonuses -- another official has quickly amassed great influence by committing trillions of dollars to keep markets afloat , radically redefining his institution and taking on serious risks as he seeks to rescue the American economy . 
Without a doubt , this crisis is now Ben Bernanke 's war . 
Bernanke has become the country 's economist in chief , the banker for the United States and perhaps the world , and has employed every weapon in the Federal Reserve 's arsenal . 
He has overseen the broadest use of the Fed 's powers since World War II , and the regulation proposals working their way through Congress seem likely to empower the institution even further . 
Although his actions may be justified under today 's circumstances , Bernanke 's willingness to pump money into the economy risks unleashing the most serious bout of U.S. inflation since the early 1980s , in a nation already battered by rising unemployment and negative growth . 
If he succeeds in restarting growth while avoiding high inflation , Bernanke may well become the most revered economist in modern history . 
But for the moment , he is operating in uncharted territory . 
When he first joined the Federal Reserve 's Board of Governors in 2002 , and later when he became chairman in 2006 , there was little reason to expect Bernanke to revolutionize central banking . 
After all , it was the Age of Greenspan the Triumphant . 
Almost two decades of sustained growth and low inflation had created the illusion of central banking as a precise science , with the Fed simply reading economic statistics and nudging short-term interest rates up or down to keep the American economy humming and inflation low . 
Shortly after succeeding Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman , Bernanke credited his predecessor 's monetary policy with helping to reduce wide swings in U.S. economic performance -- the so-called `` Great Moderation '' -- and revive the productivity of American workers . 
This apparent success also lent staying power to some of Greenspan 's conviction that the Fed should regulate the banking system with a light touch , relying on the free market and private-sector incentives . 
Bernanke initially maintained Greenspan 's hands-off approach to the emerging housing bubble . 
As the financial crisis deepened in late 2007 and early 2008 , however , the Fed began expanding its lending efforts to financial institutions that could n't raise money in private markets . 
This was Bernanke 's first departure from the Greenspan school , in which tweaking interest rates was the instrument that mattered . 
Then , in 2008 , Bernanke became sucked into the firestorms that threatened to engulf the financial sector : Bear Stearns , AIG , the money markets and Citigroup , among others . 
In these interventions , the Fed brought the money . 
It extended loans to newly created entities and accepted dodgy collateral in return ; lent money directly to non-financial institutions ; or guaranteed the value of toxic assets -- a series of reactive , chaotic and non-transparent transactions that seem to have enriched Wall Street and have attracted congressional concern . 
The theory at the time was that the financial sector was facing a liquidity crisis , with banks unable to raise enough money to pay off their short-term debts . 
In response , the Fed would provide enough cash for banks to `` deleverage in a more orderly manner , '' as Bernanke explained last August . 
By late 2008 , the Fed was providing $ 1.5 trillion of liquidity to the economy through these programs -- an amount roughly equal to half of the 2008 federal budget -- prompting John Cassidy of the New Yorker , in a perceptive essay , to note that Bernanke had begun to `` intervene on Wall Street in ways never before contemplated by the Fed . '' 
Since late last year , however , Bernanke has signaled that even these efforts are not enough . 
In a January speech , Bernanke acknowledged the limits of liquidity and outlined a broader strategy in which the Fed would do everything in its power to increase credit . 
And last month , in an extraordinary interview on `` 60 Minutes , '' Bernanke conveyed a powerful message with his words about the Fed `` printing money '' and with his body language , as he toured his home town in South Carolina and declared that he cares about Wall Street only because it affects Main Street -- in part attempting to defuse criticism that the Fed lending was mainly benefiting bankers . 
Clearly , the Fed chairman recognizes the severity of the problem and has decided to do whatever it takes to prevent anything like the Great Depression from happening again . 
Given where we are today , that means printing money , even if that runs the risk of creating a serious inflation problem . 
Shortly after joining the Fed in 2002 , Bernanke gave a speech describing how the Fed could prevent deflation , i.e. , a general decline in prices . 
The key theme was that , in a pinch , the Fed could simply print more dollars -- for example , by buying long-term bonds on the market -- which reduces the value of each dollar in circulation and therefore raises the dollar price of goods and services . 
`` Under a paper-money system , '' Bernanke explained , `` a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation . '' 
In a time of economic overconfidence , the discussion seemed largely academic . 
But it is now clear that Bernanke intends to follow through on it . 
After the double-digit inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s , why would anyone want to create inflation ? 
Households and companies alike are trying to `` deleverage , '' or pay down their debts . 
But deflation makes it harder to pay down debts , because debts are fixed in dollars and those dollars are becoming worth more and more . 
Moderate inflation in the neighborhood of 4 percent , by contrast , makes it easier for borrowers to manage their debt loads , and stimulates the economy . 
"
"President Obama recently stated that he is a big believer in '' persistence , '' and he provided examples of how he will persist in many areas of economic policy . 
That word and his examples gave me more hope for the future of the U.S. economy than I have had in some time . 
We are experiencing the mother of all modern financial crises . 
Real and imaginary counterparty risk , policy uncertainty , and widespread panic have reduced purely private financial transactions to a trickle in many vital markets . 
Unfortunately , an already complex economic problem is being compounded by an awful political environment , and the prefrontal cortex of our political system is freezing up as well . 
Politicians and commentators from the left and right are in panic mode and have retrenched to their basic instincts , moving away from reasoned analysis . 
It is , frankly , scary to hear the right regurgitating the untimely liquidationist claims that Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon made during the onset of the Great Depression . 
It is also frightening to see the left going after Wall Street `` oligarchs '' and the financial institutions they have always hated , which finally are easy prey . 
Fortunately , some voices of reason remain , and the Treasury , Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are among them . 
They have been persistent . 
It is true that the announcement made in early February by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner lacked specifics , but it was not short on principles and general guidelines . 
These principles recognized the systemic nature of today 's crisis and the critical role that uncertainty has played in it . 
The announcement of the `` legacy assets '' program last month confirmed these principles . 
From this , one can get a sense of perseverance and determination , which are exactly what an economy needs during times of massive uncertainty . 
The basis of the U.S. financial system and economy is private capital . 
Policies must encourage rather than discourage private capital participation for the short run as well as the long run . 
One of the main problems behind the crisis is excessive leverage , which means too much debt relative to equity . 
We need more , not less , equity and more , not fewer , shareholders . 
Because it is the government 's responsibility to ensure a well-functioning financial system during episodes of panic , it is not anti-capitalist for the government to support private capital during these episodes , just as it is not anti-capitalist to charge for this service in advance and to regulate financial institutions of systemic importance . 
The U.S. financial system is worth preserving , and the only safe policy while investors are in panic mode is to preserve it with as few changes as possible , with the government providing the resources needed to get to a point where we can fix the structural problems that contributed to the crisis . 
Contrary to popular perception , providing this support has nothing to do with the `` zombie '' policies of the Japanese experience during the 1990s . 
There , the problem was that banks kept making loans to unproductive companies to avoid having to recognize the losses associated with old loans to those companies . 
As a result , good companies had less access to loans than they would have otherwise . 
But a policy of supporting the sale of troubled assets through public guarantees , loans and equity participation , complemented with a public-private program to strengthen the capital of systemically important financial institutions , is the opposite of the zombie strategy . 
Such a framework builds a solid foundation for new lending and does not create incentives for banks to lend to the wrong clients . 
If the administration 's economic team can keep a steady course , and if it is persistent , we have a good chance of getting out of this mess in the near future .

-LRB- By Rebecca Blackwell -- Associated Press -RRB- For more than a decade , much of Africa has been moving forward . 
Economic growth is rising , poverty is falling and democratic governance is spreading . 
But the global financial crisis threatens to undo this progress by reducing investment , exports and aid just as they should be expanding to build on these successes . 
While international attention has been understandably focused on events in Darfur , Somalia and Zimbabwe , countries across the continent including Ghana , Tanzania , Mozambique and Liberia have been quietly turning around . 
Economic growth rates regularly exceed 5 percent in many nations . 
Since 2000 , 34 million more African children are in school . 
More than 2 million Africans are on lifesaving HIV\/AIDS medicines . 
Malaria deaths have been halved in Rwanda and Ethiopia , and the disease has been virtually eradicated in Zanzibar . 
Poverty rates are falling fast , from 58 to 51 percent across the continent in just six years , according to the World Bank . 
The key to this progress is stronger African leadership and more accountable governance . 
Today , more than 20 African countries are democracies , up from just three in the 1980s ; they have competitive elections and improved human rights , and their news media are much freer . 
These efforts have been supported by increasingly effective development assistance from the United States and other partners . 
Consider what has happened in my country , Liberia . 
After 14 years of devastating war , we faced enormous challenges but had precious few resources . 
Our democratically elected government has worked with international partners and a growing number of private investors to turn things around . 
In the past three years , we have doubled primary school enrollment nationwide , refurbished hundreds of health facilities , and begun rebuilding roads and generators . 
We have taken steps to root out corruption and remove unscrupulous officials . 
Growth has exceeded 8 percent per year . 
And , most critical , we are at peace . 
We are restoring our once-vibrant nation , and the crucial component -- hope -- has already been revived . 
Without international support , we would not have made this progress and would be at much greater risk of returning to war . 
The economic crisis threatens the progress in my country and elsewhere on our continent . 
An estimated $ 50 billion in income could be lost in Africa during the next two years . 
Declining remittances , trade flows and investment could undermine new businesses , throw millions out of work , and increase tensions and instability . 
The crisis -- which Africa did nothing to cause -- demands a strong response . 
African nations must do their part by continuing to address corruption , eliminate red tape and reduce obstacles to private-sector growth . 
But just as industrialized countries need a stimulus , African economies need a boost to keep their progress on track . 
The Group of 20 meeting last week produced a helpful first step . 
Going forward , five additional steps are critical . 
First , the G-20 pledge to provide the International Monetary Fund with new resources must be fulfilled , and the IMF needs to get those resources to countries quickly and without onerous conditions . 
Second , the World Bank and the African Development Bank must better leverage their resources ; aggressively front-load support ; and better target growth , jobs and safety-net programs . 
The International Finance Corp. , the World Bank 's private-sector affiliate , must be especially creative in keeping private investment on track . 
Third , bilateral partners must build on their promises to increase aid and make it more effective by reducing bureaucratic delays , speeding disbursements and better aligning programs with African priorities . 
Fourth , export credit agencies must use their resources to attack risk and other barriers to trade finance , such as liquidity issues . 
Fifth , all countries must resist protectionist pressures so that trade can be the critical engine for restoring global growth . 
The citizens and leaders of donor nations should recognize how important their assistance has been to the new leadership in Africa and how appreciative most Africans are for this partnership . 
Critics say that African economies are shrinking , that poverty is rising and that failing aid is the culprit . 
But this argument is at least a decade out of date . 
Africa 's turnaround is real , the evidence indisputable . 
Africans themselves have been the key to this reversal , but more effective aid has played an important role . 
Reducing aid would slow private-sector growth , stall poverty reduction , and undermine peace and stability in countries that are struggling to become part of the global economy . 
It would be a cruel irony if , just as Africa began to succeed , its prospects were cut short by a crisis beyond its control . 
Strong action by African governments and robust support from the international community can keep Africa 's recovery on track . 
Both should continue to do their part .

"A New Set of Smart Investing Rules for the Post-Crisis Era Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . 
Many investors have become uncomfortably familiar with their risk tolerance . 
-LRB- By Jin Lee -- Bloomberg News -RRB- Do the old rules of investing still apply ? 
`` Buy and hold '' has proved a good method for cutting your wealth in half . 
Regularly rebalancing a portfolio has sent money straight to sectors , such as financial-company stocks , that plunged steeply . 
And , though it 's said that no one can successfully time the market , those who cashed out early now look like sages . 
While it 's anybody 's guess when the post-crisis era will begin , financial planners offer some investing principles that reflect some of the lessons investors have learned the hard way . 
Pat Meadows , a recent retiree who lives in Haymarket , said she and her friends in a small investment club have been changed . 
`` We 're not as trusting as we were , '' she said . 
Her club account represents only about 5 percent of her investments , the bulk of her retirement money is in a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- . 
The club stayed with stocks far longer than she did with her retirement money . 
In October 2007 , to prepare for retirement , she moved some money out of stock investments and into less-volatile instruments such bonds , bond mutual funds and certificates of deposit . 
`` That kind of saved me a little , '' she said . 
Going forward , she said she will trust her instincts more , and ask more questions before investing . 
Among the post-crisis principles that advisers say should guide your investing are the following : The stock market 's plunge may have revealed that your risk tolerance is not as high as you thought . 
Age is not the only thing that should determine your tolerance for the risk of losses . 
The label `` market timer '' should not deter you from keeping extra cash on the sidelines when the market is hostile . 
And the worthy technique of dollar-cost averaging does n't translate well when you have a lump sum to invest . 
People do n't really understand their own feelings about risk , said Vern C. Hayden , a certified financial planner in Westport , Conn. `` When the market is going up 30 percent , they say they can lose 10 or 20 percent with no problem . 
All of a sudden the market goes down , and now it 's ' I do n't want to lose 10 or 15 percent . ' ''

"A previous version of this edited transcript omitted part of John Williamson 's answer to the question of whether he voted for British Prime Minister Gordon Brown . 
His full answer was `` No , I 've not voted for him . 
I 've always voted for the other party -- the Liberal Democrats . '' 
A Conversation With John Williamson , Economist Poor countries have decried it . 
Anti-globalization protesters have rallied against it . 
And at the G20 summit in London , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown declared it dead . 
But is the `` Washington Consensus '' really gone ? 
Not if you ask John Williamson , the soft-spoken British economist who coined the term 20 years ago -- and has been under fire ever since . 
How did a wonky paper outlining 10 recommendations on fiscal discipline and open markets become such a lightning rod ? 
Williamson , a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics , spoke last week with Outlook 's Carlos Lozada about what caused the financial crisis and how , whatever Brown says , the Washington Consensus is alive and well -- just check out the G20 communique . 
Excerpts : Where were you when Gordon Brown declared that your `` old Washington Consensus is over '' ? 
Did you watch it on TV ? 
I was in the Galapagos . 
I did not watch it on TV ; I did have Internet access in the Galapagos so I was able to read about it . 
People have been saying the Washington Consensus is dead for about twenty years now , ever since it was first created . 
My reaction was more amusement than anger , but it was a combination of the two . 
It depends on what one means by the Washington Consensus . 
If one means the ten points that I tried to outline , then clearly it 's not right . 
If one uses the interpretation that a number of people -- including Joe Stiglitz , most prominently -- have foisted on it , that it is a neoliberal tract , then I think it is right . 
How would you summarize it ? 
-LRB- It -RRB- involved macroeconomic discipline , including fiscal discipline , which was a particular problem in Latin America . 
And then it involved using the market economy , not setting it up on a totem pole as some ideal that must never be interfered with , but recognizing that there were serious limitations on the market economy . 
And third was globalization , free trade , absorbing oneself into the global economy . 
Is the Washington Consensus in any way to blame for the global financial crisis ? 
I think that would be pushing it . 
If you read the communique following the London summit , you 'll find that three of the things they agreed on were very much the things I have used to summarize the Washington Consensus . 
It starts off with globalization , it also mentions the market economy . 
Fiscal discipline comes later ; it 's in paragraphs 10 and 11 rather than right at the beginning , because that 's not the immediate problem . 
If the Washington Consensus is n't to blame , what is ?

"American minorities need to `` strengthen their financial literacy , '' Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told students and faculty at Atlanta 's historically black Morehouse College yesterday . 
On a day when President Obama delivered an Economic Crisis 101 lecture to students and faculty at Georgetown University , Bernanke was doing the same at the all-male school in Georgia . 
Bernanke was asked about the wealth gap between American whites and blacks during an expansive question-and-answer session following his speech . 
Some of the questioners said they had postgraduate jobs lined up as investment bankers , others in finance at large corporations . 
`` It 's absolutely right the difference between minority and white wealth is very significant , and part of that is related to income levels where whites have a higher average income , '' Bernanke said . 
`` But even if you control for income level , you find minorities have gathered less wealth . '' 
Part of the cause , he said , is a lack of `` financial education . '' 
`` There needs to be a broader understanding in minority communities , which have n't had that much exposure , about saving and building a credit record and being part of the mainstream economy , '' Bernanke said . 
Too many minorities do n't have bank accounts , he said , and `` borrow from payday lenders and cash checks at check-cashing services , '' which charge for their services . 
`` They would be better off in the mainstream banking system , '' Bernanke said . 
`` So one thing that could help would be to try to strengthen the financial literacy and financial education '' of U.S. minorities . 
Bernanke said Morehouse President Robert Franklin told him that the recession has forced some students to drop out of school , a situation Bernanke called `` an absolute tragedy . ''

"President Obama plans to take his message of partnership to Latin America and the Caribbean this week , but he will face a group of leaders far less forgiving than their European counterparts were about the United States ' central role in the global financial crisis . 
Over the past five years , the region has posted the fastest economic growth rates in the world , lifting millions of Latin Americans out of poverty . 
Now , those gains are threatened by a downturn that , as Inter-American Development Bank President Luis Alberto Moreno said , `` is the hemisphere 's first economic crisis not made in Latin America . '' 
At the fifth Summit of the Americas , hosted by Trinidad and Tobago , Obama will encounter several Latin American leaders who have long criticized the economic mix of free trade , privatization and public-debt reduction known as `` the Washington consensus . '' 
Although Obama will signal the same change in tone and approach from the Bush administration that he delivered to Europe , his audience will be different in its politics and personality . 
Among the leaders he will meet for the first time is Venezuela 's Hugo Ch vez , who used the week before the summit to visit China , Iran and Cuba , in part to celebrate what he said was the end of American financial hegemony . 
Nicaragua 's president , Daniel Ortega , the Sandinista leader who battled the U.S.-sponsored contra insurgency through the 1980s , will be there . 
So will Evo Morales of Bolivia , the only president to have expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from his country . 
While the summit 's final declaration has been negotiated for nearly a year , the hemisphere 's 34 democratically elected leaders will meet in an open forum to discuss the document , some of which was drafted before the financial crash last fall . 
Many of the region 's economies are reliant on exports , now slumping , while some of the poorest countries have seen a sharp decline in remittances from the United States that provide their economic lifeblood . 
`` You have to be willing to accept that Latin Americans , who are experts in crisis after creating many of their own , will say ` We did n't create this one , ' '' Jos Miguel Insulza , secretary general of the Organization of American States , said at a recent forum sponsored by the Inter-American Dialogue and the Canadian Foundation for the Americas . 
`` These are presidents , heads of state ... But we 're going to have some hard things to say . '' 
The summit , characterized by sharp dissension in the past , will also offer preview of a contentious political year in Latin America . 
Four countries will hold presidential elections in the next eight months amid rising poverty caused by what many in the region see as U.S. economic irresponsibility after decades when that criticism flowed from north to south . 
`` The temptation to run against Washington will be very powerful , '' Moreno said . 
In Latin America , Obama has a more bitter history to overcome than in Europe . 
Past U.S. administrations have intervened to oppose insurgencies and unfriendly governments , supported unpopular dictatorships and at other times largely ignored the region . 
The Obama administration has also inherited policies on trade and toward Cuba that are viewed by many in the region as hypocritical . 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a shift in the U.S. approach to Mexico in a visit last month by acknowledging that American drug consumers and guns help drive the narcotics trafficking threatening the Mexican state . 
Obama has met in Washington with Mexico 's President Felipe Calder n and Brazil 's Luiz In cio Lula da Silva . 
`` He is not going to Trinidad with a plan for the hemisphere , '' said Jeffrey Davidow , a former ambassador to Mexico and Obama 's special adviser for the summit . 
`` He is going to Trinidad with the intention of listening , discussing and dealing with his colleagues as partners . '' 
The last summit , held four years ago in Argentina , was dominated by the Bush administration 's push for a hemisphere-wide free-trade agreement . 
The meeting ended without political agreement on trade , highlighting divisions between the United States and Latin America and among the region 's leaders themselves . 
The Obama administration plans to move ahead with a free-trade agreement with Panama and has based its support for a deal with Colombia on President lvaro Uribe 's ability to better protect labor officials . 
`` Trade will be a low priority , both because of the legitimate focus on the financial crisis and because of the Democratic Party 's position on trade , '' said Grant Aldonas , a Center for Strategic and International Studies senior adviser who served as the Commerce Department 's undersecretary for international trade in the Bush administration . 
The agenda for the summit will include environmental preservation and alternative-energy policy , reviving the dismal economy , reversing the deteriorating public safety situation in several countries and closing a regional gap between rich and poor . 
Ricardo Lagos , a former president of Chile , said that `` on many items on the global agenda , we will agree . '' 
`` But , '' he added , `` we must define the boundaries of our disagreement . '' 
Lagos said Cuba policy could be one of those issues . 
On Monday , Obama eased restrictions on the ability of Cuban Americans to visit or send money to family members on the island and opened the door for American telecommunications companies to expand satellite and cellphone service there . 
But Obama has said that he does not intend to lift the 47-year-old trade embargo until the Castro brothers make democratic reforms and improve the government 's human rights record . 
Many Latin Americans think the Obama administration is perpetuating a foreign policy double standard by leaving the embargo in place , given that it is reaching out to Iran and engaging North Korea . 
Some of the border-spanning issues , namely the economy , will expose the ideological differences within Latin America 's left , split now between European-style social democrats and state-oriented socialists . 
One wing is represented by Lula , who has made ethanol fuel development and preservation of the Amazon national priorities . 
He accused `` white , blue-eyed bankers '' of causing the global economic crisis , but he also endorsed the Group of 20 major nations ' more than $ 1 trillion effort to increase funding for the International Monetary Fund , extend trade credits and protect the poorest nations from the downturn . 
He has asked the U.S. administration to lift the import tariff on Brazilian ethanol to help him grow his biofuel industry . 
The other is represented by Ch vez , a strident socialist who for years has attacked U.S. economic policies as `` savage neoliberalism . '' 
Ch vez 's national oil wealth has shrunk significantly with the global decline in demand , and he has had to cut back social programs at the heart of his `` revolution . '' 
During a visit to China last week following a stop in Iran , Ch vez , who expelled the U.S. ambassador in Caracas last year , said `` no one can be ignorant that the center of gravity of the world has moved to Beijing . '' 
He went on to declare that `` the power of the U.S. empire has collapsed . '' '' 
"
"General Growth Properties , the giant shopping mall company whose holdings stretch from Tysons Corner to the planned community of Columbia and Baltimore 's Inner Harbor , yesterday sought protection in bankruptcy court , citing debts of more than $ 27 billion . 
The bankruptcy heralds a wave of trouble in commercial real estate that threatens to put another damper on the economy , industry analysts said . 
By the end of 2011 , $ 1.2 trillion of commercial real estate debt will come due , and like General Growth , many of the borrowers will be unable to refinance or repay their loans , said Gregory H. Leisch , chief executive of Delta Associates , which tracks the industry . 
That would spell more losses for banks and institutional investors such as life insurance companies that are already coping with the meltdown in residential real estate . 
The bankruptcy adds a new element of uncertainty to the future development of Columbia , where General Growth has been working on a long-term plan that county officials have been counting on to revitalize the downtown . 
The economic crisis already assured a delay for the first major effort to remake the 1960-era planned community in decades . 
But for people visiting General Growth 's malls , the Chapter 11 reorganization could be imperceptible . 
`` We 're convinced that we 're going to make this bankruptcy filing invisible to the shoppers in our malls , '' company president Thomas J. Nolan Jr. told reporters . 
`` We 're open for business today , and we 're going to be open for business tomorrow . '' 
General Growth , the nation 's second-largest shopping mall owner , had struggled for months to win reprieves on billions of dollars of debt , much of which was past due . 
The company tried to sell some properties to raise money , but the same lack of credit that prevented it from replacing its loans kept prospective buyers from raising money . 
`` What it tells you is that if they do n't get the financial system restarted , then every real estate company is going to go bankrupt , '' said William Ackman , principal of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management , which holds a major stake in General Growth . 
Other observers said General Growth left itself exceptionally vulnerable to the recession and credit crunch because it had mortgaged itself so heavily . 
`` They 're the poster child for too much debt , and they have been for five years , '' said analyst Richard Moore of RBC Capital Markets . 
The company , based in Chicago , owns or manages more than 200 malls in 44 states . 
Its interests include Harborplace and the Gallery in Baltimore , Boston 's Faneuil Hall Marketplace , New York 's South Street Seaport , the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas , Alexandria 's Landmark Mall as well as Laurel Commons and Tysons Galleria . 
General Growth 's problems can be traced partly to its debt-financed purchase in 2004 of Rouse , the pioneering developer of Columbia and of festival markets such as Harborplace .

"I vote to banish Larry Summers . 
Not from the planet . 
That would n't be nice . 
Just from public life . 
The criticisms of President Obama 's chief economic adviser are well known . 
He 's too close to Wall Street . 
And he 's a frightful bully , of both people and countries . 
Still , we 're told we should n't care about such minor infractions . 
Because Summers is brilliant , and the world needs his big brain . 
And this brings us to a central and often overlooked cause of the global financial crisis : Brain Bubbles . 
This is the process wherein the intelligence of an inarguably intelligent person is inflated and valued beyond all reason , creating a dangerous accumulation of unhedged risk . 
Larry Summers is the biggest Brain Bubble we 've got . 
Brain Bubbles start with an innocuous `` whiz kid '' moniker in undergrad , which later escalates to `` wunderkind . '' 
Next comes the requisite foray as an economic adviser to a small crisis-wracked country , where the kid is declared a `` savior . '' 
By 30 , our Bubble Boy is tenured and officially a `` genius . '' 
By 40 , he 's a `` guru , '' by 50 an `` oracle . '' 
After a few drinks : `` messiah . '' 
The superhuman powers bestowed upon these men -- and yes , they are all men -- shield them from the scrutiny that might have prevented the current crisis . 
Alan Greenspan 's Brain Bubble allowed him to put the economy at great risk : When he made no sense , people assumed that it was their own fault . 
Brain Bubbles also formed the key argument Greenspan and Summers used to explain why lawmakers could n't regulate the derivatives market : The wizards on Wall Street were too brilliant , their models too complex , for mere mortals to understand . 
Back in 1991 , Summers argued that the subject of economics was no longer up for debate : The answers had all been found by men like him . 
`` The laws of economics are like the laws of engineering , '' he said . 
`` One set of laws works everywhere . '' 
Summers subsequently laid out those laws as the three '' - ations '' : privatization , stabilization and liberalization . 
Some `` kinds of ideas , '' he explained a few years later in a PBS interview , have already become too `` pass '' for discussion . 
Like `` the idea that a huge spending program is the way to stimulate the economy . '' 
And that 's the problem with Larry . 
For all his appeals to absolute truths , he has been spectacularly wrong again and again . 
He was wrong about not regulating derivatives . 
Wrong when he helped kill Depression-era banking laws , turning banks into too-big-to-fail welfare monsters . 
And as he helps devise ever more complex tricks and spends ever more taxpayer dollars to keep the financial casino running , he remains wrong today . 
Word is that Summers 's current post may be a pit stop on the way to the big prize , Federal Reserve chairman . 
That means he could actually make `` maestro . '' 
Mr. President , please : Pop this bubble before it 's too late .

"The Great Depression of the 1930s was the most momentous economic event of the 20th century . 
It was a proximate cause of World War II , having fed the Nazis ' rise in Germany . 
It inspired a new American welfare system as a response to mass misery . 
Everywhere , it discredited unsupervised capitalism . 
Given today 's economic crisis , our renewed fascination with the Depression is natural . 
But we ought not stretch the parallels too far . 
The Depression was exceptional in its economic ferocity . 
As Liaquat Ahamed writes in his book '' Lords of Finance '' : `` During a three-year period , real GDP -LRB- gross domestic product -RRB- in the major economies fell by over 25 percent , a quarter of the adult male population was thrown out of work ... The economic turmoil created hardships in every corner of the globe , from the prairies of Canada to the teeming cities of Asia . '' 
Anyone who wants to know why should read this engrossing book . 
Ahamed , a professional money manager , attributes the Depression to two central causes : the misguided restoration of the gold standard in the 1920s and the massive inter-governmental debts , including German reparations , resulting from World War I. His story builds on the scholarship of economists Milton Friedman , Anna Schwartz , Charles Kindleberger , Barry Eichengreen and Peter Temin . 
But Ahamed excels in evoking the political and personal forces that led to disaster . 
His title refers to four men deeply implicated in the era 's perverse policies : Montagu Norman , governor of the Bank of England ; Benjamin Strong , head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank ; mile Moreau , head of the Banque de France ; and Hjalmar Schacht , head of Germany 's Reichsbank . 
Their determination to reinstate the gold standard -- seen as necessary for global prosperity -- brought ruin . 
Under the gold standard , paper money was backed by gold reserves . 
If gold flowed into a country -LRB- normally from a trade surplus or a foreign loan -RRB- , its money and credit supply were supposed to expand . 
If gold flowed out , money and credit were supposed to contract . 
During World War I , Europe 's governments suspended the gold standard . 
They financed the war with paper money and loans from America . 
The appeal of restoring the gold standard was that it would instill confidence by making paper money trustworthy . 
Unfortunately , the war damaged the system beyond repair . 
Britain , the key country , was left with only 7.5 percent of the world 's gold reserves in 1925 . 
Together , the United States and France held more than half the world 's gold . 
The war had expanded U.S. reserves , and when France returned to gold , it did so with an undervalued exchange rate that boosted exports and gold reserves . 
Meanwhile , German reparations to Britain and France were massive , while those countries owed huge amounts to the United States . 
The global financial system was so debt-laden that it `` cracked at the first pressure , '' writes Ahamed . 
That came after a rise in American interest rates in 1928 forced other countries to follow -LRB- no one wanted to lose gold by having investors shift funds elsewhere -RRB- and ultimately led to the 1929 stock market crash . 
As economies weakened , debts went into default . 
Credit and industrial production declined . 
Weakness fed on weakness . 
Sadly , this tragedy has modern parallels . 
Like the 1930s , a worldwide credit collapse is a danger . 
Global stock , bond and bank markets are interwoven . 
Losses in one may prompt pullbacks in others . 
Money flowing to 28 `` emerging market '' countries in 2009 will drop 80 percent from 2007 levels , projects the Institute of International Finance . 
Currency misalignments have , as in the 1920s , distorted trade . 
China 's renminbi is clearly undervalued . 
Still , striking differences separate now from then . 
The biggest is that governments -- unencumbered by the gold standard -- have eased credit , propped up financial institutions and increased spending to arrest an economic free fall . 
The Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund have made loans available to emerging-market countries to offset the loss of private credit . 
Nor is there anything like the international rancor that followed World War I and impeded cooperation : In 1931 , the French balked at rescuing Austria 's biggest bank -LRB- Creditanstalt -RRB- , whose failure triggered a chain reaction of European panics . 
When countries left the gold standard -- the United States effectively did so in 1933 -- their economies began to recover . 
Some indicators now imply that the present decline is ebbing -LRB- '' glimmers of hope , '' says President Obama -RRB- . 
China shows similar signs of improvement . 
All this diminishes the dreary comparisons with the Depression . 
But if these omens prove false , a more somber conclusion could emerge . 
The mistakes of the Depression were rooted in prevailing economic orthodoxies , which had been overtaken by new realities . 
The present policies likewise reflect today 's orthodoxies . 
But what if they , too , turn out to be misguided because the world has moved on in ways that become obvious mostly in retrospect ?

"The scene this morning outside David Kellermann 's house . 
-LRB- Gerald Martineau - The Washington Post -RRB- David Kellermann poses in an undated handout photo . 
Kellermann joined Freddie Mac as an analyst in 1992 . 
-LRB- Bloomberg News -RRB- A Fairfax County investigator packs equipment into a van outside the home of David Kellermann . 
-LRB- Gerald Martineau - The Washington Post -RRB- Fairfax County police personnel escort an unidentified woman into the Kellermann home . 
-LRB- Gerald Martineau - The Washington Post -RRB- Alesia Humphries , a neighbor of the Kellermanns , reacts to news of his death . 
-LRB- Gerald Martineau - The Washington Post -RRB- In the months before he died , David B. Kellermann would trek most evenings to Freddie Mac 's executive suite to see his boss . 
Long after other employees had headed home from the McLean campus , Kellermann , the acting chief financial officer , would remain cloistered with chief executive David Moffett , wrestling for hours with the difficulties of a company that had been near collapse . 
Kellermann usually brought a three-page list of to-do items . 
Moffett was new to the company , appointed by the government after it seized Freddie Mac in September , and he recalled leaning heavily on Kellermann 's 16 years of experience at the firm for guidance . 
Kellermann , 41 , was found dead yesterday morning in his Fairfax County home in an apparent suicide , police said . 
He left no note , law enforcement sources said , and his motivations were not known . 
But even if his final act was unrelated to work , his last months were consumed by the mounting stresses at the center of the financial crisis . 
People who knew him said he was deeply committed to Freddie Mac , just about the only place he 'd worked professionally , and its struggles had taken an increasingly visible toll . 
`` David was engaged in all parts of the company , '' said Moffett , who tapped Kellermann as his chief financial officer before resigning the top post last month . 
`` The CFO of any company in today 's environment is a very stressful job ... particularly when you 're in a company that 's undergoing a tremendous amount of change and uncertainty . '' 
Kellermann had worked his way up at Freddie Mac from a young financial analyst to one of the mortgage giant 's main points of contact with its government overseers . 
Recently , he 'd faced intense pressures dealing with the company 's billions of dollars in losses and myriad other accounting and legal issues , refusing to take time off , his colleagues said . 
`` He endured a tremendous amount of stress over the years ... It 's been a difficult environment , '' said Peter Federico , Freddie Mac 's treasurer and a close friend . 
The news of Kellermann 's death yesterday stunned his colleagues . 
`` It 's one of the things that puts everything in perspective . 
It 's difficult for everybody to deal with it , '' Federico said . 
Kellermann was found by his wife , Donna , yesterday in the basement of their home in the upscale Hunter Mill Estates subdivision in Vienna , law enforcement sources said . 
He had hanged himself on a piece of exercise equipment , the sources said . 
There were no signs of foul play . 
His body was taken to the office of the medical examiner , who will rule on the cause of death . 
Soon after Kellermann 's death was reported , television trucks pulled up outside his stately brick home and its manicured lawn , beaming the image around the world . 
Many neighbors were taken aback by the attention given to the apparent suicide . 
Susan Unger , a neighbor , said she last saw him a few weeks ago working in his yard . 
She woke up early yesterday morning to the sound of rescue crews arriving . 
`` They took the stretcher in and brought it out empty , so I thought everything was okay , '' Unger said . 
`` It 's just so sad ... I 'm just in total shock . '' 
The neighbors knew Kellermann mostly as a doting father of a young daughter and meticulous gardener . 
He decorated his home lavishly for Christmas and threw great parties for Halloween and University of Michigan football games . 
He 'd attended Michigan before receiving a graduate degree from George Washington University . 
But Sergio Moreno , who lives up the street , said he had recently noticed some changes . 
Kellermann was busier than ever and more stressed . 
A large man , Kellermann had lost a lot of weight .

"BEIJING -- With Jamaica 's currency in free fall , unemployment soaring and banks heavily exposed to government debt , the Caribbean island 's diplomats went into crisis mode earlier this year . 
They traveled to all corners of the world to seek help . 
Jamaica 's traditional allies , the United States and Britain , were preoccupied with their own financial problems , but a new friend jumped at the opportunity to come to the rescue : China . 
When contracts for loan packages totaling $ 138 million were signed between the two countries in March , China became Jamaica 's biggest financial partner . 
Headlines in Jamaica 's leading newspapers , which only a year ago were filled with concern about China 's growing influence in the region , gushed about its generosity . 
`` The loan could n't have come more in time and on more preferred terms , '' E. Courtenay Rattray , Jamaica 's ambassador to China , said in an interview . 
While the island nation continues to value its close relationships with Western powers , he added , in some respects Jamaica has more in common with China . 
`` Those are developed countries . 
They do n't have such an in-depth understanding of the development aspirations of Jamaica as does China , '' he said . 
Overseas aid and loans are just one way China is asserting itself in its new role as a world financial leader . 
While polishing China 's own image , Premier Wen Jiabao and other top leaders have blamed the West for the global economic crisis . 
Chinese officials increasingly are challenging the primacy of the dollar , warning other countries about the danger of keeping reserves in just one or two currencies , such as dollars and euros . 
And as the global economic crisis has eroded faith in U.S.-style capitalism , there 's growing talk that a new `` Beijing Consensus '' will replace the long-dominant Washington Consensus on how developing countries should manage their economies . 
Coined by British economist John Williamson 20 years ago , the term `` Washington Consensus '' refers to a standard set of policies -- including privatization of state enterprises , free trade , deregulation and restraint in public spending -- that the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the U.S. Treasury Department have long urged on debt-ridden nations , particularly in Latin America . 
A fierce debate has broken out among academics and financial policymakers about how to define the Beijing Consensus , or even whether such a thing exists ; many say that it is a loose package of political points rather than an economic model , and that there is no formal effort by the Chinese government to promote it . 
But some experts are already calling it a challenge to the existing order . 
`` It is very possible that the Beijing Consensus can replace the Washington Consensus , '' said Cui Zhiyuan , a professor of public policy at Tsinghua University who edited a recent book on the subject . 
`` Since the crisis , the world does n't have as much confidence in the U.S. economic model as before . '' 
In a report last month titled `` The Beijing Consensus , '' South Korea 's Ministry of Strategy and Finance sounded an alarm over China 's aid and loans . 
Developing countries that accept Chinese assistance , it warned , may lower their guard and gravitate toward a Chinese-style economic model . 
Jamaica 's Rattray dismissed those fears as overblown . 
China 's financial assistance to his country came with `` no requirement to adopt specific macroeconomic policy approaches , '' he said , and there is `` no debate about the government of Jamaica 's commitment to a free-market economic model . '' 
Cheng Enfu , an economics researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , a government-affiliated think tank , said he defines the Beijing Consensus as promotion of economies in which public ownership remains dominant ; gradual reform is preferred to `` shock therapy '' ; the country is open to foreign trade but remains largely self-reliant ; and large-scale market reform takes place first , followed later by political and cultural change . 
The global economic crisis , Cheng said , `` displays the advantages of the Chinese model '' and has already expanded China 's influence . 
`` Some mainstream economists are saying that India should learn from China ; Latin American countries are trying to learn from China . 
When foreign countries send delegations to China , they show interest in the Chinese way of developing , '' Cheng said . 
Barry Sautman , a political scientist at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , said in a research paper that Western academics often deride the Chinese model as `` economic growth without the constraints of democratic institutions . '' 
But , he argued , the emerging Beijing Consensus `` takes seriously some aspirations of developing states often ignored or opposed by the West , '' such as `` a more equitable international distribution of wealth and power . '' 
As Beijing grows more assertive in international finance , it is working inside as well as outside existing organizations . 
In January , it joined the Inter-American Development Bank -- which is active in Latin America and the Caribbean -- as a donor country . 
It is in talks with the IMF to increase its contribution to the fund in exchange for more of a say in IMF policies . 
And in Asia , it is leading the push by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for a regional fund that will compete with the Asian Development Bank . 
This week , China 's allies Kazakhstan and Pakistan -- both of which recently got new loans from China -- threw their support behind calls from China 's central bank governor , Zhou Xiaochuan , to create a new world or Asian reserve currency to replace the dollar . 
Venezuelan President Hugo Ch vez , who also signed a credit line with China recently , has backed the proposal . 
In the past five months , China has signed $ 95 billion in currency swap agreements with six countries that now hold part of their reserves in yuan . 
The government has also begun to allow companies in southern China to settle contracts with foreign neighbors in yuan instead of dollars or euros . 
Nouriel Roubini , a professor at New York University who as far back as 2006 predicted a U.S. economic collapse triggered by a housing bubble , said in an interview that the financial crisis has shown that `` different countries grow in different ways , and nobody has the monopoly on that type of wisdom . '' 
While he does not expect any immediate change in the international monetary system , he said , in five to 10 years `` the Chinese currency could be the new reserve currency . '' 
But Michael Pettis , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a professor of finance at Peking University , says China 's recent moves are more about public relations and aiding diplomatic allies than a true effort to remake the global financial system or to push a new model of development . 
Beijing has long used foreign aid to encourage developing countries to stop recognizing Taiwan -- as Jamaica did in 1972 -- and the talk about creating a new international `` supercurrency '' may be mostly a warning to the United States not to cover mounting deficits simply by printing money . 
`` It 's about signaling concern about U.S. monetary policy , '' Pettis said . 
At an economic forum in the southern Chinese city of Boao last weekend , China 's leaders seized every opportunity to criticize Western countries and institutions . 
China 's top banking regulator , Liu Mingkang , called the recent Group of 20 meetings in London and Washington `` mainly lip service without many concrete actions . '' 
Former vice premier Zeng Peiyan said that if the United States wants to continue receiving `` foreign funding support , '' it should guarantee the value of its Treasury securities to countries that buy them . 
And Zheng Xinli , deputy head of the China Center for Economic Exchanges , an influential new research center , called for a new Asian development bank to compete with Western-dominated institutions .

"Amid serious concerns that the swine flu outbreak could worsen an already-deep recession in Mexico , the World Bank yesterday moved to provide that nation with millions in emergency aid and set up a special fund for longer-term assistance . 
Stung by the credit crunch and weaker demand for its products in the United States and beyond , Mexico is set to suffer a worse downturn than the one in the United States this year , with the International Monetary Fund predicting this week that its economy would contract by 3.7 percent . 
Adding to those troubles , Russia , the world 's second-largest pork importer , yesterday suspended all pork shipments from Mexico , as well as from three U.S. states , despite assurances from international health officials that the flu could not be transmitted through exposure to pork . 
Other countries have intensified screening of pork imports . 
And several nations have issued travel advisories to Mexico just as resorts there are gearing up for summer bookings . 
Speaking at the close of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund biannual meetings in Washington yesterday , Mexican Finance Minister Agustin Carstens warned that the outbreak could have an `` important '' economic impact . 
`` This issue can have an important impact on the economy , although the most important impact is the one on human life and human well-being , '' Carstens told reporters . 
He added that the outbreak was a `` very serious matter '' with `` a high potential for -LRB- economic -RRB- disruption . '' 
Earlier this decade , the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome -LRB- SARS -RRB- and bird flu strains in Asia dealt economic blows to more than a dozen nations , forcing airlines to cancel flights , hotels to slash rates and depressing consumer demand . 
In the case of bird flu , Asian farmers additionally had to cull tens of millions of poultry from their flocks . 
Mexico -- and perhaps even the United States if a full-blown outbreak were to spread north of the border -- could face similar problems just as it is struggling with the global financial crisis . 
Earlier this month , Mexico established a new $ 47 billion credit line with the IMF , funds that may provide an important cushion if its financial situation sharply deteriorates . 
The World Bank yesterday said it would roll out $ 25 million to Mexico in emergency funds for medicine and equipment , including for devices to detect the new strain of swine flu that has killed up to 86 people there . 
In addition , it said it was prepared to draw on an additional $ 180 million to help finance other needs related to the outbreak . 
The Mexican assistance came just as the World Bank warned yesterday that health programs in poor and middle-income nations were being severely hit by the financial crisis that started in the United States . 
A new report from the bank , for instance , indicated that in March eight countries were reporting shortages of HIV - and AIDS-related drugs and treatments , and an additional 14 said they expected to see disruptions in the coming weeks and months . 
Robert B. Zoellick , the World Bank 's president , yesterday said the institution was offering Mexico advice about how other nations have dealt with similar health crises . 
He noted that there would be a time to account for the economic toll , `` but for now , the focus is on people 's lives . ''

"Flu Outbreak Threatens Global Economic Recovery The outbreak is affecting trade . 
Russia , China and the Philippines , citing swine flu , suspended pork imports from Mexico and some U.S. states where the virus has been detected , despite the fact that health officials say there is no link between pork consumption and the virus . 
-LRB- By Aaron Favila -- Associated Press -RRB- The swine flu outbreak is compounding the ailments of the global economy just as it is starting to stabilize , darkening the outlook for everything from tourism to world trade , particularly in the United States and Mexico . 
In recent weeks , economic data suggested a bottoming-out of the global financial crisis . 
But economists yesterday were forced to digest worst-case scenarios in which a recession that is already the deepest since World War II could become two or three times as painful . 
That would be the consequence of a full-blown flu pandemic . 
But even if the outbreak were to remain relatively contained , economists warned of a new round of woes . 
Underscoring those concerns , airline stocks plunged yesterday amid fears of a replay of what happened earlier this decade in Asia , when outbreaks of bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome , known as SARS , emptied hotels and led to flight cancellations . 
The value of the Mexican peso took its steepest drop since November . 
And investors drove down the price of oil by 2.7 percent on fears that swine flu would slow global economic recovery . 
But the real focus of concern centered on a new dose of the last thing the world economy needs right now -- more uncertainty . 
`` The impact is to threaten the stabilization of the global downturn we 've been seeing over the last few weeks , '' said Brian Dolan , chief currency strategist for Forex.com . 
`` The timing could not be worse . '' 
The damage could hit the already ailing tourism and airline industries the hardest . 
The European Union and a number of nations began warning their citizens yesterday to avoid unnecessary travel to parts of North America . 
During the SARS outbreak in 2003 -- the last major epidemic of a respiratory disease with human-to-human transmission -- airline traffic to Asian destinations such as Hong Kong fell by as much as 60 percent . 
Overall , Asia-Pacific airlines lost 50 percent of traffic in the first five months of 2003 , causing them $ 6 billion in losses . 
North American carriers saw passenger traffic fall by 3.7 percent that year . 
This time , however , the global airline industry is already in deep crisis , raising the specter that deep losses could lead to forced consolidations or even requests for government bailouts . 
Though carriers have reported only limited cancellations so far , Continental Airlines saw its shares dive 16 percent yesterday , while United Airlines , Delta Air Lines and American Airlines saw declines of around 14 percent . 
With a number of nations from Spain to New Zealand reporting confirmed cases of swine flu , and countries including Russia and Taiwan moving to quarantine travelers showing flu-like symptoms , even Asian and European airline shares saw sharp sell-offs . 
The outbreak is also affecting trade . 
Russia , China and the Philippines , citing swine flu , suspended pork imports from Mexico and some U.S. states where the virus has been detected , despite the fact that health officials say there is no link between pork consumption and the virus . 
With trade barriers already on the rise because of the global downturn , other nations could pile on . 
Though Mexico 's pork industry could suffer from any new bans , the impact of such restrictions in the United States is less clear . 
Russia , for instance , is the fifth largest importer of U.S. pork , but since most U.S. production comes from states that have so far not confirmed cases of swine flu , industry leaders said there would be little immediate disruption . 
That said , they warned that Russia could extend the ban , and that other nations might follow suit . 
`` The concern is that regardless of the scientific evidence , other countries could use this as an excuse to restrict our exports , '' said David Warner , a spokesman for the U.S. National Pork Producers Council . 
`` Everyone is looking to protect their own right now . '' 
The economic impact of the outbreak could be amplified by the financial crisis , especially in Mexico , where restaurants and shopping malls were already closing in the capital , eating further into plunging retail sales . 
When SARS struck , by comparison , the global economy was in a period of broad expansion . 
The outbreak , according to the Asian Development Bank , cost East and Southeast Asian nations overall about 0.6 percent in economic growth in 2003 . 
This time , however , the global economy is anything but robust , magnifying potential new strains . 
The impact in the United States would be far greater in the case of a larger-scale pandemic , with the worst-case scenario akin to what happened during the Spanish flu of 1918 , which killed tens of millions of people worldwide . 
A 2006 report from the Congressional Budget Office estimated a pandemic , depending on its severity , could cost the United States between 1 percent to 4.1 percent of annual economic output . 
Given that the U.S. economy is expected to shrink by 2.8 percent this year , a pandemic could lead to a contraction of 3.9 percent to 6.9 percent as consumer demand and worker productivity suffer further .

"Book Review : ' A Failure of Capitalism ' by Richard A. Posner Harvard Univ. 346 pp . 
$ 23.95 In a recent column assessing the growing literature on the causes of the financial crisis , David Brooks noted that two broad schools of thought have formed : One sees the fiasco as a product of greed ; the other , stupidity . 
Brooks overlooked the school of thought named Richard A. Posner . 
Posner , the idiosyncratic and prolific federal jurist , has just published his book for this month : a surprising volume that explains what happened to the banking system and economy in terms the lay reader can easily understand . 
Posner gained broad public notice in the 1980s as the leader of a scholarly movement that analyzed legal questions through the prism of free-market economics . 
He ordinarily gets categorized as a conservative , which is fair enough if you like one-word labels . 
He does n't wring his hands over widows and orphans and sees the mission of judges as promoting unsentimental economic efficiency . 
But Posner , a Reagan appointee to the federal appeals court in Chicago , is no party man . 
The main villains in our current financial saga , he argues , are Wall Street idol Alan Greenspan and the hapless George W. Bush . 
As chairman of the Federal Reserve , Greenspan propped up stock prices by keeping interest rates low . 
That policy fueled the borrowing boom that brought us toxic subprime mortgages , reckless securitization and the credit default swaps notoriously hawked by American International Group . 
Bush , in Posner 's telling , accelerated a decades-old deregulatory surge that allowed everyone from Bear Stearns to Bernard Madoff to run wild . 
Then , when the whole crazy casino showed signs of crumbling in 2008 , Bush went AWOL , Posner writes : `` The lame-duck President seemed uninterested in and uninformed about economic matters and was unable to project an image of leadership and instead spent his final months in office in frequent trips abroad and in legacy-polishing while the domestic economy melted away . '' 
Posner knocks down greed or stupidity as a central reason for the crash . 
In his quirky way , he ca n't really understand the concept of avarice . 
He puts the word `` greed '' in quotes and follows it with the aside `` whatever that means . '' 
Posner argues that one man 's money lust is another 's rational profit maximization . 
If you allow aggressive traders and investment bankers to do whatever they want , of course they 're going to get into trouble ! 
He dismisses stupidity as an explanation , too , because , he contends , everyone knew exactly what they were doing . 
The home buyers knew they were borrowing too much . 
The lenders knew they were getting people in over their heads , and the Wall Street financiers knew that bonds confected from dubious mortgages were n't really safe . 
Everyone hoped that housing prices would keep rising so they could come out on top , no matter how unrealistic the whole hybrid pyramid-Ponzi scheme seems when you stop and think about it . 
All economic bubbles eventually burst , and that 's what happened to real estate . 
Rather than castigate greed or stupidity , Posner prefers to emphasize that smart regulators could have contained the damage . 
Greenspan could have put a floor under interest rates and taken the inevitable political heat . 
Other fans of the free market could have anticipated that deregulating trucking , airlines , telecommunications and energy -- a policy that Posner generally applauds -- did n't dictate also unleashing bankers . 
When trucking companies or airlines fail , they hurt themselves and their employees ; when big banks fail , they send a chill through the entire economy that freezes credit and brings business to its knees . 
Posner does n't offer an agenda for reining in Wall Street . 
Perhaps he had moved on to the next three books he 's writing -- or his blogs . 
But even without constructive proposals for reform , his critique is bracing , all the more so because it comes from a right-leaning thinker normally hostile to the ministrations of government bureaucrats . 
My only complaint is that his title is confusing . 
Rather than a failure of capitalism , Posner warns of the dangers of an absence of rational oversight . 
And his preference for calling our troubles a depression , instead of a recession , seems excessively bleak , at least for the moment . 
Let 's enact some thoughtful regulation and hope for the best .

"Is this what the first trade war of the global economic crisis looks like ? 
Ordered by Congress to `` buy American '' when spending money from the $ 787 billion stimulus package , the town of Peru , Ind. , stunned its Canadian supplier by rejecting sewage pumps made outside of Toronto . 
After a Navy official spotted Canadian pipe fittings in a construction project at Camp Pendleton , Calif. , they were hauled out of the ground and replaced with American versions . 
In recent weeks , other Canadian manufacturers doing business with U.S. state and local governments say they have been besieged with requests to sign affidavits pledging that they will only supply materials made in the USA . 
Outrage spread in Canada , with the Toronto Star last week bemoaning `` a plague of protectionist measures in the U.S. '' and Canadian companies openly fretting about having to shift jobs to the United States to meet made-in-the-USA requirements . 
This week , the Canadians fired back . 
A number of Ontario towns , with a collective population of nearly 500,000 , retaliated with measures effectively barring U.S. companies from their municipal contracts -- the first shot in a larger campaign that could shut U.S. companies out of billions of dollars worth of Canadian projects . 
This is not your father 's trade war , a tit-for-tat over champagne or cheese . 
With countries worldwide desperately trying to keep and create jobs in the midst of a global recession , the spat between the United States and its normally friendly northern neighbor underscores what is emerging as the biggest threat to open commerce during the economic crisis . 
Rather than merely raising taxes on imported goods -- acts that are subject to international treaties -- nations including the United States are finding creative ways to engage in protectionism through domestic policy decisions that are largely not governed by international law . 
Unlike a classic trade war , there is little chance of containment through , for example , arbitration at the World Trade Organization in Geneva . 
Additionally , such moves are more likely to have unintended consequences or even backfire on the stated desire to create domestic jobs . 
Take , for instance , Duferco Farrell Corp. , a Swiss-Russian partnership that took over a previously bankrupt U.S. steel plant near Pittsburgh in the 1990s and employed 600 people there . 
The new buy American provisions , the company said , are being so broadly interpreted that Duferco Farrell is on the verge of shutting down . 
Part of an increasingly global supply chain that seeks efficiencies by spreading production among multiple nations , it manufactures coils at its Pennsylvania plant using imported steel slabs that are generally not sold commercially in the United States . 
The partially foreign production process means the company 's coils do not fit the current definition of made in the USA -- a designation that the stimulus law requires for thousands of public works projects across the nation . 
In recent weeks , its largest client -- a steel pipemaker located one mile down the road -- notified Duferco Farrell that it would be canceling orders . 
Instead , the client is buying from companies with 100 percent U.S. production to meet the new stimulus regulations . 
Duferco has had to furlough 80 percent of its workforce . 
`` You need to tell me how inhibiting business between two companies located one mile apart is going to save American jobs , '' said Bob Miller , Duferco Farrell 's executive vice president . 
`` I 've got 600 United Steel Workers out there who are going to lose their jobs because of this . 
And you tell me this is good for America ? '' 
The United States is not alone in throwing up domestic policies assailed by critics as protectionist . 
Britain and the Netherlands , for instance , are forcing banks receiving taxpayer bailouts to jump-start lending at home at the expense of overseas clients . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy initially insisted that his nation 's automakers move manufacturing jobs home in exchange for a government bailout , but backed down after outrage surged among his peers in the European Union , of which France is a central member . 
But the number of measures , both proposed and enacted , from the Obama administration and Congress in recent months has raised an alarm among foreign governments , pundits and news media outlets . 
The buy American provisions in the stimulus package , signed into law in February , were just the beginning . 
Last week , Obama unveiled a series of proposals aimed at increasing taxes by nearly $ 200 billion over the next decade on U.S. companies doing business abroad . 
At a White House event , Obama said the measures were designed to `` close corporate loopholes '' that permit companies to `` pay lower taxes if you create a job in Bangalore , India , than if you create one in Buffalo , N.Y. '' A slew of legislative proposals is also aimed at keeping jobs at home . 
In recent weeks , the House attached additional buy American provisions to a $ 14 billion clean-water fund that provides loans to local communities and a $ 6 billion program to finance environmentally friendly school construction projects .

"At Geithner 's Treasury , Key Decisions on Hold Seven weeks after the Treasury Department announced that it was ousting General Motors chief G. Richard Wagoner Jr. in the federal bailout of the company , he is still technically on GM 's payroll . 
Wagoner 's removal has been held up because senior Treasury officials have yet to decide whether he should get the $ 20 million severance package that the company had promised him . 
The delay is one of many hitches that have slowed a host of important policy actions in the four months since Timothy F. Geithner became Treasury secretary . 
While Geithner has taken dramatic steps to address flashpoints in the economy , the work of carrying out those policies has bogged down because critical decisions about how to do so are n't being made , interviews with a broad range of federal officials show . 
Government officials , inside the Treasury and out , say the unresolved issues are piling up in part because of vacancies in the department 's top ranks . 
But some of the officials also cite the Treasury 's ad-hoc management , which is dominated by a small band of Geithner 's counselors who coordinate rescue initiatives but lack formal authority to make decisions . 
Heavy involvement by the White House in Treasury affairs has further muddied the picture of who is responsible for key issues , the officials add . 
One of the department 's signature initiatives , considered vital for getting at the root of the financial crisis , aims at relieving banks of their toxic assets . 
But to those familiar with the program , it remains unclear who will decide some of the practical details , such as whether foreign firms will be allowed to participate in the funds that buy the assets . 
This uncertainty is slowing the rollout of the program , which in any case has proven daunting to design . 
Announced in early February , it may not launch until July , officials say . 
In March , Treasury officials clashed over a $ 15 billion initiative to use money from the federal bailout package to free up credit for small businesses . 
Geithner 's counselors pressed to announce the program quickly , despite protests from the career staff members who said it would not work . 
Unable to raise the issue with Geithner himself , the staff members appealed directly to the White House but were rebuffed , according to sources familiar with the episode . 
President Obama announced the program two months ago , and it is still struggling to get off the ground . 
Officials are looking to overhaul the proposal . 
And in the wake of the public firestorm over bonuses paid by American International Group , senior Treasury officials have been meeting several times a week all spring to review , one by one , the payments to the company 's executives . 
But the time-consuming discussions have never resolved whether any of the executives should get paid . 
Geithner said in interviews that some of the department 's internal difficulties result from the intense pressure on officials to develop a raft of rescue initiatives in a very short time . 
`` We were just putting enormous pressure on these people to put in place and execute this comprehensive set of programs , '' Geithner said . 
`` In a crisis , the most important thing is to show the capacity for credible initiative that is actually going to fix the problem . 
That 's why we are trying to do so much so early . '' 
He added , `` It could get tough at times ... but I think they are doing a great job in that context , and they are working 24 hours a day to put out A-plus policy . '' 
Still , some lawmakers and government officials said Geithner needs to be a stronger manager . 
`` No one knows how to get decisions made , '' said a senior government official familiar with the Treasury 's inner workings . 
`` Major decisions can happen very fast at the top , and then after that there are tons of detail and nuances that have to get worked out without clear chains of command . 
Either the seats are unfilled ... or you have to answer to a half a dozen counselors running around . ''

Yale 's Gary Gorton -- gah , so much bold ! 
-- has an interesting new paper called `` Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand : Banking and the Panic of 2007 . '' 
Gorton 's paper attempts to explain the `` where '' of the panic . 
The banks did n't fall because individual investors lined up on the street for an old-fashioned bank run . 
They fell because other banks concocted a new sort of bank run . 
This happened , Gorton says , in the `` sale and repossession market '' -LRB- the repo market -RRB- , where large institutional investors deposited big chunks of short-term cash and banks insured that cash by offering collateral -- a senior tranche of securities , say -- in return . 
When the subprime crisis hit , this all fell apart , and fast . 
`` Uncertain about the solvency of counterparties , repo depositors became concerned that the collateral bonds might not be liquid ; if all firms wanted to hold cash a flight to quality then collateral would have to decline in price to find buyers . 
This is the crucial link between the subprime shock and other asset categories . '' 
Here 's the key graph : `` The size of the haircut reflects the credit risk of the borrower and the riskiness of the pledged collateral , '' Gorton writes . 
As the crisis wears on , the system judges the collateral -LRB- in this case , structured debt -RRB- to be riskier and demands much larger haircuts . 
Suddenly the depositor is offering only $ 85 for collateral worth $ 100 in today 's market . 
The reason is simple enough : He 's worried that the collateral will only be worth $ 50 in tomorrow 's market . 
The $ 15 difference is his price on the risk . 
But if the banks ca n't borrow as much off the same pool of collateral , they have to finance their balance sheet some other way . 
Which depresses asset prices . 
And so we 're off to the -LRB- recessionary -RRB- races . 
But the telling bit of that chart , as Steven Pearlstein pointed out to me , is not the area where the line jags upward . 
It 's at the beginning , where it hugs the X axis . 
That 's where the system thinks itself effectively invulnerable : where the people buying structured debt are not asking for any risk premium . 
Where they are n't building in any serious risk of default or decline . 
Where they 're treating collateral almost like cash . 
Like there was no chance any of this could happen . 
Nobody wants to bring up the huge commissions these people were raking in for trading this carp among themselves . 
And somebody thinks we need to pay them these huge bonuses to keep them around . 
They should be paying us back . 
Where they 're treating collateral almost like cash . 
Like there was no chance any of this could happen . '' 
Ezra , it 's not entirely clear from your post whether you realize this , but it 's important to remember that repo trades are margined , typically on a daily basis . 
So if the value falls by more than a certain threshold amount , the `` seller '' has to put up more collateral . 
And of course , even if the collateral defaults or falls to zero , the `` seller '' is still on the hook for the whole cash amount . 
So it 's not strictly true to say that they were n't building in any serious risk of default or decline . 
They were n't building in any serious risk of default or decline combined with the default of the `` buyer '' . 
It 's also worth noting that , at least since the crisis hit , repo trades have been very short term - overnight to a couple of weeks in most cases . 
So even with a subprime RMBS , the chances of it going from AAA to defaulting are pretty damn slim . 
But the essence of the repo market is that it 's supposed to be as riskless as interbank lending gets , hence the large haircuts .

How Inequality Accelerated the Financial Crisis Historian Niall Ferguson took to the New York Times this morning to argue that `` if deregulation is to blame for the recession that began in December 2007 , presumably it should also get some of the credit for the intervening growth . '' 
This does n't make sense on two levels . 
First , it 's a straw man . 
Deregulation is n't to blame for the recession that began in December 2007 . 
You can make an argument that an absence of new regulation was to blame . 
But it 's not as if we shuttered the agency regulating credit default swaps in 2006 . 
That agency never really existed . 
The regulatory state did n't keep pace with the financial sector . 
Second , the point itself is illogical . 
It 's like saying , `` if driving drunk is to blame for me hitting the tree in my front yard , then it should also get some credit for getting me there in the first place . '' 
The relevant question is what would have happened if you were n't driving drunk . 
The answer , probably , is you would have arrived at your destination without hitting the tree . 
Similarly , the question is what the financial sector would have looked like with a sounder regulatory regime . 
Ferguson does n't entertain the counterfactual , and so does n't prove his point . 
But he did spur Matthew Yglesias to post this graph tracking wage growth over the past 30 years , which bears on a related counterfactual : As Matt writes , `` for the top one percent , that s a pretty impressive period . 
For the next 19 percent , there s something happening . 
But for the bottom 80 percent , there s just very little going on in terms of real income growth . '' 
Two things emerged from this . 
First , the middle class wanted to maintain , and even expand , its standard of living . 
So it went into debt . 
It borrowed on credit cards and refinanced its mortgages . 
Bad news , as we 're seeing now . 
Second , the new money in the economy was disproportionately concentrated in the bank accounts of the richest of the rich . 
But at some point , even the very wealthy run out of vintage wines to purchase . 
So they put that money to work making them more money . 
They funneled it towards the financial sector and created a massive new market for financial innovation . 
Conversely , you could imagine a counterfactual where growth was more equitably distributed and the middle class saw their incomes rise . 
Rather than buying financial products , they would have bought things . 
In the aggregate , they would have used the money to consume rather than to make more money . 
And that would likely have kept the financial sector somewhat more in check .

By Ezra Klein | May 19 , 2009 ; 2:09 PM ET The graph you post is a glaring example of the sad state of our society . 
The rich have gotten richer and the rest of us have been part of a Ponzi scheme wherein our homes got ` higher ' in value because , well , everyone THOUGHT they should - even when it was obvious that few people could afford the prices as they escalated . 
Since wages were stagnant , the only way to buy things to keep the economy going was through bogus home ` equity ' and credit cards . 
Of course , at some point people began to realize they could never pay back what they owed . 
At this point , considering that the ten percent of the country who owns the vast majority of the wealth in this country will never share it with the other ninety percent and wages are never going to make up the difference , perhaps now would be a good time to announce that all credit card balances will be reset to zero and all home equity loans will be forgiven . 
That would certainly pump up the economy as regular people would have more money . 
Maybe you 're just trying to be countersarcastic . 
I certainly hope so . 
Although I agree with your second point , the first point is just plain not true . 
The repeal of Glass-Steagal was one major deregulation that took place -- combining banks and investment banks -- that helped cause this mess . 
Then , there are the regulators who gave nice little warnings about `` exotic mortgages '' that turned into `` toxic assets . '' 
Interest-only loans to unsophisticated borrowers ? 
Give me a break . 
Just doing those loans in the first place turned houses into stock certificates so that we saw a replay of the manic dot-com bubble take place . 
Only this time , they were tied to houses to mortgages to credit default swaps , derivatives , etc. b\/c Glass-Stegal was repealed . 
Niall Ferguson said we have to credit how we got here , but we got here under false pretenses -- driven by Wall Street greed that trickled down and perpetuated the greed embodied in human nature . 
However , Ferguson did a great job explaining this mess in `` The Ascent of Money , '' a PBS documentary well worth watching . 
As for the middle-class buying things rather than investing with their hard-earned money ... is n't that the Reagan\/Bush materialistic quotient that put us here in the first place ? 
Compare another graph of the amount of debt that started rising in 1980-present and how unemployment continued to decline as private sector debt increased . 
Then you see what this economy has been all about for almost 30 years . 
Just maybe , we 're coming into a time when money is not the be-all and end-all , and we move away from F. Scott Fitzgerald 's `` The Great Gatsby '' to a culture with more substance . 
That way , we save , compound interest and do n't feel that we 're losers for not making a million dollars a year . 
I know this sounds crazy , but it is only money . 
Unfortunately , so many people have lost jobs these days that now they really do have to worry about earning it to survive . 
`` Trickle down '' has worked brilliantly for that top tier of wage earners . 
Not so well for those below ... the trickle never seemed to go down . 
And it 's nice that the `` deregulation '' we 've seen in the last couple of decades has proven once and for all that the highly compensated , highly educated guys in finance ca n't function properly without the feds acting like a helicopter parent , propping up the bankers with rules , regulations and the riches of a bailout . 
Yes , I believe that tax policies favoring the rich have helped the rich get richer , which created vast pools of money that could n't be spent , which was then used to finance all this wonderful financial innovation ... we know the rest . 
Yes consumers need to delever and pay down debt and live within their means , but how do we increase their means ? 
It looks like the last 30 years of growth have been a mirage , supported by low savings and high debt rather than real growth . 
But the US now lives in a global world where there is immense downward pressure on American wages , particularly in low skill\/low substitution cost professions . 
I guess education plays a piece but it 's not a magic bullet . 
The real question is how do we find sustainable wage growth for the vast middle class ? 
I emailed Matt Yglesias a heads-up about this and I think I just about have him convinced . 
That graph does n't show what he says it shows , because it measures HOUSEHOLDS , not individuals . 
It 's easy to miss because it does n't say that on the title of the graph , just at the top of the CBO web-page that Matt links . 
Yes , real household income , at least for the median and the lower four quintiles , has stagnated for thirty years -LRB- more than that , actually -RRB- . 
The reason , though , is that household size has been shrinking dramatically as more people delay marriage or can afford to live alone . 
What may have been a three-person household in 1979 is now as low as two . 
The fact that most of the much smaller households of today earn the same real income as much larger households of thirty years back -LRB- and a not-insignificant number earn much more -RRB- is in itself a remarkable sign of growth . 
If you want to make the point Matt makes , you need to look for a chart that shows PER CAPITA income by HOUSEHOLD income quintile . 
That would show you what the average person in a `` rich '' household can consume compared to the average person in a `` poor '' household . 
Until you put up that data , though , you ca n't say that real incomes have stagnated . 
In the meantime , you really should clarify the point .

"The Obama administration is actively discussing the creation of a regulatory commission that would have broad authority to protect consumers who use financial products as varied as mortgages , credit cards and mutual funds , according to several sources familiar with the matter . 
The proposed commission would be one of the administration 's most significant steps yet to overhaul the financial regulatory system . 
It would also be one of its first proposals to address causes of the financial crisis such as predatory mortgage lending . 
Plans for a new body remain fluid , but it could be granted broad powers to make sure the terms and marketing of a wide range of loans and other financial products are in the interests of ordinary consumers , sources said . 
Sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity because discussions are ongoing , said talks have begun with industry officials , lawmakers and other financial experts about the proposal , which would require legislation . 
Last night , senior policymakers , including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and National Economic Council Director Lawrence H. Summers , were to discuss the idea at a dinner held at the Treasury Department . 
Responsibility for regulation of consumer financial products is currently distributed among a patchwork of federal agencies . 
Some of these regulators regard consumer protection as a low priority . 
And some financial products are not regulated at all . 
The proposal could centralize enforcement of existing laws and create a vehicle for imposing tougher rules . 
The idea is likely to face significant opposition from industry groups , which argue that stricter regulation limits the availability of financial products to consumers . 
It could also trigger a massive regulatory turf war . 
Banking regulators and agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission , which regulates mutual funds , could stand to lose powers , personnel and funding . 
Those agencies are likely to argue they are positioned to protect consumers because they oversee the financial firms directly and have experience writing and enforcing rules governing financial products . 
The proposal is part of the administration 's broader plan to improve financial regulation . 
Officials have proposed the creation of a systemic risk regulator whose job would be to spot threats to the health of the overall financial system . 
Officials also have called for tighter regulation of individual financial firms and markets , including new rules governing hedge funds and derivatives . 
While those proposals focus on the guts of the financial system , this new plan would concentrate on the front end -- consumers who borrow money to buy homes and products and who invest their money for retirement , college education and savings . 
The leading proponent of such a commission is Elizabeth Warren , a Harvard University law professor who now chairs the Congressional Oversight Panel for the government 's financial rescue initiative . 
Her plan is the kernel of the idea the White House is now considering , sources said . 
Warren wrote in a 2007 article in the journal Democracy that the government had failed to protect American consumers in their relationships with financial companies . 
`` It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house . 
But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out on the street , '' Warren wrote . 
`` Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible consumer products with cash , but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors ? '' 
Warren proposed creating a new commission modeled on the Consumer Product Safety Commission , which protects buyers of products such as bicycles and baby cribs . 
Such a commission could be very powerful . 
A number of sweeping federal laws already offer broad protection to consumers of financial products , but those laws have been lightly enforced in recent years . 
The Department of Housing and Urban Development , for example , has clear authority to crack down on companies that charge excessive closing costs on mortgage loans , but repeatedly postponed planned reforms in the face of industry opposition . 
Warren 's proposal initially found little support in Washington , but the mood has shifted dramatically with the onset of the financial crisis and the election of a Democratic administration . 
In March , Sen. Richard J. Durbin -LRB- D-Ill . -RRB- 
introduced legislation to create a commission like the one that Warren had described . 
The legislation is co-sponsored by Sen. Charles E. Schumer -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- . 
The White House 's support would greatly improve its chances of passing . 
In proposing the legislation , the senators said that the commission would be responsible for identifying emerging problems and for educating consumers . 
They were also critical of the existing process . 
`` The Federal Reserve was supposed to do this , but they were asleep at the switch , '' Schumer said at the time .

"Florida-based BankUnited collapsed yesterday , the largest bank failure so far this year , as a new federal investigation revealed that the bank 's regulator , the Office of Thrift Supervision , allowed the firm to cover up its financial weakness . 
A consortium of investors , including District-based private-equity giant Carlyle Group , agreed to buy and recapitalize BankUnited , the fourth-largest bank to fail since the onset of the financial crisis . 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it expects to absorb $ 4.9 billion in losses . 
It is the second major bank failure involving allegations that OTS , the primary regulator of banks that concentrate in mortgage lending , allowed a bank to obscure its problems from investors . 
OTS has previously acknowledged allowing IndyMac , which failed last summer , to conceal its problems in a financial filing . 
A report yesterday by the Treasury Department 's inspector general accused OTS of permitting three more banks to file misleading reports about their financial condition . 
In the case of Coral Gables-based BankUnited , OTS had ordered the company to raise additional capital and it had been unable to meet a deadline to do so , the report said . 
OTS 's senior deputy director allowed the company to raise the money after the deadline and then to issue a financial report stating that the money had been raised before the deadline , the report said . 
The inspector general 's report describes BankUnited 's case but does not name the senior deputy director . 
The inspector general 's office confirmed the bank was BankUnited . 
Scott Polakoff was the only senior deputy director at OTS during the period . 
Polakoff stepped down this year from his position as acting director of the agency after the inspector general brought his actions to the attention of Treasury officials . 
`` We consider these matters very serious and find it alarming , '' the inspector general wrote in the report . 
In the case of California-based IndyMac , a top OTS official authorized the bank to backdate capital last year , according to the report . 
The senior OTS official in the Western United States , Darryl Dochow , resigned after the incident was disclosed . 
A second bank in the Southeast was told it could not backdate capital last year , did not comply and faced no consequences . 
OTS discovered that a third bank in the Northeast had backdated capital last year , but no action was taken .

"Former Assistant Treasury Secretary for Financial Institutions -LRB- May 2009 to January 2011 -RRB- When Barr first joined the Treasury during the Clinton administration , he was a neophyte . 
Out of law school for only three years , Barr was named to the plum post of special assistant to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin . 
The University of Michigan law professor worked as a senior fellow at the liberal Washington think-tank the Brookings Institution . 
At Brookings , he authored papers outlining how the government should help banks aid the poor , and called for government intervention in the mortgage market months before Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008 . 
After financial regulatory reform was enacted in July 2010 , Barr was a leading contender , along with Elizabeth Warren , to head the independent consumer protection board it created . 
Warren was named as an adviser to create the board , and Barr announced in Novemebr 2010 that he would return to his academic post at Michigan . 
More on : Michael S. Barr Career History : Professor at the University of Michigan Law School -LRB- 2001 to 2008 -RRB- ; Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Treasury -LRB- 1997 to 2001 -RRB- ; Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury -LRB- 1995 to 1997 -RRB- Alma Mater : Yale University , B.A. -LRB- history -RRB- , 1987 ; Oxford University , M. Phil , 1989 ; Yale Law School , J.D. , 1992 A native of the Beltway enclosing the nation 's capital , Barr grew up with a mom who taught high school English and a dad who worked in labor law . 
For college he went to Yale University to study history , where he developed an interest in South African affairs . 
Barr even joined the Coalition Against Apartheid , a group that protested Yale 's investments in companies that did business in South Africa while the forced segregation continued in the African nation . 
Barr nearly let his personal feelings about apartheid get in the way of his academic accomplishments . 
In 1986 , he almost chose not to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship in protest of the award 's creator , early-19th-century British financier Cecil J. Rhodes , a controversial figure who gained success and wealth by mining diamonds in South Africa . 
But he reasoned that the award committee ensured that women and minorities have an equal opportunity to receive the scholarship , so he opted to apply and won the scholarship . 
In 1989 , Barr earned a master 's at Magdalen College at Oxford University . 
Shortly afterwards , Barr returned to Yale to earn a law degree in 1992 . 
In 1995 , Barr first joined the Treasury Department as special assistant to the secretary . 
He worked under Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin for two years , until he got a promotion in 1997 to deputy assistant secretary for community development policy . 
From 1999 to 2001 , while serving as a deputy assistant at the Treasury , Barr also worked as a special adviser to President Clinton . 
When Clinton 's presidency ended in 2001 , Barr moved to Ann Arbor to teach at the University of Michigan law school , specializing in financial institutions , international finance and transnational law . 
Barr also worked as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , a liberal think-tank from which Obama has culled many administration aides . 
In his return trip to Treasury , Barr brings with him a vast knowledge of credit-card systems and has often argued for more government banking initiatives that serve the poor . 
Long before the financial crisis exploded , Barr called in January 2008 for government intervention in stopping home foreclosures . 
Prior to the government bailout of Bear Stearns and the demise of Lehman Brothers , Barr testified before the Senate Banking Committee for government intervention in the mortgage market . 
In a hearing discussing the likelihood of a rash of foreclosures , Barr was asked whether he believed the government should create programs to save people 's homes . 
`` I do n't think we can afford to wait , '' said Barr , who was working as a Brookings senior fellow and a University of Michigan professor at the time . 
`` I think that the easy trap , in financial crisis , is to wait too long and do too little and watch the bad news dribble out , and not be on top of it . '' 
`` I think , if you look at the evidence of intervention in financial crises in the past , in serious financial crises , they are far more -- those interventions are far more successful if they 're done rapidly and at scale , rather than dribbled out and slowly . '' 
As bad bets on subprime mortgages crippled financial institution toward the end of 2008 , Barr continued to testify before Congress . 
In the same congressional hearing where Bush Treasury official Neel Kashkari was asked by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings -LRB- D-Md . -RRB- 
if banks thought he was a `` chump '' for the way the Treasury had handled the bailout funds , Barr testified on ways those funds could be used to stave off foreclosures . 
Barr pointed out that the bailout legislation authorized the Treasury to `` purchase troubled assets , including home mortgage loans . '' 
Barr called for the Treasury to help stem home foreclosures by guaranteeing home loans to the `` servicers '' who controlled the subprime loans for mortgage-backed securities ' investors . 
In order to avoid liability and extra taxes , the servicers often foreclosed on those unable to pay their mortgages instead of restructuring the loans . 
Barr also called for the Treasury to allow the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to guarantee the loans and bolster the Federal Housing Administration , which needed more resources to aid in the foreclosure crisis . 
From 1995 to 1997 , Barr served as Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin 's special assistant . 
While there , Obama National Economic Adviser Lawrence H. Summers worked as Rubin 's deputy secretary . 
In 1999 , while Barr worked as deputy assistant secretary for Community Development Policy at Treasury , he tackled the dual role of executive director of the District of Columbia task force at the Office of Managament and Budget . 
Obama 's new OMB director , Jack Lew , served as OMB director from 1999 to 2001 . 
When Barr worked for Clinton 's State Department , he advised Director of the Policy Planning Staff James W. Steinberg . 
Steinberg joined the Obama administration as deputy secretary of state . 
Barr joined Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner 's team in May 2009 , and works closely with Deputy Secretary Neal S. Wolin , Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Alan B. Krueger and Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Helen Elizabeth Garrett . 
After attending law school , Barr clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter .

"In France , Social Programs Shield Many From Economic Downturn MENTON , France -- In recent years , Jean Beaufranqui and his wife have spent most of their time in Menton , enjoying the sunshine and gentle Mediterranean breezes that have made this little town into a retirement haven , France 's version of Miami Beach . 
And now , even as the world reels from its most painful economic crisis since the 1930s , Beaufranqui 's thoughts have turned not to budget cuts but to buying an apartment here and settling in full time . 
As a retiree -- he stopped working almost 19 years ago , at the standard age of 60 -- the former metallurgist has sailed smoothly through the economic storm as the French government regularly deposited his monthly pension payments . 
`` Not really , '' he responded when asked whether the financial crisis had affected his standard of living , a question that seemed to interest him less than the petanque bowling tournament he was watching from a park bench beside the beach . 
For Beaufranqui and millions of other French people dependent on tax-financed largess , this country 's cozy social protections , vast numbers of bureaucrats and unhesitating government intervention have proved to be a shelter from want in these hard economic times . 
Denounced for decades as a millstone preventing growth and competitiveness , particularly by free-market advocates in the United States , the French government 's dominant role in economic activity has suddenly found new favor at home and grudging respect abroad . 
The crisis has landed hard in France , just as it has elsewhere . 
European Union specialists estimated last week that the number of unemployed is likely to rise to more than 3 million by next year as factories close . 
But the French economy is expected to shrink by just 3 percent , markedly less than in Britain or Italy , largely because of the country 's traditionally high level of government spending , they added . 
More significant in human terms , broad sectors of the population -- bureaucrats , retirees , teachers and the millions of others whose livelihood depends directly or indirectly on public outlays -- find themselves surrounded by a government cushion . 
The effects are easy to see : As the crisis grew and began to obsess French officialdom in Paris , for instance , Alpine ski resorts reported full bookings for the winter and spring seasons . 
Perhaps nowhere has the buffer effect been more evident than in Menton , a Riviera town where a third of the population is retired and the largest employers -- City Hall , the hospital and a municipal casino just off the beach -- are government-run . 
Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal , who also represents Menton in the National Assembly , said the city has suffered no large layoffs in the economic crisis for the simple reason that it has no factories to lose ; service jobs catering to retired people have endured . 
`` The retired people constitute an element of stability , '' Guibal said in an interview in City Hall , at the top of a square sloping toward the sea , shaded by palm trees and ringed by cafe terraces under stucco arcades . 
The crisis has been felt here , of course . 
Fabrice Massiere , a cheese merchant at the Menton Market , said his business was off sharply because the number of visitors has declined . 
Guibal said income from the casino and tax revenue on real estate transactions have sunk , forcing him to raise property taxes for the first time in 13 years . 
But the heavy dependence on government subsidies or official salaries , he added , has put an economic fence around a large part of the Menton region 's 66,000 inhabitants . 
`` This makes us less sensitive to the fluctuations of the world economy , '' said Guibal , who described himself as a free-market advocate and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy 's pro-business coalition . 
Sarkozy , a free-market champion who was elected in 2007 on a pledge to help France `` work more and earn more , '' has insisted the crisis will not deter him from trying to reduce the government 's involvement in the economy . 
A senior aide , Henri Guaino , said in a television interview this month , for instance , that Sarkozy will continue to replace only half of the bureaucrats who retire from ministries and other government agencies .

"They want Brooksley Born to say four words , four simple words : `` I told you so . '' 
Ah , but she wo n't -- not at legal conferences or dinner parties . 
Not even in a quiet moment in her living room , giving her first interview with a major news organization since last fall 's economic collapse . 
She just smiles , perched ever so properly in an upholstered armchair at her Kalorama home . 
`` More coffee ? '' 
she asks daintily , changing the subject . 
A little more than a decade ago , Born foresaw a financial cataclysm , accurately predicting that exotic investments known as over-the-counter derivatives could play a crucial role in a crisis much like the one now convulsing America . 
Her efforts to stop that from happening ran afoul of some of the most influential men in Washington , men with names like Greenspan and Levitt and Rubin and Summers -- the same Larry Summers who is now a key economic adviser to President Obama . 
She was the head of a tiny government agency who wanted to regulate the derivatives . 
They were the men who stopped her . 
The same class of derivatives that preoccupied Born -- including the now-infamous `` credit-default swaps '' -- have been blamed for accelerating last fall 's financial implosion . 
But from 1996 to 1999 , when Born was the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , the U.S. economy was roaring and she was getting nowhere with predictions of doom . 
So , upstairs in the big house in Kalorama , Born tossed and turned . 
She woke repeatedly `` in a cold sweat , '' agonizing that a financial calamity was coming , she recalled one recent afternoon . 
`` I was really terribly worried , '' she said . 
Before taking office , Born had been a high-octane attorney , an American Bar Association power player , a noted advocate of feminist causes and co-founder of the National Women 's Law Center . 
But none of that carried much weight when she crossed over into government ; for all her legal experience , she was a woman who was n't adept at playing the game . 
She could be unyielding and coldly analytical , with a litigator 's absolute assertions of right and wrong . 
And she was taking on Beltway pros , masters of nuance and palace politics . 
She marched into congressional hearing after congressional hearing -- pin neat , always with a handbag -- but no one really wanted to listen . 
The Wall Street Journal declared that `` the nation 's top financial regulators wish Brooksley Born would just shut up . '' 
The Bond Buyer newspaper compared her to a salmon `` swimming against raging currents . ''

"We 're about to mark the anniversary of the financial meltdown . 
But do n't expect to see any clinking of champagne glasses , because except for a handful of prescient -LRB- or lucky -RRB- investors , it 's been a ghastly two years . 
The nightmare started June 12 , 2007 , when news broke that two Bear Stearns hedge funds speculating in mortgage-backed securities were melting down . 
That was the precursor to the panics and collapses that have led to a worldwide recession and the fall of mighty institutions like Bear , American International Group , Lehman Brothers and Royal Bank of Scotland . 
But even a clinkless anniversary has its uses -- it 's an occasion to reflect on the past and contemplate the future . 
So let 's look at what the meltdown is really about , the underrated impact of Lehman 's collapse , and where we go from here . 
Yes , the meltdown started with subprime mortgages -- subprime is a Wall Street euphemism for junk but can spread far beyond that . 
Problem areas now include credit cards , construction loans , office buildings , shopping centers , leveraged buyouts , nonjunk mortgages , and the various and sundry securities based on all that stuff . 
So even if the U.S. housing market were miraculously restored to health tomorrow -- not likely -- we 'd still have major grief . 
What almost everyone -LRB- including me -RRB- missed two years ago is that the world 's financial system was a disaster-in-waiting . 
It was clear that housing prices , leveraged buyouts and such were being driven by vast amounts of money looking for something to buy , no matter how idiotic . 
What was n't clear is how the markets are interlinked and internationalized . 
Thus , piggish behavior in the United States -- financial swine flu , as it were -- sped around the world even faster than regular swine flu has . 
Enter , or rather exit , Lehman , which failed in September 2008 . 
Financial markets freaked out , for reasons we 'll get to . 
The markets ' problems dragged down the economy , creating a slowdown that 's been putting a second hurt on the markets . 
It 's the first time we 've seen this pattern since the Great Depression . 
Letting Lehman croak seemed rational , after the uproar six months earlier when taxpayers bailed out Bear Stearns 's creditors and allowed Bear shareholders to get $ 10 a share for stock that was essentially worthless . 
But the unexpected consequences of Lehman 's failure scared the pants off the world 's financial-crisis managers . 
First , because of a little-noted 2005 change in U.S. bankruptcy laws , Lehman 's counterparties -- the institutions on the other side of huge bets that Lehman made -- were able to seize and sell the collateral that Lehman had posted . 
Those sales drove down asset prices , inflicting huge losses on other institutions and fomenting fear as institutions grew ever more wary of dealing with one another . 
Second , Lehman 's collapse led to Reserve Primary Fund becoming the first sizable money market fund to `` break the buck '' and inflict capital losses on investors . 
That scared millions of people . 
Finally , some hedge funds that had Lehman as their prime broker -- the institution that holds their securities and cash and does their transactions -- could n't access their assets after the bankruptcy . 
Other funds began moving their prime brokerage accounts out of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , which as investment banks could n't use all the Federal Reserve 's emergency-borrowing programs . 
That put the two in a bind and forced them to become bank holding companies . 
These unexpected consequences of Lehman 's collapse help explain why U.S. regulators have been so solicitous of the 19 big `` stress test '' institutions . 
Who wants to close , say , Citi , and be responsible for a Lehman II ? 
Despite the huge stock market run-up the past three months , things are still far from cheery . 
The government 's rescue strategy seems to be the traditional `` play and pray '' of past crises . 
You play for time , pray that all the money being thrown at the markets and the economy will turn things around , and hope banks make enough profit to heal themselves . 
Or will we turn into another Japan , where banks and the economy were stagnant for a decade ? 
Ask me in a year . 
Meanwhile , an unhappy anniversary to all of us .

Does The Financial Sector Pollute ? 
I liked this point by Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf : A market works well if , and only if , decision-makers confront the consequences of their decisions . 
This is not and probably can not be the case in finance : certainly , people now sit on fortunes earned in activities that have led to unprecedented rescues and the worst recession since the 1930s . 
Given this , the industry has become too big . 
If implicit and explicit guarantees and externalities , including volatility , were fully charged , the sector would surely shrink . 
A number of commentators with the same insight have argued that better regulation is required . 
That 's not Wolf 's solution . 
Rather , he argues that this problem is intrinsic to finance . 
It will not go away . 
You can not grow regulators so wise that they scrutinize it away . 
You can not craft regulations so elegant that they rule it out of existence . 
The financial sector , he says , must simply be smaller . 
How do you manage an inherently problematic sector ? 
`` The answer is : in the same way as any polluting activity . 
One taxes it . '' 
This is usefully radical : The climate change activists propose to tax coal power plants , they 're not doing it so coal power plants become a bit cleaner . 
They 're doing it so we have fewer of the plants . 
I 'm pretty much in agreement with this point , and I 'll just add a graph I rather like . 
This was drawn up by Adam S. Posen and Marc Hinterschweiger and it tracks the rise of derivatives against the rise in actual capital . 
The basic takeaway : Fake money grew a lot faster than real money . 
And as Wolf says , the people who gave us that rapid rise in fake money still , in general , have their fortunes . 
Or at the least , they have a lot more money than the people who became teachers and did n't blow up the world economy . 
The problem is that if you want less `` bad '' finance , you ca n't go in after the fact and separate the good from the bad . 
You have to have less finance in general . 
You have to stop the bad before it happens . 
By Ezra Klein | May 27 , 2009 ; 10:04 AM ET Using notional value is very misleading -LRB- I do n't know whether Ezra is doing this intentionally or unintentionally -RRB- . 
Rather than close out a position a trader would just open a new position on the opposite side of his original contract to net out the profit or loss . 
Though the position would be `` closed '' the notional value would have doubled . 
This issue of `` new money '' supply is actually very interesting in regards to monetary policy but it deserves a serious look , rather than a breezy `` just so '' type story from Ezra to back his political beliefs . 
Klein continues to attempt to delude the less astute . 
If we look at the home speculators as the underlying creators of this , many were stuck with large losses , but they were highly leveraged . 
It is the excessive home buying leverage offered to speculators and the artificially low interest rates they were able to get that are the root causes of this mess . 
Without Fannie\/Freddie buying over leveraged loans , Mortgage interest deductions , and Fed policy this mess does n't happen . 
There is a separate problem of aligning equity speculators with the longer term interests of the firm - and a much higher short term capital gains tax goes a long way to address that . 
You can not craft regulations so elegant that they rule it out of existence . '' 
I do n't know anyone who actually claims this . 
What I 'm reading from this statement is that people will always game whatever system of regulatory rules you come up with , so concentrating on regulation is n't a solution . 
I 'd point out that , for the most part , those calling for regulation do n't disagree about the tendency for the system to get ` gamed ' , but this is n't a point in favor of ` giving up ' . 
The underlying truth of the need for regulation is that there are huge collective action problems for an un-regulated economy . 
Any regulatory scheme created to mitigate these problems will inevitably be circumvented by the adaptive behavior of individuals gaming the system . 
But the prima-facia need for a working regulatory environment combined with adapting individual financial players leads one to conlcude that what is required is a strong and adaptive regulatory environment ... not a captitulation that regulation ca n't work . 
Now this leads me to my next point . 
One of the reasons our efforts at regulatory adaptation have been so bad -LRB- or non-existent -RRB- is the influence of fincancial players on our political system that our campaign finance laws allow . 
So while it may be true that `` You can not craft regulations so elegant that they rule it out of existence . '' 
, it may also be true that such things can not be crafted because they get cut off at the pass . 
Indeed , has the US ever been able to engage in honest-to-god regulatory work under circumstances that do n't have our political leaders undermining it ? 
Another 1\/4 of the needed correction would come from taxing capital gains income the same rate as wages . 
The remaining 1\/12 should be left to enforcing the existing laws aggressively and electing good Presidents .

Politics , politicians , big business and the economy This is What Regulatory Capture Looks Like During the stress tests , an administration official told me that some of the most aggressive pushback was coming from , of all people , career regulators . 
The banks are fine , they said . 
That 's not necessarily surprising : If the career regulators were to admit a systemic problem , they 'd be admitting their own failure . 
Even so , this was apparently a real problem given that the actual work of the stress tests had to be carried out by regulators who were churlish over their very existence . 
Today , Steve Pearlstein gives these intransigent bureaucrats a name and a face : John Dugan , the comptroller of the currency , who thinks big banks are getting a bad rap these days , and has the gall to argue that they should be celebrated because so few of them have failed -LRB- so few of them have failed , of course , because the government has funneled hundreds of billions of dollars into keeping them alive -RRB- . 
This is what regulatory capture looks like . 
For a bit more on how it works , however , I 'd suggest two sources . 
Daniel Hardy , an IMF economist , wrote a paper called '' Regulatory Capture in Banking , '' which has a good overview of the standard literature in the introduction -LRB- the rest of the paper does n't hold up as well -RRB- . 
More interesting is the contribution of William Buiter , a former member of the European Central Bank , who published a long analysis of the '' Lessons from the North Atlantic Financial Crisis '' -LRB- pdf , of course -RRB- , which has a nice discussion of regulatory capture as a function of small-group dynamics beginning on page 36 .

Kudos to the Post for hiring you -- one of the best decisions they 've made recently . 
Bair through her own incompetence was one of the main accelerants of the financial crisis . 
See John Bronte for the explanation . 
"
"Sometime this summer , President Obama will have to start thinking about one of the big decisions of his presidency -- whether to reappoint Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve when his term expires next January . 
What complicates the choice is that the other obvious candidate is Lawrence Summers , the White House economic czar . 
Bernanke has emerged as one of the few heroes of the financial crisis , widely praised for his innovative stewardship of the Fed . 
He 's still something of a sleeper in Washington , so low-key that the frequent descriptions of his `` soft-spoken '' manner do n't do justice to just how quiet he is . 
But in fixing the financial breakdown , he has been a veritable tiger . 
The Bernanke Fed is so much more powerful than its predecessors that it 's almost a different institution . 
Bernanke agreed to sit down for a luncheon interview last week to talk about lessons learned . 
Behind him through the picture window of his private dining room was a majestic view of the Mall , but the Fed chairman was as reserved and fastidious as ever -- even as he described his battle to contain the greatest financial crisis of the past half-century . 
I asked him what message he might leave for his successor to explain what these two tumultuous years have taught him . 
Bernanke offered a surprising answer : For all the computerized financial engineering that preceded the meltdown , he thinks it resembled a classic 19th-century bank panic . 
Investors thought their money was parked in securities that were as safe as bank deposits . 
When these securitized assets proved to be riskier than expected , investors panicked . 
`` We were seeing variants of classic panic behavior , '' Bernanke said , remembering the wild days of 2007 and 2008 , when supposedly safe markets suddenly locked up as frightened investors rushed to get their money out . 
Bernanke recommended studies by Gary Gorton , a Yale economist who has analyzed the ways the recent panic resembled those of the late 19th century . 
In his latest paper , `` Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand , '' Gorton explains that the long-ago panics typically came at the height of the business cycle and involved new information that frightened depositors into withdrawing their money . 
Such bank panics disappeared for nearly 75 years after the enactment of federal deposit insurance in 1934 . 
The panic psychology returned with stunning force in 2007 , when Wall Street suddenly lost confidence in new instruments created by the shadow banking system , such as mortgage-backed securities . 
It 's hard to imagine now , but these exotic instruments were embraced by risk-averse investors such as money-market funds , pension funds and corporate treasuries . 
When that safety proved illusory , people rushed for the exits . 
As Fed chairman , Bernanke scrambled for innovative ways to pump money and confidence back into these markets . 
If one tactic did n't work , he quickly tried another . 
When the panic first hit in August 2007 , Bernanke took the unusual step of sharply cutting the discount rate for lending directly to banks . 
Banks proved wary of using the discount window , so Bernanke created a less-stigmatizing `` Term Auction Facility . '' 
Next came special Fed facilities to bolster money-market funds , the commercial-paper market , mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities -- all with complicated names and strategies . 
But the mission was consistent : to lend into the panic , and to reassure the markets that the Fed was really , truly committed to maintaining liquidity , no matter what . 
Gradually , the panic eased . 
More jury-rigged rescue programs may be on the way . 
Barney Frank , chairman of the House banking committee , is drafting a bill to provide federal insurance for the municipal bond market , which could add hundreds of billions of dollars in new federal obligations . 
The Fed has n't objected , saying this is a fiscal problem for Congress , not a monetary issue . 
A muni bailout would increase the immense debt hanging over the economy and the risk of future inflation . 
The challenge ahead for the Fed is to clean up the debris -- including all the special structures created to contain the crisis . 
Obama will want a Fed chairman who can convince the markets that the central bank will crush inflation , regardless of the short-term pain or the howls from politicians . 
He will need someone who can reverse gears in a hurry and who can say no convincingly . 
Is that person likely to be the quiet radical , Bernanke ; or the outspoken , market-savvy former Treasury secretary , Summers ; or some dark-horse candidate ? 
Each would have strengths and liabilities at a post-crisis Fed , but there 's a strong argument for not changing what , right now , looks like a winning team .

Politics , politicians , big business and the economy Did Bill Clinton Cause the Financial Crisis ? 
I think Bill Clinton makes a persuasive case that it was what he did n't do , rather than what did do , that contributed to the financial crisis . 
There are n't very compelling arguments out there that repealing the Glass-Steagall Act -- the law that separated commercial and investment banking -- contributed much to the crisis . 
Some , in fact , say it did the opposite , as it allowed commercial banks to help stabilize the system by buying investment banks , as happened when J.P. Morgan acquired Bear Stearns . 
But avoiding the regulation of derivatives was a major error . 
And Clinton is pretty honest on that point . 
He thinks Republicans would have stopped him from actually doing anything about derivatives , but that does n't absolve him of the responsibility for at least thinking he should do something about derivatives . 
He does , however , say that his team was pretty convinced derivatives would remain a niche market . 
And there 's reason to believe him . 
I like posting this graph -- I posted it two days ago , in fact -- and it fits well here : There was a massive acceleration in the size of the derivatives market between 2003 and 2008 . 
You 're looking at a 300 percent jump . 
Something , in other words , changed . 
Derivatives became more important to the financial system . 
But it happened after Clinton left office . 
Which makes it hard to say what he would have done if faced with the 2003 derivatives market as opposed to the 1997 derivatives market . 
Clinton swears he was `` queasy '' about derivatives back in the '90s . 
Not queasy enough to do anything about them , but enough to bring them up with Alan Greenspan . 
If the derivatives market had been three or four times larger than it had been in 1997 -- and if it had gotten that way in a matter of years -- maybe Clinton would have gotten downright nauseous and decided something needed to be done . 
It 's hard to say . 
But it 's not something that Clinton , or his critics , can prove or disprove . 
In the mid-to-late '90s , we were barely beginning to connect the dots on the tech bubble . 
The housing bubble was still a decade away .

By Ezra Klein | May 28 , 2009 ; 11:00 AM ET This graphic does n't show at all what happened under Clinton - maybe the market tripled under him too ? 
It did n't do a good job of explaining the mechanics that led to the blowup - just that at some point correlation went to 1 and LTCM started losing hundreds of millions of dollars every day . 
It also made it sound more like LTCM started making too many unhedged and unscientific bets , which undercuts the whole `` even with the best science , you ca n't eliminate risk '' moral of the story . 
This gave real estate a distinct advantage over other capital investments and distorted investment decisions from that time on . 
I 'm sure you could find a graph that would show the beginnings of the housing bubble in 1997 . 
I 'm not blaming the entire crisis on this tax change or on the Clinton Administration but it definitely constituted a significant Governmental puff into the housing bubble . 
Falls : That 's a great point . 
I 'll post it up . 
And yes , government needs to protect the people from the wolves . 
But I am needled by the idea that the bright boys on Wall Street are simply wolves - that they have no morality at all other than greed to govern their behavior - that they absolutely MUST be strictly regulated or their actions will blow us all up . 
The actions of the people who profited most from the riskiest behaviors - the esteemed members of the financial community - are what caused the downfall . 
The bankers made the choice to be driven by greed instead of the best interests of their business . 
So yes , the government failed to step in to prevent a meltdown - yes , the government dismantled Glass-Steagall - yes , yes to all of that . 
But the bankers chose to engage in the actions that took down the economy . 
And they profited nicely as it happened . 
My recollection as a non-economics person is that some of the book 's explications were useful , some were too glossy . 
The book 's main value to me was the revelation of the sheer number of players who are the same people today , doing the same `` jobs '' -LRB- badly -RRB- , looking for the same outcomes . 
Except on a larger scale . 
The prologue , in fact , has Bear Stearns as the key player \* refusing \* to bail out a struggling hedge fund ! 
Took me a couple tries to realize he was talking about LTCM and not Giant Insolvent Commercial Bank . 
Why Clinton could n't remember the name is downright bizarre . 
The Glass-Steagall Act and other Depression-era reforms were written to prohibit the financial schemes that brought upon the Depression . 
Under Reagan and Bush they began to be dismantled , leading first to the Savings and Loan debacle . 
Ignoring this warning sign , the cult of deregulation -LRB- and that 's what it is -- a cult -RRB- kept casting its spells , leading to the overturning of Glass-Steagall ; less than a decade later , we are on the precipice of Depression II . 
And those responsible for this are now in charge of the economy ! 
But what the hay -- Mexico sent 30 mil up here to see that it was signed . 
At first , low paying jobs . 
Who care about the working poor ? 
It must be so because nobody uttered a complaint . 
Then the illegals started pouring in to take the low paying jobs . 
The mantra was `` jobs nobody wanted '' . 
I ask you , how were those jobs handled BEFORE illegals ??? I suppose I have the IQ of a gnat but I actually thought the politicians were in Washington to protect the US citizens . 
Now , we have a Clinton Whitehouse and Obama is only a figurehead -LRB- or is he a beard -RRB- . 
Color me stupid but I actually voted for him . 
Now , in the popular fashion , he is going after Medicare and Medicaid . 
He has done more to bankrupt this country than even Clinton did . 
I thought he was so smart but he has just taken snippets -LRB- unsuccessful ones -RRB- from other Presidents . 
I noticed the part taken from Nixon DID NOT include his price and wage controls . 
Sorry people , he seems to actually want to use inflation to deplete the average person 's savings . 
That 's not change the way us voters envisioned it . 
None of those reasonably can be blamed on President Clinton . 
I guess the headline on the column makes for an eye catcher , but in terms of a realistic claim , NO. . 
The banks and Wall Street decided that they could make a lot of money if they securitized mortgages , passing them off to whomever would buy those securities . 
They had incentive to loan to anyone who walked in the door regardless of qualifications , because they were passing those loans off and they thought real estate would appreciate forever . 
There was no link in the securitization chain that did their job the way the system was designed . 
Mortgagees , appraisers , bankers , rating agencies all failed to act ethically , and the regulators of the Bush administration all looked the other way because everyone was getting rich . 
This was a total breakdown of the system and the watchdogs who were the last line of defense . 
And to top it all off , the CDS market magnified the risk a thousand fold with absolutely no one raising a finger because they were designed to go under the regulatory radar . 
Hopefully the deregulation\/no regulation crowd has learned a lesson , but I doubt it . 
A ` reporter ' thought of a good headline and is using it , with the approval of the Washington Post . 
But there is n't a substantial word or thought in the article ... only sensational suggestion . 
Shame on Mr. Klein , shame on The Washington Post . 
Fannie and Freddie were founded for the express purpose of giving mortgages to people who could not afford a mortgage . 
Democrats pushed the idea hardest , but even Reagan and George W. Bush often repeated it . 
Greenspan 's zero interest rate finally made it possible to write mortgages with no down payment and ridiculous interest rates . 
It simply HAD to happen ! 
Many in the party think he was `` Republican lite '' , and I do as well . 
He did some good things but in the `` modernization financial reform act '' he was under the influences of his Treasury Secretary Rubin and Summer . 
They were too close to Wall St and we are paying for that closeness now . 
However , he did n't create the corruption of the SEC and Bush philosophy was to look the other way when things started to go bad . 
Granddaddy Bush ran Brown Brothers Harriman in NY . 
Averill Harriman 's last wife Pamela put Bill Clinton in power socially in Washington , got rewarded by being Ambassador to France . 
Bush I and Bill Clinton are big pals post-Katrina . 
And someone posted BHO is a puppet if not a beard , well , gee whiz . 
Now Bill Clinton and Bush II are appearing together onstage for around $ 200 a ticket -LRB- but they ca n't sell out -RRB- . 
Gee , there would n't be any long-term heavy financial connection here , would there ? 
LOL Posted by : daddio | May 28 , 2009 7:15 PM | Report abuse Yes , Ezra , let 's `` all '' forget that we had Bush in office for the past EIGHT years . 
Makes sense to blame Clinton , right ? 
But the collective strategy and resources of the American people will save this nation from their foolishness in days to come . 
Although we 've been slapped silly by the notional hand of excess -- we 're at a better place than we were before the derivatives hit the fan . 
We are now required to discipline ourselves back to thrift and innovation . 
Placing blame at this point is pointless . 
What are you going to do to improve the condition of your loved ones and your community in the challenges ahead of us ? 
Carey Rowland , author of Glass half-Full Posted by : carey_glasshalffull | May 28 , 2009 8:45 PM | Report abuse Because , Carey , understanding history , perhaps in this case fault , is supposed to help us in the future . 
And , accpeting your stand would make my thought silly : Overlay onto the chart of the growth of derivatives one showing the rise in use of subprime mortgage lending and the rise in rate of appreciation of residential real estate . 
Perhaps a perfect storm ? 
; `` You 're blaming Clinton too much ! '' 
I agree with jd51 et al that the problem was about how we have handled housing , going back however long . 
As a country , as an extension of the American dream , we have prioritized owning a house over finding a good job , or being able to move to a good job if it opens across the country . 
We made it exceptionally easy through deductions and interest rates and securitization to buy a house and settle down , and excessively difficult due to job-based health insurance and home-closing costs to move into a better situation . 
All that is a big part of why we do n't have as much class mobility as people think , and why the current economic crisis is happening . 
And I think we should appreciate that Ezra is at least somewhat focused on both of these primary problems .

"The article incorrectly described how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is funded . 
The FDIC 's funds come from insurance payments by banks and not from regulatory fees , which could encourage the agency to compete with other regulators for the banks ' business . 
U.S. Weighs Single Agency to Regulate Banking Industry Former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. proposed creating a single banking regulator last spring , reviving an idea that has circulated Washington at intervals . 
-LRB- Joshua Roberts - Bloomberg News -RRB- Senior administration officials are considering the creation of a single agency to regulate the banking industry , replacing a patchwork of agencies that failed to prevent banks from falling into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , sources said . 
The agency would be a key element in the administration 's sweeping overhaul of financial regulation , which officials hope to unveil in coming weeks , including the creation of a new authority to police risks to the financial system as well as a new agency to protect consumers , according to three people familiar with the matter . 
Most of the proposals would require legislation . 
`` The president is committed to signing a regulatory reform package by the end of the year , and officials at the White House and the Treasury Department are continuing work with Congress on the final phases of a proposal , but there is no final proposal in place and any announcement will not be for a couple of weeks , '' said White House deputy spokesman Jennifer R. Psaki . 
Senior officials have reached agreement on aspects of the plan , according to a person familiar with the discussions . 
They favor vesting the Federal Reserve with new powers as a systemic risk regulator , with broad responsibility for detecting threats to the financial system . 
The powers would include oversight of previously unregulated markets , such as the derivatives trade , and of market participants such as hedge funds . 
Officials also favor the creation of a new agency to enforce laws protecting consumers of financial products such as mortgages and credit cards . 
And they want to merge the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which share responsibility for protecting investors from fraud . 
Other aspects of the plan remain under discussion , sources said , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details . 
Among these ideas is the creation of a single agency to regulate banks . 
The new regulator would assume responsibility for the safety and soundness of banks , currently divided among the Fed and three other agencies : the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. . 
The OCC and the OTS would probably disappear , while the Fed and the FDIC would retain other responsibilities . 
Under the current system , banks can choose their regulator . 
Because the OCC , OTS and FDIC are funded by fees from the banks , the regulators have an incentive to compete for business by offering more lenient oversight . 
The system also divides supervision of the largest financial conglomerates among multiple agencies , each with responsibility for certain subsidiaries , creating gaps in coverage that companies have exploited . 
Many experts say these failures of regulation contributed to the financial crisis . 
Officials also are considering giving the FDIC the power to seize large financial firms , such as the parent companies of banks , to prevent their collapse . 
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke both have testified that the financial crisis could have been mitigated if the government had been able to exercise such authority . 
For instance , it could have averted the chaos that followed the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers , officials have said . 
Aspects of the plan could face significant opposition on Capitol Hill and among other regulators .

What Does Ben Bernanke Believe About the Financial Crisis ? 
Ben Bernanke recommends that we read Yale University professor -- and former AIG consultant -- Gary Gorton 's papers for insight into the financial crisis . 
It 's not a bad recommendation . 
Gorton 's latest paper , '' Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand , '' is very good . 
But it contains a lot of sentences like `` If securitization debt is informationally-insensitive , it can be an input into the repo system of creating a kind of transaction medium , i.e. , collateral that can be rehypothecated . '' 
So let 's try to clean this up a bit . 
I should warn you that this post is , by blog standards , a bit long . 
But I can also promise that it 's much , much shorter than Gorton 's paper . 
Gorton 's basic argument is actually pretty elegant . 
`` The period from 1934 , when deposit insurance was enacted , until the current crisis is somewhat special in that there were no systemic banking crises in the U. S , '' he writes . 
`` It is the ` Quiet Period . ' '' 
The Great Recession has been a high-decibel disruption of our happy quiescence . 
The question is : What changed ? 
What did n't change , Gorton says , is the commercial banking sector . 
We did not have a 1929-style bank run . 
Deposit insurance -- the system wherein the government insures deposits of individuals up to $ 250,000 -- worked . 
Individuals did not line up around the block . 
Rather , the entirety of the crisis was in the `` shadow banking sector . '' 
This is where major institutions lend to one another . 
It is a new , and largely unregulated , market . 
But , in certain important ways , it is very similar to the old banking sector . 
And not the banking sector we 've had since 1934 . 
The banking sector we had before 1934 . 
Fixing the shadow banking sector will , for that reason , require the application of principles that fixed the commercial banking sector in the 1930s . 
In other words : We 've done this before . 
The important parallel between the two markets is that both individual depositors plugging $ 1,000 into their bank and institutional investors looking to park $ 12 million want the same thing . 
They want , according to Gorton , `` informationally-insensitive debt . '' 
This is a key concept , so let 's spend a moment on it . 
Imagine you give Apple $ 1,000 for shares in its company . 
The next day , a rumor starts . 
Apple CEO Steve Jobs , it seems , has had his head amputated . 
He might not be back at work for three to five months . 
Your iPhone cries a salty , electronic tear . 
So does your portfolio . 
Apple 's stock plummets . 
Your $ 1,000 is now worth $ 812 . 
The stocks you bought from Apple were informationally-sensitive . 
They were vulnerable to information . 
You could not count on your $ 1,000 to exist come hell or high water . 
Imagine , now , that you deposited that $ 1,000 in the bank instead . 
A week later , the bank becomes insolvent . 
Half its employees immediately commit suicide . 
The other half flee the country . 
This is literally the worst information possible for your deposit . 
But it does n't matter . 
The government -- through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- insures your money . 
Your $ 1,000 is perfectly safe . 
It was , as it turns out , information-insensitive . 
Large investors , Gorton argues , also want informationally-insensitive debt . 
They want to give a bank $ 10 million dollars , have the bank owe them $ 10 million in return and be assured that the $ 10 million is safe . 
But the FDIC does n't ensure deposits that large . 
Hence , the shadow banking market . 
I 'm going to glide by the details a bit , as they 're complex . 
His paper has a fuller explanation . 
But the shadow banking market , according to Gorton , works like this : A mega investor -- the `` depositor '' -- has $ 500 million he wants to deposit . 
Another institution -- the `` bank , '' though it does n't have to be a bank as traditionally composed -- is willing to give the depositor collateral in return . 
The collateral is , in most cases , a senior tranche of securitized loans -LRB- if you want a good explanation of that concept , see this paper -RRB- . 
Those tranches were generally considered informationally-insensitive . 
They were the depositor 's insurance . 
But there is a difference between being informationally-insensitive and being actually riskless . 
An individual 's $ 500 deposit is safe unless the government itself defaults . 
That 's pretty unlikely . 
The senior tranche of a pack of subprime mortgages is safe as long as housing prices keep increasing . 
That , as it turns out , was n't very unlikely at all . 
Which brings us to another key point : `` a ` banking panic ' occurs when ` informationally-insensitive ' debt becomes ` informationally-sensitive ' due to a shock , in this case the shock to subprime mortgage values due to house prices falling . '' 
In other words , a banking panic occurs when deposits stop looking safe . 
That , Gorton argues , is how it happened in the days before deposit insurance , too . 
Then , for some reason , they did n't seem safe because the banks seemed like they might go bust . 
Depositors would panic and run to get their money back before the bank folded in on itself . 
That would create a bank run , which would , in turn , create insolvent banks . 
We ended bank runs in two ways : First , deposit insurance and associated regulations made bank deposits essentially riskless . 
Second , we made bank charters valuable by promoting local monopolies , underpricing deposit insurance and other means . 
Put another way , the 75-year `` quiet period '' was a product of making deposits in commercial banks riskless for individuals and making commercial banks profitable for banks . 
Gorton argues that a similar approach is needed for the shadow banking sector . 
Toward the end of the paper , he offers a `` very broad '' sketch of what it would look like : 1 . 
Senior tranches of securitizations of approved asset classes should be insured by the government . 
The government must supervise and examine banks , i.e. , securitizations , rather than rely on ratings agencies . 
That is , the choices of asset class , portfolio and tranching must be overseen -LRB- by -RRB- examiners . 
Entry into securitization should be limited , and any firm that enters is deemed a ` bank ' and subject to supervision . 
It is , in other words , very much like what we did after 1934 . 
Examining and insuring `` senior tranches of approve assets classes '' -- insuring collateral , in other words -- is rather a lot like what the FDIC does with deposits . 
Limiting access of firms into the shadow market -- which would probably be referred to as the `` institutional market '' or something similarly less-sinister sounding -- is rather like what we do with commercial bank charters . 
This has been a bit of a long post , so I want to remind folks of the lede : I 'm not summarizing this paper because I think it 's interesting . 
I 'm summarizing it because Ben Bernanke is talking it up . 
Yesterday , Felix Salmon wrote a post asking `` what use economic history ? '' 
I do n't know if it 's of any use , but the appeal of Gorton 's analysis to Bernanke might speak to its impact . 
Gorton is essentially making an argument based on economic history . 
Bernanke , of course , was an economic historian for most of his career . 
And according to Bernanke , this is a pretty good summation of how he 's understanding the banking crisis . 
-LRB- Photo credit : Brendan Smialowski -- Bloomberg News Photo -RRB- By Ezra Klein | May 29 , 2009 ; 6:45 AM ET Really great post Ezra . 
The paper is interesting and your summary is a real service . 
I 'm so glad to see you expanding your expertise into the economy in such a disciplined way . 
Keep up the good work . 
If they wanted a riskless asset they would have bought US bonds . 
No they wanted a riskless asset that had the returns greater than a riskless asset . 
No matter you opinion of full information in markets that large of an arbitrage opportunity just is n't there . 
Convincing yourself that there was no risk is the problem . 
It happened to be real estate this time , but securitization could occur on anything . 
That is the current problem , companies want their cake and eat it too . 
That has happened already too many times . 
Have we not yet realized that true captilisim is a great sin ? 
-LRB- Not in religious terms but in moral and ethical terms -RRB- Posted by : 4thFloor | May 29 , 2009 9:28 AM | Report abuse I actually asked Gorton about this : He says that he thinks there simply are n't enough Treasury Bonds to fill this whole market . 
If you look at his table on page 25 , you 'll see that mortgage-related debt and corporate debt have both been bigger than Treasury bonds in recent years . 
So we 'd be talking about doubling or tripling the Treasury bonds in the field . 
I agree that investors turned to the shadow banking market because of higher returns , and , I would hazard to guess , they fell hook , line and sinker to the argument that risk , because of the quants , was a quaint `` old '' notion . 
Hubris , in other words . 
So , not different than the stock market , really . 
Anyone who did not know they were investing into a bubble was blind , and anyone who held on just 1 more day after the bad news started trickling out a long time before the `` crisis '' was greedy . 
I am not sure why investors in the shadow banking market be insulated from their bad decision making . 
Depositing your cash into a bank is something that most citizens MUST do in the current world in order to do anything else -LRB- cable , utilities , credit , mortgage , etc. -RRB- . 
Investing in securitizations , hedge funds , etc. is something that the wealthy and institutional investors CHOOSE to do but not necessary in order to do anything else . 
Mr. Gorton 's seductive analysis is nothing more than `` high school '' economics with the government becoming the insurer of last resort regardless of the actual risk . 
As for Mr. Gorton and Mr. Klein , may I humbly suggest that they revisit their Econ 101 text paying close attention to the critical importance of risk adjusted interest rates as the only realistic method to insure the MOST EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL ! 
If they only wanted the latter , then the individual investors who fund the institutional investors would have desposited in FDIC-insured banks or bought government bonds , as endaround suggests . 
My reading of economic history suggests that part of the reason deposit insurance `` worked '' is that the shadow banking system was able to take up the slack , directing money toward riskier lending in a way that the FDIC-insured banking sector no longer could . 
I worry that if we try to make shadow banking `` safe , '' we risk unraveling both banking systems because it will be harder for riskier investments , which are critically important to the economy , to receive credit . 
A failing in that area of finance could ripple through the rest of the banking system -- unless a shadow shadow banking system emerges to take up the slack . 
FDIC insurance accomplishes two things that are broadly good for society : 1 -RRB- it encourages people to save money while providing capital for investment and 2 -RRB- it prevents bank runs . 
I 'm not so sure that securitization is something that 's worth providing tacit encouragement . 
Besides -- it 's hard to see how this would have changed things too much . 
The asset bubble STILL would have burst , and you 'd have the government on the line for trillions in bad bets -LRB- just like they are now -RRB- . 
Sure the banks and investors would be fine in the short term , but the burden would be just placed more directly on the taxpayer -LRB- though I suppose there 's something more honest about this -RRB- . 
My guess is that he is interested in formally extending the reach of government licensing -LRB- and its counterpart : regulation -RRB- into securitzation , which he is well aware comprises about 50 % of the credit delivery system in the US today . 
He has already taken the Fed there in a big way . 
In my view there are reasons to want to shrink our reliance on securitization and bring it back within the boundaries of regulated banking . 
As compared to old-fashioned banking , which required one-off credit judgments all along the life of a long from inception to repayment , securitization relies on statistical methods to automate lending and servicing . 
In securitization , credit judgments are also skewed toward lending against payment streams -LRB- cash flow -RRB- rather than lending against asset values , whereas old-fashioned banking tended to rely more on asset coverage as a defense against loss . 
Bernanke has not been asking questions about what kind of credit delivery system works best as much as he has been trying to keep the system that has evolved intact and functioning . 
There seems to be no one in Washington thinking hard about this issue , but perhaps I am ill informed . 
My personal policy recommendations would be to make the regulated deposit-taking banks the originators of all loans that are ultimately securitized , so as to have the benefit of old-fashioned underwriting , and to require that loans be seasons on the books of the banks for some initial period before they are sold into the secondary market , and then only rated AAA if the originating bank retains a 20 % equity stake . 
As things stand , in mortgage lending for instance , the program definitions coming from the secondary market prescribe what kinds of loans are available and banks are doing no more than fitting applicants into boxes . 
The information content is being massaged out of the loans . 
Also , it seems to me that deposit insurance has removed information from the market place that would cause banks to be more prudent . 
Without removing deposit insurance , there could be a rating system that would allow consumers to chose to put their money in safer banks rather than riskier ones , and for safer banks perhaps to pay less for deposits . 
I have a crazy idea : why do n't we call it the `` capital markets . '' 
You know , like everyone in the world did for over a century before August 2007 , when the press adopted the sexier-sounding `` shadow banking sector '' name -LRB- at least partly to justify their inexplicable failure to cover the enormously-important capital markets -RRB- . 
But I suspect that the reality left by the end of World War II had more to do with it . 
That period seems to be at an end now . 
There may be good reason to question whether financial manipulations on their own can produce a new quiet one . 
The adjustments to the excesses of that boom period are one problem . 
There is also the problem of adjusting to the end of the 500 year period of European world dominance . 
Then there is the problem of adjusting to one time events in human history like the depletion of energy , global warming , the impact of human generated waste on the planet , and exponential advancements of technology that probably will eventually allow major modifications in the natural curve of a person 's life . 
The exact timing of the unfolding of these trends is of course very uncertain and it is not impossible that there will still be some extended periods of relative stability . 
But it is also not impossible that these trends will all merge together in an extended period of much greater instability than those of us born after World War II are used to . 
The line of reasoning is interesting . 
However , I have a lot of trouble gicing much credence to anything Gary Gorton Says given he spent years working for AIG FP consulting and building models for the credit business . 
His online CV now omits this information , although given it was over a period of 9 or 10 years , I doubt it simply slipped his mind . 
Perhaps Gorton could give us some insight on what went wrong at FP ? 
Your readers need to know that Gortonis helped develop the formula for underwriting CDOs and CDOs squared when he was a paid advisor to the now infamous London AIG office . 
Gorton is largely responsible for the notion of risk-free investment in CDOs -LRB- thanks to the AIG insurance institutional investors purchased -RRB- which is precisely what caused the current bubble and crash . 
If the institutions could n't buy insurance at least the majority , if not the great majority , would have been a lot more cautious . 
Instead of learning from his mistake , he is trying to peddle the same crap to governments . 
There is no hope for finance if anyone still takes Gorton seriously .

"Congress 's Afterthought , Wall Street 's Trillion Dollars Sen. Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- 
authored the 1991 legislation , which was requested by Wall Street . 
-LRB- By Lauren Victoria Burke -- Associated Press -RRB- On the day before Thanksgiving in 1991 , the U.S. Senate voted to vastly expand the emergency powers of the Federal Reserve . 
The critical language was contained in a single , somewhat inscrutable sentence , and the only public explanation was offered during a final debate that began with a reminder that senators had airplanes to catch . 
Yet , in removing a long-standing prohibition on loans that supported financial speculation , the provision effectively allowed the Fed for the first time to lend money to Wall Street during a crisis . 
That authority , which sat unused for more than 16 years , now provides the legal basis for the Fed 's unprecedented efforts to rescue the financial system . 
Since March 2008 , the central bank 's board of governors has invoked its emergency powers at least 19 times : to contain the wreckage of Bear Stearns and ease the fall of American International Group , to preserve Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , to limit losses at Bank of America and Citigroup , to lend more than $ 1 trillion . 
The repeated use of the once-dusty law has surprised and alarmed a wide range of people , including economists and members of Congress . 
It has even raised worries among presidents of the regional banks that make up the Federal Reserve system . 
Many critics are concerned that an institution not accountable to voters is risking vast amounts of public money and choosing which companies get help . 
Others are concerned that the Fed 's new role will interfere with its basic responsibility for regulating economic growth . 
There is also a question about the roots of the crisis : Did investment banks take greater risks in the past two decades because they knew the Fed could rescue them ? 
The 1991 legislation , authored by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- 
, was requested by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms in the wake of the 1987 market crisis , and it would save some of them a generation later . 
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other leaders of the central bank have argued that the emergency authority has allowed it to rescue the financial system and that without it , the economy would be in far worse shape . 
And they argue that they are using the power as Congress intended . 
`` This provision was designed as a last resort to make sure credit flows when times are tough and credit is n't being extended , '' said Scott Alvarez , the Fed 's general counsel . 
`` That 's exactly what it 's being used for today . '' 
Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said that the actions taken by the Fed have been necessary and important but that those actions should have been taken by an agency accountable to voters . 
He said he was not aware of the Fed 's emergency power until September , and he favored removing much of that authority from the Fed once the crisis has passed .

"Bernanke Presses For Fiscal Restraint Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke testifies before the House Budget Committee . 
Bernanke said large deficits threaten financial stability . 
-LRB- By Joshua Roberts -- Bloomberg News -RRB- The nation needs to begin planning now to eventually bring taxes and spending in line , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday , arguing that large budget deficits , if sustained , could deepen the financial crisis and choke off the economy . 
Bernanke 's testimony to Congress reflected growing concern among economists and investors that the nation 's long-term fiscal imbalances could stand in the way of economic recovery by driving up the interest rates that the government , businesses and consumers pay to borrow money . 
The rate the government pays has already risen in recent weeks . 
The Fed chairman argued that even as the government spends massive amounts of money to contain the financial crisis , it must be prepared to move toward fiscal balance . 
`` Congress and the administration face formidable near-term challenges that must be addressed , '' Bernanke told the House Budget Committee . 
But `` unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term , we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth . '' 
The financial crisis is driving the country deeply into the red , with the national debt projected to double from about 41 percent of the economy last year to more than 82 percent by the end of the next decade . 
Thereafter , things will only get worse , budget analysts say , as the baby boom generation lays claim to benefits from Social Security and costly federal health programs . 
So far , President Obama has offered no plan to rein in those costs , though he has stressed the importance of reducing the deficit generally . 
Bernanke frequently delivers messages on the need for fiscal responsibility to congressional budget committees . 
But his comments yesterday carried more weight given recent swings in the market for Treasury bonds . 
In particular , the global investors who finance the nation 's large budget deficits have grown more antsy . 
The U.S. Treasury must now pay 3.5 percent to borrow money for 10 years -- low by historical standards , but up from about 3.1 percent a month ago and 2.9 percent three months ago . 
The increase has come even as the Fed has launched a program to buy up to $ 300 billion in Treasury bonds -- purchases designed to push down rates and did , when the program was rolled out in March . 
The higher rates for government borrowing have many likely causes , and some of those reflect improvement in financial markets . 
For example , as investors have become more comfortable investing in risky assets such as stocks , they have been willing to move money out of safe U.S. Treasury bonds and into other investments . 
But other reasons for the shift are less positive . 
Investors are also worried that Congress and the Obama administration will continue to rely heavily on borrowed money to fund the government and thus are demanding a higher premium to lend it money . 
`` These increases appear to reflect concerns about large federal deficits , '' Bernanke said in his testimony , before naming other causes that are also playing a role . 
Some analysts worry that the Fed will succumb to political pressure in the future to effectively print money to fund government borrowing -- a process known as monetizing the debt . 
Two congressmen raised that possibility explicitly in yesterday 's hearing . 
`` This can be a dangerous policy mix . 
The Treasury is issuing debt . 
And the central bank is buying it , '' said Rep. Paul D. Ryan -LRB- R-Wis . -RRB- . 
`` It gives the alarming impression that the U.S. one day might begin to meet its financial obligations by simply printing money . 
And we all know what happens to a country that chooses to monetize its debt . 
It gets runaway inflation , a gradual erosion of workers ' paychecks and family savings . '' 
Bernanke said that the Fed takes its political independence seriously , and while it is now focused on using all the tools at its disposal to ease the pain of the recession , it will respond aggressively if inflation becomes a problem . 
The Fed has given no strong indication of whether it will expand its purchases of Treasury bonds . 
Without doing so , though , the Fed would have less flexibility to stimulate the economy . 
It has already cut a key interest rate it controls to nearly zero . 
`` They definitely have less leeway '' to buy more Treasury bonds , said Michael Feroli , an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase . 
`` The Fed has n't done a stellar job of communicating its strategy '' with the bond purchases , which , he argued , has allowed the discussion to be dominated by people who argue that the Fed 's actions are effectively monetizing the debt . 
Doing so would increase the money supply , thereby weakening the dollar and leading to high inflation . 
One thing that would help assuage those fears would be for government leaders to signal that they will manage the nation 's finances well in the long run . 
That would tend to keep long-term interest rates low , which in turn would help encourage an economic recovery . 
Bernanke , as is his habit , did not recommend specific ways that Congress should aim to reduce long-term budget deficits ; he views tax and spending decisions as the domain of elected officials . 
`` In the end , the fundamental decision that the Congress , the administration and the American people must confront is how large a share of the nation 's economic resources to devote to federal government programs , including entitlement programs , '' Bernanke said . 
`` Crucially , whatever size of government is chosen , tax rates must ultimately be set at a level sufficient to achieve an appropriate balance of spending and revenues in the long run . ''

"Kenneth Feinberg will set compensation , including retirement packages , of executives at bailed-out firms . 
-LRB- Joshua Roberts - Bloomberg News -RRB- The Obama administration named a `` compensation czar '' yesterday to set salaries and bonuses at some of the biggest firms at the heart of the economic crisis , as part of a broader government campaign to reshape pay practices across corporate America . 
Senior officials said they will install Washington attorney Kenneth R. Feinberg with the power to determine compensation , including retirement packages , of senior executives at seven firms that have received massive federal bailouts , such as Citigroup chief executive Vikram S. Pandit , Bank of America 's Kenneth D. Lewis and Fritz Henderson of General Motors . 
The initiative reflects public uproar over executive compensation , which has been stoked by the financial crisis . 
Lawmakers who approved the government 's $ 700 billion bailout for the financial system last fall worried that taxpayers would end up financing the lavish lifestyles of top Wall Street executives . 
Then , controversy erupted in March when the Obama administration revealed that insurance giant American International Group , a recipient of a $ 180 billion rescue package , had decided to pay $ 165 million in bonuses to its most troubled financial unit . 
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said yesterday that the administration is not interested in `` capping pay '' or `` setting forth precise prescriptions for how companies should set compensation . '' 
Instead , he said , the government wants to rein in pay practices that motivated executives to take excessive risks in pursuit of profit . 
But with the spotlight now on executive pay practices , senior administration officials are moving to address concerns at firms well beyond those implicated in the crisis . 
Yesterday , officials proposed two pieces of legislation that separately empower shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission to exercise more oversight over executive compensation at all publicly traded firms . 
The first measure would give shareholders more say on what companies pay executives . 
Traditionally , stockholders have had limited influence and the authority only to elect a small number of members who sit on a company 's board of directors . 
The second measure would expand the SEC 's power to ensure that the corporate committees responsible for deciding compensation act independently of the top executives whose pay they set . 
Most large corporations have such committees , and their record in rewarding risky management has at times been troubling . 
Conflicts of interest between committee members and executives are common . 
These efforts reflect the administration 's conclusion that companies can not police themselves on matters of pay . 
`` This financial crisis had many significant causes , but executive compensation practices were a contributing factor , '' Geithner said yesterday . 
And more initiatives to address these practices are coming . 
The Federal Reserve is examining how regulators can oversee pay at all banks . 
Geithner and senior White House officials , meanwhile , plan to make executive pay a focus of their efforts to overhaul financial regulation , which officials say will be detailed next week . 
The administration is giving Feinberg authority to influence pay at scores of companies . 
Feinberg , who previously managed the government 's efforts to compensate the families of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks , will control compensation at seven firms that have received large federal bailouts , including Citigroup , Bank of America , American International Group , General Motors , Chrysler as well as Chrysler Financial and GMAC , which provide loans to auto customers . 
He will be able to determine salaries , bonuses and retirement packages for all executive officers and the 100 most highly paid employees at each company . 
He will also have the authority to set overall compensation , but not precise salary levels , for firms that have received smaller bailouts . 
The goal , officials said , is to curb the practice of tying pay to performance in a way that induces traders and executives to take big risks . 
Feinberg can also decide whether executives who have received what he considers excessive compensation should return some of that money . 
For months companies have awaited clarification of the compensation restrictions imposed on recipients of bailout money . 
In February , the administration said it planned to limit salaries to $ 500,000 at banks that have taken `` exceptional assistance . '' 
In addition , any bonuses would have to be paid in stock and could not be cashed in until after the government was repaid . 
Later that month , Sen. Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- 
wrote legislation that trumped those efforts and capped bonuses at one-third of executives ' salaries . 
The new law applied only to firms that took bailout funds after Feb. 11 . 
Dodd 's maneuver upset some Obama officials because his amendment and the administration 's earlier guidance together curbed pay more than the White House intended . 
The officials began to worry that firms would drop out of government rescue programs or lose talented employees . 
As a result , the administration announced yesterday that most firms receiving federal bailouts will face a limit on bonuses but not on salaries . 
For companies that accepted less than $ 500 million , the restriction would apply only to top executives . 
For those receiving more , the limit would also apply to 20 other top earners at each firm . 
The response yesterday from industry and business experts varied widely . 
Some faulted the government for meddling in the private sector while others said the proposed changes were needed but may not prompt real reform . 
Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
, who leads the House Financial Services Committee , said the measures did not go far enough and plans to introduce legislation directing the SEC to outline guidelines for how compensation committees should determine pay . 
Under the Obama plan , members of these committees would not be able to accept fees from their respective firms other than what they make for serving on the panels . 
Attorneys or consultants that help members in their work must be hired by and report to the committee rather than a chief executive . 
Administration officials said they also hoped their efforts would pressure firms to rein in lavish pay by giving shareholders the right to vote on an executive 's overall compensation package . 
This proposal , know as say-on-pay , would be nonbinding . 
Some analysts warned that the vote would n't be taken seriously by companies because it is only advisory . 
About two dozen firms allow say-on-pay , and in no case has a proposed pay package been rejected by shareholders . 
`` Will companies treat this as a compliance exercise they 're being forced to do or will they embrace the process ? 
It 's an open question , '' said Patrick McGurn , a compensation expert at RiskMetrics , which advises big investors . 
`` We hope it goes into the direction of an annual constructive dialogue on pay issues . '' 
The proposal could give could give large investors such as mutual funds , pension funds and labor union retirement funds greater influence in expressing opinions on compensation . 
Administration officials said they hope companies will consult investors in designing pay packages . 
President Obama proposed legislation to advance say-on-pay when he was in the Senate in 2007 , but the bill stalled after facing stiff opposition from the Bush administration and big corporations . 
The Obama administration cited Britain 's say-on-pay legislation , enacted in 2002 , as a model yesterday . 
A Harvard Business School study of the initiative found this year that it failed to curb pay among top executives at companies but succeeded at pressuring companies to scale back severance packages for executives whose companies fared poorly , according to Fabrizio Ferri , the professor who conducted the study .

"Dodd Endorses Creation of Consumer Financial Products Agency Sen. Christopher Dodd -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- 
chairs the panel that would legislate White House plans for a new agency . 
-LRB- By Harry Hamburg -- Associated Press -RRB- Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- 
, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , yesterday announced his support for the creation of a new agency with broad authority to protect consumers of financial products such as mortgage loans and credit cards . 
The Obama administration plans to propose such an agency next week as a key piece of its agenda for the reform of financial regulations . 
Dodd , whose committee will play a crucial role in legislating those reforms , had reserved judgment until now . 
The new office would strip away a major part of the responsibilities of the federal agencies that regulate banks , particularly the Federal Reserve . 
Consumer advocates and many members of Congress have said the Fed 's failure to enforce existing laws was a key cause of the financial crisis because firms could sell products that consumers could not afford . 
For example , the Fed waited until last summer to restrict mortgage-lending practices such as penalizing borrowers for attempting to refinance loans before an interest-rate adjustment and issuing loans without verifying the borrower 's income . 
By then , defaults on millions of loans issued on those terms already were contributing to a meltdown of financial markets . 
`` The economic mess we 're in is rooted in a spectacular failure of consumer protection , '' Dodd said in a statement . 
The statement added that the Fed `` failed for over 14 years to put an end to the predatory mortgage lending practices that led to the financial crisis . '' 
The Fed declined to comment . 
But regulators and industry representatives have quietly started to make the case that a new agency would be even less effective at protecting consumers and that strengthening the role of the existing agencies is a better approach .

"Smoke Clears on Shotgun Merger Rep. Dennis Kucinich -LRB- D-Ohio -RRB- questions Lewis at the committee on Oversight and Government Reform . 
-LRB- By Joshua Roberts -- Bloomberg News -RRB- House Democrats and Republicans yesterday picked through the details of Bank of America 's shotgun merger with Merrill Lynch , a crucial episode in the dueling narratives that the parties increasingly are telling about the government 's role in the financial crisis . 
A House oversight committee had called Bank of America 's chief executive , Kenneth E. Lewis , to testify about his interaction with the government after he threatened to walk away from the purchase of Merrill Lynch . 
The deal , which initially involved no federal assistance , closed only after Bank of America secured $ 20 billion in federal aid and a government guarantee to limit losses on $ 118 billion in toxic assets . 
Over the course of three hours , Republicans on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sought agreement from Lewis that the government had forced him to complete a deal that no longer made sense , while Democrats pressed Lewis to acknowledge he had threatened to leave a major investment bank to a grim fate as a gambit to get public money . 
In the words of committee chairman Edolphus Towns -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- , `` The question is , who was holding the shotgun ? '' 
The different answers offered by the two parties reflect their judgments about what new laws should be written as Congress embarks on overhauling the financial regulatory system . 
`` One of the lessons from this case is that we need much more transparency and accountability in the financial regulatory and oversight process , '' Towns said . 
`` The American taxpayers and corporate shareholders deserve no less . 
They need to know what 's going on . '' 
Rep. Jim Jordan -LRB- R-Ohio -RRB- drew a different moral : That the government had gone too far . 
`` The rule of law restricts the government 's ability to do whatever it wants , '' Jordan said . 
`` We must understand the full story of what happened in the process of the government taking over much of the banking industry so that when the next crisis occurs we can understand the proper limits of government action in a free and civil society . '' 
The hearing focused mostly on a few frantic weeks in December after Bank of America informed the Federal Reserve , its primary regulator , that it might abandon the deal . 
Regulators launched an intensive effort to dissuade the company from what Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke called `` a foolish move '' in an e-mail to subordinates . 
The Fed was concerned that both Merrill Lynch and Bank of America could lose the confidence of investors and collapse , threatening the broader financial system . 
A trove of internal e-mails the committee subpoenaed from the Fed offer a rare look at the deliberations of the secretive agency . 
After Bank of America told Fed regulators it was backing away from the deal because Merrill Lynch 's losses had climbed to unexpected heights , senior Fed officials repeatedly asked why Lewis had been caught by surprise , writing that this reflected poorly on his leadership . 
`` Lewis should have been aware of the problems at ML earlier -LRB- perhaps as early as mid-November -RRB- and not caught by surprise , '' the Fed 's general counsel , Scott Alvarez , wrote Dec. 23 .

A New Spin on the `` Giant Pool of Money '' Theory We 've talked before about the `` giant pool of money '' hypothesis . 
This is the idea that the actual trigger for the financial crisis was that emerging economies were running huge trade surpluses because a series of currency crises had convinced them that they could n't sustain trade deficits . 
All that money , however , needed somewhere to go . 
And it went to developed countries . 
In particular , it went to America , and more specifically than that , to treasuries . 
Problem was , those huge inflows of cash pushed interest rates on Treasurys pretty far down , which made them an abnormally low-performing investment . 
Martin Wolf had a nice graph expressing some of this last week : With Treasury bond yields falling through the floor , there was considerable demand for safe assets with better yields . 
The financial sector , sensing a market opportunity , jumped into the breach with securitized loans and AAA tranches and all the rest . 
Meanwhile , the strangely low interest rates fed a housing and credit bubble . 
In this telling , the key culprit behind the financial crisis was not the doings on Wall Street , but the giant hose of money the rest of the world pointed at us . 
If this is true , then fixing the financial system is like taking medicine to cure your symptoms . 
The disease still exists . 
That , at least , is how I 've understood the argument . 
But I just had a conversation with Steve Pearlstein that 's making me somewhat reconsider the point . 
The causality , he argued , is n't as clear as all that . 
It may be that we developed these exotic financial instruments as a response to the river of money being pumped into our system . 
Or it may go the opposite way : That money was pumped into our system because we concocted abnormally attractive investments that caught the eye of foreign investors . 
This is a slightly different spin on the same argument : In this telling , the current account deficit was still the problem . 
But it grew so large not because of foreign investors but because of Wall Street 's decisions . 
Without the development of seemingly safe , high-return assets , that money would have been left to low-yield treasuries , and because those would n't have delivered sufficient returns , the money would have ended up going elsewhere . 
If that 's true , then it may be that sufficient regulation of the financial sector actually could do quite a bit to ease our current account problems . 
By Ezra Klein | June 15 , 2009 ; 3:11 PM ET Another thing that people have been saying is that the popping of the housing bubble , in and of itself , is enough to explain our current economic predicament . 
But it seems to me that the exotic financial instruments of this decade had a clear role in pumping up the bubble in the first place , as these ` safe ' but relatively high-yielding investments greatly increased the demand for securitized packages of loans , which in turn greatly increased the demand for something whose supply is normally fairly inflexible : homeowners to lend money to . 
I get all that - I heard the This American Life story about the giant pool of money , which I believe aired nearly a year ago - well before Paulson yelled fire in the crowded theater last fall . 
But I ca n't begin to understand how this `` giant pool of money '' persuaded mortgage brokers to lend to anyone who showed up at the table - regardless of ability to pay back the loan . 
I ca n't see how the giant pool forced financial firms to develop `` innovative tools '' that hid the risk of the securitized debt . 
I ca n't logically link this pool of money to the failure of ratings agencies to properly rate the risk of `` innovative '' investments . 
I do n't see how this pool forced people into thinking that terrible risks should be taken with other people 's money `` because everyone else was doing it . '' 
There was money there . 
What people did with it was something they should be held accountable for . 
Much of that is due to inequality . 
Rather than being directed toward concrete projects that would satisfy real human needs , the money went round and round in speculative games . 
Why would anyone invest in , say , renewable energy here , or infrastructure in Africa , or heating equipment for China , when they could make a quick buck on the US housing bubble ? 
The lack of buying power among those with real human needs , combined with the wealthy 's willingness to gamble and trust in financial alchemists -LRB- because they did n't really need the money they were investing -RRB- , were the deadly combination . 
When the haves want to `` get richer more quickly , '' and the have-nots have so little buying power that they ca n't even pay for life-saving drugs they need , why are we surprised that investment degenerates into a speculative game of musical chairs ? 
The core issue is still the fact that work does n't pay adequately . 
The first step in this disaster was the repudiation of the progressive income tax structure under the Reagan administration -LRB- God , I still ca n't believe we elected a stupid , jingoistic B-movie actor as President -RRB- . 
The progressive tax structure was useful in that it made it effectively much cheaper to distribute profits broadly than to concentrate those funds into hundred million dollar comp packages . 
The true core of the disaster happened when American businesses went overseas to circumvent American law for the purpose of exploiting the labor of the world 's poorest people . 
This replacement of well-paid , economically productive jobs with bare subsistence labor eliminated the source of funding for economic demand in America . 
The credit bubble resulted from the desire to maintain economic activity in the face of the ensuing combination of overproduction and diminishing incomes . 
You just ca n't run an economy without funding the demand side of the equation . 
In the presence of the massive demand deficit , we kept the GDP numbers up through borrowing and housing inflation , creating a sham prosperity , an economic time bomb . 
There is no regulation that could have prevented us from exhausting our creditworthiness under those conditions . 
The ONLY fix for this is to make work pay again . 
A revival of demand can come only at the expense of distributing profits more broadly through raising wages . 
In a globally competitive environment , we have to find ways of raising wages globally . 
All aspects of the financial crisis are symptoms of the consequences of inflating profits at the expense of working people . 
Regulatory reform is all very well , but the need to make work pay better is the vital core issue upon which our fate truly rests .

"Making Financial Regulation Work : What Would Have Helped This is part of a series on The Hearing called `` Making Financial Regulation Work . '' 
This guest post is from economist Arnold Kling . 
The financial crisis is often blamed on an atmosphere of deregulation . 
This strikes me as overly vague . 
What were the specific regulatory failures ? 
On close examination , a number of specific issues are not as important as they might appear . 
For example , adjustable-rate mortgages are risky , but adjustments in interest rates caused only a small portion of the problems in the mortgage market . 
Starting in the 1960s , commercial banks and investment banks developed products and services that competed with one another , vitiating the 1930s Glass-Steagall attempt to separate the two types of institutions and culminating in a formal repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 . 
However , it is hard to pin the decline in mortgage lending standards or the surge in leverage at banks on this development . 
Another alleged regulatory failure concerns financial derivatives , and in particular credit default swaps . 
A credit-default swap is an insurance policy on a bond or mortgage security . 
CDS were traded over-the-counter , meaning that individual firms wrote contracts . 
With over-the-counter trading , AIG insurance wrote CDS to insure many mortgage securities , never dreaming that there would be enough mortgage defaults that they would have to pay claims . 
As the mortgage crisis unfolded , AIG 's counterparties worried that AIG had not set aside enough reserves to pay its obligations , demanded that AIG put up short-term securities as collateral . 
These collateral calls were difficult for AIG to meet , and the government stepped in as a backstop . 
During the Clinton administration , there were some who argued that CDS instead should have been traded on an organized exchange , and many policymakers have since come around to this view . 
I am not sure what difference it would have made . 
Had the same transactions taken place on an organized exchange , AIG would have been faced with margin calls from the exchange rather than collateral calls from its counterparties . 
If AIG had not been able to meet these margin calls , the exchange would have taken large losses and probably failed , creating a mess for policymakers . 
Moreover , even if an organized exchange would have done a better job of preventing or handling the AIG fiasco , this was only one part of the overall financial crisis . 
There still would have been catastrophic bank failures due to mortgage defaults . 
I am also skeptical about the claim that we needed a systemic risk regulator to prevent the crisis . 
This would be true if most of the financial damage could not have been prevented by any individual regulator . 
However , the fact is that the Federal Reserve , which regulates most of the nation 's largest banks , had enough power to prevent bank failures with better capital regulations . 
Preventing failure at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae also did not require a systemic risk regulator what was needed was tighter supervision by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , which regulates those institutions . 
That in turn would have required support from Congress , which generally was instead more prone to tampering with the regulator than with the housing enterprises it was supposed to regulate . 
If you could turn back the clock and change regulations to prevent the financial crisis , the focus would be on two areas : mortgage underwriting standards and bank capital regulations . 
The housing bubble , culminating in a crash with severe mortgage defaults , was the trigger of the financial crisis . 
The crisis devastated the banking system because banks had found ways to accumulate tremendous amounts of mortgage credit risk without capital for protection . 
If mortgage underwriting standards had not been dramatically weakened starting in the late 1990s , there would have been much less dangerous housing speculation , less fraud , and fewer poorly qualified borrowers with mortgages . 
But there was nobody in Washington who wanted to see mortgage underwriting standards made more rigorous . 
Tight underwriting standards were not in the interest of home builders , real estate agents , mortgage security traders , or anyone who wanted to see expanded homeownership . 
In fact , there are some who argue that underwriting standards were driven downward because of the Community Reinvestment Act , which puts pressure on banks to lend to minority borrowers , as well as by affordable-housing quotas that were imposed on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae . 
Even if those policies were not major contributors to the decline in mortgage quality , it is fair to say that no regulator who tried to push for tighter mortgage underwriting standards in 2004 or 2005 -LRB- when such a move would have been timely -RRB- would have survived the wrath of Congress . 
In my view , the worst regulatory error was allowing bank capital regulations to be evaded . 
In the late 1980s , after many savings and loans had failed in the United States , international bank regulators developed the Basel capital accord . 
Although this was flawed in many respects , it did represent a formal requirement for banks to hold capital based on risk . 
Most assets required 8 percent capital . 
Some low-risk assets required 4 percent capital , and some government securities required even less . 
Soon after the capital accords were rolled out , banks began to come up with ways to game the system . 
For mortgages , the two most important techniques were securitizing mortgages and creating off-balance-sheet vehicles . 
Securitization allowed banks to get large portions of their mortgage portfolios rated AAA , and these AAA ratings in turn lowered capital requirements , particularly after a revision to the capital requirements that was formalized on Jan. 1 , 2002 . 
The off-balance-sheet entities were an even bigger scam , because generally-accepted accounting principles -LRB- which the regulators copied -RRB- allowed the banks not to count the mortgage securities in these entities as assets at all . 
All of this was done right under the nose of the regulators . 
An article in 2000 in the Journal of Banking and Finance , called Emerging problems with the Basel Capital Accord : Regulatory capital arbitrage and related issues , was written by a Federal Reserve staffer . 
Although such scholarly articles always carry disclaimers that the contents do not represent the opinions of the Fed , it clearly showed an awareness of how banks were using techniques to evade capital requirements . 
The author rationalizes this in part by suggesting that without the ability to evade capital requirements , banks would have been less competitive in the market to finance mortgage loans or other low-risk assets . 
In hindsight , the case for allowing regulatory capital arbitrage to take place was flimsy . 
At the time , a group of market-oriented economists known as the Shadow Regulatory Committee was arguing in the opposite direction . 
The Shadow Regulatory Committee warned specifically that basing capital requirements on credit-rating-agency classifications would lead to distorted rating estimates that would undermine risk controls . 
I do not believe that regulatory capital arbitrage was tolerated out of an ideology of deregulation . 
It appears to have been tolerated because regulators felt that the Basel capital accords were making it too difficult for banks to finance mortgages in their portfolios . 
What seemed at the time to be a small regulatory adjustment turned out to be an enormous error . 
Regulators constantly must make these sort of judgment calls . 
The fact that some seemingly minor mistakes can have catastrophic consequences does not bode well for the view that regulatory reform will be sufficient to prevent another financial crisis . 
Instead , I agree with those who would like somehow to have banks broken into smaller units and subject to market discipline -LRB- through subordinated debt , for example -RRB- , so that regulators are under less pressure to get regulations right or to engage in bailouts when banks fail .

By Terri Rupar | June 15 , 2009 ; 12:12 PM ET -RRB- calls from the exchange rather than -RRB- collateral calls from its counterparties . -RRB- 
If AIG had not been able to meet these -RRB- margin calls , the exchange would have -RRB- taken large losses and probably failed , -RRB- creating a mess for policymakers . 
Could you explain more clearly how an `` exchange '' would have changed the way CDSs were created , tracked , and what would have happened differently than what actually did happen when the `` bottom '' fell out ? 
I submit that the manner in which a realty bubble morphed into a SubPrime Mess , with the connivance of all the components in that chain , effectively substantiates that the above sentiment is wrong-headed . 
There were , in fact , two failures : \* The first was the repeal of Glass-Steagal which reinforced a certain laxity in the federal watchdog agencies , foremost of which was the Fed under Greenspan , with his `` markets are self-regulating '' nonsense . 
-LRB- Five global financial ruptures before our own SubPrime Mess , shows that markets are NOT self-regulating and that national supervisory agencies - with teeth - are a clear necessity . -RRB- 
\* The second was the profits feeding frenzy that induced both Private Finance and Semi-private Finance -LRB- Fannie ; Freddie -RRB- agents to loosen creditworthiness criteria , which spawned the bad loans . 
This happened in the face of TILA -LRB- Truth In Lending Act -RRB- that should have prevented `` teaser loans '' and down-the-line `` balloon payments '' . 
Some federal agency , responsible for supervising TILA , was asleep at the wheel . 
The demise of Glass-Steagal paved the way for the consequences that we know all too well today . 
And , who is paying more the consequence of that inanity ? 
Wall Street or Main Street ? 
Moreover , at about the same time as the demise of Glass-Steagal , here is the suggestion of the American Community Banker 's Association to Congress when that body , in 1998 , was considering reform of TILA : `` Addressing Abusive Practices Must Occur Separately From Streamlining and Simplifying Mortgage Disclosures Abusive lending practices exist and are a threat to both unsophisticated borrowers and the general mortgage lending industry , but any proposed actions directed at curbing and eliminating these abuses must be explored separately from a discussion focused on streamlining and simplifying TILA and RESPA disclosures . '' 
ACB supports and is committed to the simplification and streamlining of the disclosures provided to consumers under TILA and RESPA . 
We will continue to work with other groups , the regulators , and Congress to achieve meaningful reform . 
Education for and understanding by consumers about the mortgage process is in the best interests of all parties . 
We look forward to continuing our discussions with all concerned parties , as well as assisting the subcommittees in any way toward this end . '' 
Yeah , right ... ten years later and how many American families are suffering because of our lack of foresightedness and unfounded trust in BigFinance ? 
Just when are we going to get Financial Regulation right ? 
Meaning this : Any `` financial engineering '' must adhere to EXACTLY the same principle as engineering projects anywhere in the world . 
They must demonstrate clearly that they adhere to `` fail-safe '' guarantees . 
"
"Over the past two years , we have faced the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression . 
The financial system failed to perform its function as a reducer and distributor of risk . 
Instead , it magnified risks , precipitating an economic contraction that has hurt families and businesses around the world . 
We have taken extraordinary measures to help put America on a path to recovery . 
But it is not enough to simply repair the damage . 
The economic pain felt by ordinary Americans is a daily reminder that , even as we labor toward recovery , we must begin today to build the foundation for a stronger and safer system . 
This current financial crisis had many causes . 
It had its roots in the global imbalance in saving and consumption , in the widespread use of poorly understood financial instruments , in shortsightedness and excessive leverage at financial institutions . 
But it was also the product of basic failures in financial supervision and regulation . 
Our framework for financial regulation is riddled with gaps , weaknesses and jurisdictional overlaps , and suffers from an outdated conception of financial risk . 
In recent years , the pace of innovation in the financial sector has outstripped the pace of regulatory modernization , leaving entire markets and market participants largely unregulated . 
That is why , this week -- at the president 's direction , and after months of consultation with Congress , regulators , business and consumer groups , academics and experts -- the administration will put forward a plan to modernize financial regulation and supervision . 
The goal is to create a more stable regulatory regime that is flexible and effective ; that is able to secure the benefits of financial innovation while guarding the system against its own excess . 
In developing its proposals , the administration has focused on five key problems in our existing regulatory regime -- problems that , we believe , played a direct role in producing or magnifying the current crisis . 
First , existing regulation focuses on the safety and soundness of individual institutions but not the stability of the system as a whole . 
As a result , institutions were not required to maintain sufficient capital or liquidity to keep them safe in times of system-wide stress . 
In a world in which the troubles of a few large firms can put the entire system at risk , that approach is insufficient . 
The administration 's proposal will address that problem by raising capital and liquidity requirements for all institutions , with more stringent requirements for the largest and most interconnected firms . 
In addition , all large , interconnected firms whose failure could threaten the stability of the system will be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve , and we will establish a council of regulators with broader coordinating responsibility across the financial system . 
Second , the structure of the financial system has shifted , with dramatic growth in financial activity outside the traditional banking system , such as in the market for asset-backed securities . 
In theory , securitization should serve to reduce credit risk by spreading it more widely . 
But by breaking the direct link between borrowers and lenders , securitization led to an erosion of lending standards , resulting in a market failure that fed the housing boom and deepened the housing bust . 
The administration 's plan will impose robust reporting requirements on the issuers of asset-backed securities ; reduce investors ' and regulators ' reliance on credit-rating agencies ; and , perhaps most significant , require the originator , sponsor or broker of a securitization to retain a financial interest in its performance . 
The plan also calls for harmonizing the regulation of futures and securities , and for more robust safeguards of payment and settlement systems and strong oversight of `` over the counter '' derivatives . 
All derivatives contracts will be subject to regulation , all derivatives dealers subject to supervision , and regulators will be empowered to enforce rules against manipulation and abuse . 
Third , our current regulatory regime does not offer adequate protections to consumers and investors . 
Weak consumer protections against subprime mortgage lending bear significant responsibility for the financial crisis . 
The crisis , in turn , revealed the inadequacy of consumer protections across a wide range of financial products -- from credit cards to annuities . 
Building on the recent measures taken to fight predatory lending and unfair practices in the credit card industry , the administration will offer a stronger framework for consumer and investor protection across the board . 
Fourth , the federal government does not have the tools it needs to contain and manage financial crises . 
Relying on the Federal Reserve 's lending authority to avert the disorderly failure of nonbank financial firms , while essential in this crisis , is not an appropriate or effective solution in the long term . 
To address this problem , we will establish a resolution mechanism that allows for the orderly resolution of any financial holding company whose failure might threaten the stability of the financial system . 
This authority will be available only in extraordinary circumstances , but it will help ensure that the government is no longer forced to choose between bailouts and financial collapse . 
Fifth , and finally , we live in a globalized world , and the actions we take here at home -- no matter how smart and sound -- will have little effect if we fail to raise international standards along with our own . 
We will lead the effort to improve regulation and supervision around the world . 
The discussion here presents only a brief preview of the administration 's forthcoming proposals . 
Some people will say that this is not the time to debate the future of financial regulation , that this debate should wait until the crisis is fully behind us . 
Such critics misunderstand the nature of the challenges we face . 
Like all financial crises , the current crisis is a crisis of confidence and trust . 
Reassuring the American people that our financial system will be better controlled is critical to our economic recovery . 
By restoring the public 's trust in our financial system , the administration 's reforms will allow the financial system to play its most important function : transforming the earnings and savings of workers into the loans that help families buy homes and cars , help parents send kids to college , and help entrepreneurs build their businesses . 
Now is the time to act . 
Timothy Geithner is secretary of the Treasury . 
Lawrence Summers is director of the National Economic Council .

"Obama Blueprint Deepens Federal Role in Markets President Obama is expected to unveil the plan to overhaul the financial regulatory system today . 
-LRB- By Brendan Smialowski -- Bloomberg News -RRB- The Obama administration last night detailed a series of proposals to involve the government more deeply in private markets , from helping to steer borrowers into affordable mortgage loans to imposing new limits on the largest financial companies , in a sweeping effort to curb the kinds of reckless risk-taking that sparked the economic crisis . 
The plan seeks to overhaul the nation 's outdated system of financial regulations . 
Senior officials debated using a bulldozer to clear the way for fundamental reforms but decided instead to build within the shell of the existing system , offering what amounts to an architect 's blueprint for modernizing a creaky old building . 
The White House makes its case for this approach in an 85-page white paper that describes the roots of the crisis . 
Gaps in regulation allowed companies to make loans many borrowers could not afford . 
Funding came from new kinds of investments that were poorly understood by regulators . 
Big firms paid employees massive bonuses , while setting aside little money to absorb potential losses . 
`` While this crisis had many causes , it is clear now that the government could have done more to prevent many of these problems from growing out of control and threatening the stability of our financial system , '' the white paper says . 
The plan is built around five key points , according to a briefing last night by senior administration officials and a copy of the white paper obtained by The Washington Post . 
The proposals would greatly increase the power of the Federal Reserve , creating stronger and more consistent oversight of the largest financial firms . 
It also asks Congress to authorize the government for the first time to dismantle large firms that fall into trouble , avoiding a chaotic collapse that could disrupt the economy . 
Federal oversight would be extended to dark corners of the financial markets , imposing new rules on trading in complex derivatives and securities built from mortgage loans . 
The government would create a new agency to protect consumers of mortgages , credit cards and other financial products . 
And the administration would increase its coordination with other nations to prevent businesses from migrating to less regulated venues . 
President Obama is scheduled to announce the full plan today , ending months of political calibration and internal discussion and dropping the details into an already-heated debate on Capitol Hill . 
Congress is scheduled to hold its first hearings on the proposals tomorrow , and interest groups already are ramping up their campaigns . 
Congressional leaders say they hope to pass some version of the plan by year 's end . 
`` Speed is important , '' Obama said yesterday in an interview aired by CNBC . 
`` We want to do it right . 
We want to do it carefully . 
But we do n't want to tilt at windmills . 
We want to make sure that we 're getting the best possible regulatory framework in place so that we 're not repeating the mistakes of the past . ''

"With BlackRock 's Reach Set to Expand , CEO Defends Money Manager 's Stability Laurence Fink , CEO of BlackRock , left , and Robert Diamond , president of Barclays , held a joint interview in New York . 
BlackRock will be the world 's largest money manager after its planned acquisition of Barclays 's investment arm . 
-LRB- By Andrew Harrer -- Bloomberg News -RRB- NEW YORK , June 16 -- The acquisition of Barclays Global Investors by BlackRock , which has emerged from the financial crisis as a powerhouse and adviser to the U.S. government , creates a giant overseeing $ 2.7 trillion in assets , making it by far the largest money manager in the world . 
To grasp the size of that purchasing power , consider : The Federal Reserve , in its unprecedented effort to rehabilitate the economy , has expanded its balance sheet by $ 1.2 trillion . 
The federal government 's 2010 budget is $ 3.6 trillion . 
The gross domestic product for the United States , the world 's largest economy , was $ 11.7 trillion last year . 
At a time when `` too-big-to-fail '' institutions such as AIG and Citigroup have been injected with billions in taxpayer funds , some analysts are raising questions about the scale of the BlackRock enterprise and its ties to the federal government . 
President Obama is set to propose Wednesday a plan to tighten financial regulation , but largely absent from the debate about regulatory reform has been the role of asset managers , which oversee about $ 21 trillion of assets globally for institutional investors such as pension funds , hedge funds and university endowments . 
In an interview Tuesday , BlackRock 's chairman and chief executive Larry Fink , who started the firm 21 years ago in a modest New York office , said `` $ 2.7 trillion may sound like a lot of money , but the reality is , most of the added money from BGI is in stock and bond index funds . '' 
He disputed the notion that BlackRock could pose a risk to the financial system and the larger economy . 
For one , he said , `` 100 percent '' of BlackRock 's business is managing assets for clients as a fiduciary responsibility , not trading for its bottom line . 
BlackRock also uses minimal leverage -- $ 20 billion , or less than 1 percent , of its $ 2.7 trillion in assets is bought with money lent to clients , Fink said . 
The use of leverage , or debt , in the pursuit of higher profits amplified losses for financial institutions , including firms that no longer exist such as Bear Stearns . 
`` There 's more systemic risk in a hedge fund that has $ 10 billion in assets that 's leveraged 40 to 1 than a BlackRock , '' he said , adding that every entity with more than $ 1 billion in assets should be regulated regardless of whether it is public or private . 
`` For every dollar of equity BlackRock has , we have a dollar of assets . 
That is why it 's not a too-big-to-fail issue , '' Fink said . 
`` What has happened over the past five years , in terms of the tremendous leveraging of certain financial institutions , does not apply to BlackRock . 
You ca n't compare the two . '' 
Responding to concerns that have been raised by some members of Congress about BlackRock 's role in helping the federal government evaluate and manage the rescues of troubled financial institutions , Fink said there was a fire wall between investment management and the part of his firm that performs risk analysis , called BlackRock Solutions . 
`` It so happened that because of the financial crisis , many institutions , public and private , are utilizing that service , '' Fink said . 
That business now analyzes risk for $ 7 trillion of assets and clients include sovereign wealth funds and other governments , he said . 
Indeed , BlackRock and other asset managers are `` not as risky '' as a dealer who writes billions of dollars worth of credit-default swaps and whose collapse could spark a chain reaction of failures , said John Coffee , a law professor at Columbia University . 
But , he added , `` If you were giving common advice to $ 3 trillion worth of funds , you are going to be having an impact that could increase systemic risk . 
There can be systemic risk if one person or entity is able to make a bet-the-farm-investment decision based on poor investment analysis for an extraordinary large amount of capital . ''

One thing to note : The administration made a point of including international cooperation on financial regulation in their early documents . 
But it does n't show up in Obama 's speech here . 
REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT ON 21ST CENTURY FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM THE PRESIDENT : Thank you very much . 
Since taking office , my administration has mounted what I think has to be acknowledged as an extraordinary response to a historic economic crisis . 
But even as we take decisive action to repair the damage to our economy , we 're working hard to build a new foundation for sustained economic growth . 
This will not be easy . 
We know that this recession is not the result of one failure , but of many . 
And many of the toughest challenges we face are the product of a cascade of mistakes and missed opportunities which took place over the course of decades . 
That 's why , as part of this new foundation , we 're seeking to build an energy economy that creates new jobs and new businesses to free us from our dependence on foreign oil . 
We want to foster an education system that instills in each generation the capacity to turn ideas into innovations , and innovations into industries and jobs . 
And as I discussed on Monday at the American Medical Association , we want to reform our health care system so that we can remain healthy and competitive . 
This new foundation also requires strong , vibrant financial markets , operating under transparent , fairly-administered rules of the road that protect America 's consumers and our economy from the devastating breakdown that we 've witnessed in recent years . 
It is an indisputable fact that one of the most significant contributors to our economic downturn was a unraveling of major financial institutions and the lack of adequate regulatory structures to prevent abuse and excess . 
A culture of irresponsibility took root from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street . 
And a regulatory regime basically crafted in the wake of a 20th century economic crisis -- the Great Depression -- was overwhelmed by the speed , scope , and sophistication of a 21st century global economy . 
In recent years , financial innovators , seeking an edge in the marketplace , produced a huge variety of new and complex financial instruments . 
And these products , such as asset-based securities , were designed to spread risk , but unfortunately ended up concentrating risk . 
Loans were sold to banks , banks packaged these loans into securities , investors bought these securities often with little insight into the risks to which they were exposed . 
And it was easy money -- while it lasted . 
But these schemes were built on a pile of sand . 
And as the appetite for these products grew , lenders lowered standards to attract new borrowers . 
Many Americans bought homes and borrowed money without being adequately informed of the terms , and often without accepting the responsibilities . 
Meanwhile , executive compensation -- unmoored from long-term performance or even reality -- rewarded recklessness rather than responsibility . 
And this was n't just the failure of individuals ; this was a failure of the entire system . 
The actions of many firms escaped scrutiny . 
In some cases , the dealings of these institutions were so complex and opaque that few inside or outside these companies understood what was happening . 
Where there were gaps in the rules , regulators lacked the authority to take action . 
Where there were overlaps , regulators lacked accountability for their inaction . 
An absence of oversight engendered systematic , and systemic , abuse . 
Instead of reducing risk , the markets actually magnified risks that were being taken by ordinary families and large firms alike . 
There was far too much debt and not nearly enough capital in the system . 
And a growing economy bred complacency . 
Now , we all know the result : the bursting of a debt-based bubble ; the failure of several of the world 's largest financial institutions ; the sudden decline in available credit ; the deterioration of the economy ; the unprecedented intervention of the federal government to stabilize the financial markets and prevent a wider collapse ; and most importantly , the terrible pain in the lives of ordinary Americans . 
And there are retirees who 've lost much of their life savings , families devastated by job losses , small businesses forced to shut their doors . 
Millions of Americans who 've worked hard and behaved responsibly have seen their life dreams eroded by the irresponsibility of others and by the failure of their government to provide adequate oversight . 
Our entire economy has been undermined by that failure . 
So the question is , what do we do now ? 
We did not choose how this crisis began , but we do have a choice in the legacy this crisis leaves behind . 
So today , my administration is proposing a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system , a transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that followed the Great Depression . 
These proposals reflect intensive consultation with leaders in Congress , including those who are here today : Chairman Dodd and Chairman Frank , who , along with Senator Shelby and Representative Bachus , will be meeting with me throughout this process . 
They met with me earlier this year to jumpstart the discussion of reform . 
These reforms are also drawing on conversations with regulators , including those I met with this morning , as well as consumer advocates and business leaders , academic experts , and the broader public . 
In these efforts , we seek a careful balance . 
I 've always been a strong believer in the power of the free market . 
It has been and will remain the engine of America 's progress -- the source of prosperity that 's unrivaled in history . 
I believe that jobs are best created not by government , but by businesses and entrepreneurs who are willing to take a risk on a good idea . 
I believe that our role is not to disparage wealth , but to expand its reach ; not to stifle the market , but to strengthen its ability to unleash the creativity and innovation that still make this nation the envy of the world . 
That 's our goal -- to restore markets in which we reward hard work and responsibility and innovation , not recklessness and greed ; in which honest , vigorous competition is the system -- in the system is prized , and those who game the system are thwarted . 
With the reforms we 're proposing today , we seek to put in place rules that will allow our markets to promote innovation while discouraging abuse . 
We seek to create a framework in which markets can function freely and fairly , without the fragility in which normal business cycles suddenly bring the risk of financial collapse ; we want a system that works for businesses and consumers . 
There are those who will say that we do not go far enough , that we should have scrapped the system altogether and started all over again . 
I think that would be a mistake . 
Instead , we 've crafted reforms to pinpoint the structural weaknesses that allowed for this crisis and to make sure that these problems are dealt with so that we 're preventing crises in the future . 
There are also those who say that we are going too far . 
But the events of the past few years offer ample testimony for the need to make significant changes . 
The absence of a working regulatory regime over many parts of the financial system -- and over the system as a whole -- led us to near catastrophe . 
We should n't forget that . 
We do n't want to stifle innovation . 
But I 'm convinced that by setting out clear rules of the road and ensuring transparency and fair dealing , we will actually promote a more vibrant market . 
This principle is at the heart of the changes we 're proposing , so let me list them for you . 
First , we 're proposing a set of reforms to require regulators to look not only at the safety and soundness of individual institutions , but also -- for the first time -- at the stability of the financial system as a whole . 
One of the reasons this crisis could take place is that while many agencies and regulators were responsible for overseeing individual financial firms and their subsidiaries , no one was responsible for protecting the whole system from the kinds of risks that tied these firms to one another . 
Regulators were charged with seeing the trees , but not the forest . 
And even then , some firms that posed a so-called `` systemic risk '' were not regulated as strongly as others ; they behaved like banks but chose to be regulated as insurance companies , or investment firms , or other entities that were under less scrutiny . 
As a result , the failure of one firm threatened the viability of many others . 
There was no system in place that was prepared for this kind of outcome . 
And more importantly , no one has been charged with preventing it . 
We were facing one of the largest financial crises in history -- and those responsible for oversight were mostly caught off guard and without the authority needed to address the problem . 
It 's time for that to change . 
I am proposing that the Federal Reserve be granted new authority -- and accountability -- for regulating bank holding companies and other large firms that pose a risk to the entire economy in the event of failure . 
We 'll also raise the standard to which these kinds of firms are held . 
If you can pose a great risk , that means you have a great responsibility . 
We will require these firms to meet stronger capital and liquidity requirements so that they 're more resilient and less likely to fail . 
And even as we place the authority to regulate these large firms in the hands of the Federal Reserve -- so that lines of responsibility and accountability are clear -- we will also create an oversight council to bring together regulators from across markets to coordinate and share information , to identify gaps in regulation , and to tackle issues that do n't fit neatly into an organizational chart . 
We 're going to bring everyone together to take a broader view -- and a longer view -- to solve problems in oversight before they can become crises . 
As part of this effort we 're proposing the creation of what 's called `` resolution authority '' for large and interconnected financial firms so that we 're not only putting in place safeguards to prevent the failure of these firms , but also a set of orderly procedures that will allow us to protect the economy if such a firm does in fact go underwater . 
Think about this : If a bank fails , we have a process through the FDIC that protects depositors and maintains confidence in the banking system . 
This process was created during the Great Depression when the failure of one bank led to runs on other banks , which in turn threatened wider turmoil . 
Yet we do n't have any effective system in place to contain the failure of an AIG , or the largest and most interconnected financial firms in our country . 
And that 's why , when this crisis began , crucial decisions about what would happen to some of the world 's biggest companies -- companies employing tens of thousands of people and holding trillions of dollars in assets -- took place in emergency meetings in the middle of the night . 
And that 's why we 've had to rely on taxpayer dollars . 
We should not be forced to choose between allowing a company to fall into a rapid and chaotic dissolution , or to support the company with taxpayer money . 
That 's an unacceptable choice . 
There 's too much at stake , and we 're going to change it . 
Second , we 're proposing a new and powerful agency charged with just one job : looking out for ordinary consumers . 
And this is essential , for this crisis was not just the result of decisions made by the mightiest of financial firms ; it was also the result of decisions made by ordinary Americans to open credit cards and take out home loans and take on other financial obligations . 
We know that there were many who took out loans they knew they could n't afford , but there were also millions of Americans who signed contracts they did n't always understand offered by lenders who did n't always tell the truth . 
Even today , folks sign up for mortgages or student loans or credit cards and face a bewildering array of incomprehensible options . 
Companies compete not by offering better products , but more complicated ones , with more fine print and more hidden terms . 
So this new agency will change that , building on credit card reforms I signed into law a few weeks ago with the help of many of the members of Congress who are here today . 
This agency will have the power to set standards so that companies compete by offering innovative products that consumers actually want -- and actually understand . 
Consumers will be provided information that is simple , transparent , and accurate . 
You 'll be able to compare products and see what 's best for you . 
The most unfair practices will be banned . 
Those ridiculous contracts with pages of fine print that no one can figure out -- those things will be a thing of the past . 
And enforcement will be the rule , not the exception . 
For example , this agency will be empowered to set new rules for home mortgage lending , so that the bad practices that led to the home mortgage crisis will be stamped out . 
Mortgage brokers will be held to higher standards . 
Exotic mortgages that hide exploding costs will no longer be the norm . 
Home mortgage disclosures will be reasonable , clearly written , and concise . 
And we 're going to level the playing field so that non-banks that offer home loans are held to the same standards as banks that offer similar services , so that lenders are n't competing to lower standards , but rather are competing to meet a higher bar on behalf of consumers . 
The mission of this new agency must also be reflected in the work we do throughout the government . 
There are other agencies , like the Federal Trade Commission , charged with protecting consumers , and we must ensure that those agencies have the resources and the state-of-the-art tools to stop unfair and deceptive practices as well . 
Third , we 're proposing a series of changes designed to promote free and fair markets by closing gaps and overlaps in our regulatory system -- including gaps that exist not just within but between nations . 
We 've seen that structural deficiencies allow some companies to shop for the regulator of their choice -- and others , like hedge funds , to operate outside of the regulatory system altogether . 
We 've seen the development of financial instruments , like many derivatives , that are so complex as to defy efforts to assess their actual value . 
And we 've seen a system that allowed lenders to profit by providing loans to borrowers who would never repay , because the lender offloaded the loan and the consequences to somebody else . 
And that 's why , as part of these reforms , we will dismantle the Office of Thrift Supervision and close loopholes that have allowed important institutions to cherry-pick among banking rules . 
We will offer only one federal banking charter , regulated by a strengthened federal supervisor . 
We 'll raise capital requirements for all depository institutions . 
Hedge fund advisors will be required to register with the SEC . 
We 're also proposing comprehensive regulation of credit default swaps and other derivatives that have threatened the entire financial system . 
And we will require the originator of a loan to retain an economic interest in that loan , so that the lender -- and not just the holder of a security , for example -- has an interest in ensuring that a loan is actually paid back . 
By setting common-sense rules , these kinds of financial instruments can play a constructive , rather than destructive role . 
Over the past two decades , we 've seen time and again , cycles of precipitous booms and busts . 
In each case , millions of people have had their lives profoundly disrupted by developments in the financial system , most severely in our recent crisis . 
These are n't just numbers on a ledger . 
This is a child 's chance to get an education . 
This is a family 's ability to pay their bills or stay in their homes . 
This is the right of our seniors to retire with dignity and security and respect . 
These are American dreams , and we should not accept a system that consistently puts them in danger . 
Financial institutions have an obligation to themselves and to the public to manage risks carefully . 
And as President , I have a responsibility to ensure that our financial system works for the economy as a whole . 
There 's always been a tension between those who place their faith in the invisible hand of the marketplace and those who place more trust in the guiding hand of the government -- and that tension is n't a bad thing . 
It gives rise to healthy debates and creates a dynamism that makes it possible for us to adapt and grow . 
For we know that markets are not an unalloyed force for either good or for ill . 
In many ways , our financial system reflects us . 
In the aggregate of countless independent decisions , we see the potential for creativity -- and the potential for abuse . 
We see the capacity for innovations that make our economy stronger -- and for innovations that exploit our economy 's weaknesses . 
We are called upon to put in place those reforms that allow our best qualities to flourish -- while keeping those worst traits in check . 
We 're called upon to recognize that the free market is the most powerful generative force for our prosperity -- but it is not a free license to ignore the consequences of our actions . 
This is a difficult time for our nation . 
But from this period of challenge , we can once again tap those values and ideals that have allowed us to lead the global economy , and will allow us to lead once again . 
That 's how we 'll help more Americans live their own dreams . 
That 's why these reforms are so important . 
And I look forward to working with leaders in Congress and all of you to see these proposals put to work so that we can overcome this crisis and build a lasting foundation for prosperity . 
Thank you very much , everybody .

"Born in a Previous Crisis , OTS Faces Extinction `` I think the time has probably come , '' said Ellen Seidman , a Democrat who headed the Office of Thrift Supervision from 1997 to 2001 . 
`` I do n't think they did such a great job over the last several years . '' 
-LRB- By Craig Herndon -- The Washington Post -RRB- The last time a president was remaking the financial regulatory system , Lawrence Kaplan and several other attorneys at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board were heading to the rooftop restaurant atop the Hotel Washington . 
It was Aug. 9 , 1989 . 
They watched on television as President George H.W. Bush , nearby in the White House rose garden , signed into law sweeping legislation intended to rectify years of neglect and inept regulation that had contributed to the savings and loans crisis . 
`` It 'll safeguard and stabilize America 's financial system and put in place permanent reforms so these problems will never happen again , '' Bush said that day of the new law , which created three new federal agencies and eliminated two others . 
That afternoon , when the lawyers returned to their offices on 17th Street , Kaplan said , another sign was already on the door . 
`` It said Federal Home Loan Bank Board when we left , '' Kaplan recalled . 
`` When we came back , it said Office of Thrift Supervision . '' 
The agency born that summer afternoon in 1989 to charter and regulate thrifts -- also known as savings and loans -- now faces extinction as the Obama administration presses Congress to roll its responsibilities into a new national banking regulatory agency . 
The news came as little surprise yesterday to veteran OTS employees who have endured repeated calls over the years to dissolve the agency and to policymakers who have long set their sights on abolishing it . 
`` I think the time has probably come , '' said Ellen Seidman , a Democrat who headed the agency from 1997 to 2001 . 
`` I do n't think they did such a great job over the last several years . '' 
As word came yesterday that President Obama had put the agency on the chopping block , staffers at the Washington headquarters reacted with a measure of `` gallows humor , '' said one long-time employee , who was not authorized to speak publicly . 
`` These people have been through this before , '' the employee said . 
`` Not only that . 
They 've lived through the calls for the elimination of OTS '' for `` pretty much all 20 years of OTS 's existence . '' 
But they also realize that this time it could be for real . 
OTS spokesman Bill Ruberry said staffers had sought out supervisors for any details . 
`` Employees are obviously into what 's going to happen and how it affects them and what the future might hold , '' he said . 
`` It 's human nature to wonder how it will all play out . '' 
Acting OTS Director John Bowman has sent out regular e-mails to the entire staff , reminding them that any proposed changes must weather `` a long , deliberative process '' in Congress . 
Even if the OTS does fade away , it likely would n't happen until late this year or early next .

"President Obama introduced his plan to reform financial regulations yesterday as a key to reviving the economy , setting up an intense battle over the particulars that is likely to rage on Capitol Hill for the rest of the year . 
Legislators , regulators and advocates all welcomed the idea of change , but industry groups already are arguing that elements of the plan will hurt consumers or the broader economy , not to mention financial firms . 
Opposition is piling up with particular speed against the idea of a new agency with broad powers to protect borrowers and other customers of financial firms , setting up a high-stakes contest between the industry and the White House for the loyalty of a few moderate senators who increasingly hold the balance of power . 
The president used his bully pulpit yesterday to argue that the government must intervene against a `` culture of irresponsibility '' that encompasses banks and borrowers , becoming more involved in the markets to create a basis for sustainable growth . 
In addition to a consumer protection agency , he proposed new powers for the Federal Reserve to regulate large firms and critical markets , and urged a series of smaller federal interventions . 
`` Millions of Americans who have worked hard and behaved responsibly have seen their life dreams eroded by the irresponsibility of others and the failure of their government to provide adequate oversight , '' Obama said . 
`` Our entire economy has been undermined by that failure . '' 
The administration 's plan , presented in an 85-page `` white paper '' with a green cover , is the product of months of debate with a wide range of legislators , experts and interest groups . 
Senior officials tried to assess the causes of the crisis , consider the best policy responses and then push those ideas through the filter of political viability . 
The result is a sweeping plan that combines a few overarching proposals with dozens of small tweaks to the system . 
Implementing the entire plan would require scores of separate actions , including new laws , rewritten rules and international coordination . 
The two congressmen most responsible for the next stage in the process walked side-by-side from the White House yesterday afternoon , carrying the debate to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and vowing to return with a final bill by the end of the year . 
Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- 
and Sen. Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- 
, whose committees will hammer out most of the details , were invited by the White House to sit alongside the president 's senior advisers during the speech . 
Afterward they expressed broad agreement with the principles but said that many of the specific proposals needed to discussed and modified , and that some were unlikely to survive . 
Still , Frank said as Dodd nodded , `` This will be on the president 's desk before we adjourn for the year . '' 
The president 's speech came on the same day that several large financial firms repaid federal aid , underscoring the administration 's transition from fighting a financial crisis to addressing its causes . 
Nine banks said yesterday that they had repaid a total of $ 66 billion , including J.P. Morgan Chase , which wired the government $ 25 billion , and Capital One Financial of McLean , which repaid $ 3.6 billion . 
Regulators had approved the repayments last week after concluding that the strongest large banks no longer needed the aid .

"Another Day , a Weaker Dollar The financial crisis has intensified the debate over whether the dollar should remain the world 's dominant currency . 
-LRB- By Mark Wilson -- Getty Images -RRB- The days of calling the dollar almighty may be numbered . 
Since World War II , when the dollar eclipsed the British pound as the king of world currencies , the United States has reaped the rewards of its monetary strength . 
The greenback 's sense of indestructibility allowed the U.S. government to borrow cheaply and gave rise to an era of rich American globetrotters toting the world 's most easily convertible form of cash . 
But the financial crisis that started in the United States is dramatically intensifying the debate over the future of the dollar , and whether it can , or should , remain at the top of the financial food chain . 
Although a meaningful shift away from the dollar is likely to take years or more , some analysts believe that the debate is now reaching a tipping point . 
Last week , the leaders of Brazil , Russia , India and China -- whose governments are some of the world 's largest dollar holders -- jointly declared the need for a `` more diversified international monetary system , '' sparking a drop in the greenback on world markets . 
In recent months , China in particular has led a campaign for a new world monetary order , arguing that the financial crisis has exposed profound vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy and financial system . 
Those flaws , critics argue , show it is simply too risky for the world 's central banks to rely largely on the dollar for their global reserves . 
At the same time , Beijing has taken unprecedented steps to increase the international role of its own currency , the yuan , to a level commensurate with China 's relatively new status as a major economic power . 
In the coming weeks , the International Monetary Fund -- the institution charged with the monitoring and stability of the global economy -- will issue a vast amount of currency-like assets known as Special Drawing Rights , which some analysts see as a long-term substitute for the hordes of dollar reserves being held by central banks around the world . 
Some now envision that the dollar will fall from its recent levels of 60 to 65 percent of international reserves to less than 50 percent a decade from now . 
A diminishing of the dollar 's global role has far-reaching implications for the United States . 
The value of the dollar versus other major currencies could markedly drop as it slips from supremacy , making millions of Americans overseas feel poorer while potentially fueling a new golden era for U.S. exporters as American goods become more cost-competitive . 
The U.S. government may also be forced to pay higher rates to investors when selling , for instance , Treasury bonds to raise cash -- making it far more costly in the future to cover the kind of massive stimulus spending the government is now undertaking . 
`` The dollar 's global status has allowed the U.S. to have a free pass on financing our deficit as opposed to countries like Brazil , who are punished by international currency investors for risky behavior , '' said Martin Weiss , author of the `` Ultimate Depression Survival Guide . '' 
`` But if the dollar is no longer the currency everybody wants or must have to continue doing business , that is going to be much , much harder to do . '' 
Despite the current campaign to lessen the dollar 's role , analysts note that there has not yet been a major push by foreign governments or private investors to shed it . 
In fact , over the course of the financial crisis , the dollar -- which had been on a downward trajectory for months -- has actually strengthened against major currencies , including its closest rival , the euro . 
That is partly because even nations like China -- with the world 's largest dollar-denominated reserves , at close to $ 2 trillion worth -- have shied away from dumping the dollar , fearing it could trigger a global run that would severely damage the value of their holdings . 
Additionally , other mighty currencies like the euro have lost their chance to claim the dollar 's crown because their issuing nations are in even worse economic shape than the United States . 
In times of crisis , the dollar , as well as dollar-denominated U.S. Treasury bonds , are still seen as safe havens . 
`` The U.S. had to screw something up to lose the dominance of the dollar , and you could argue that the U.S. starting a global financial crisis is a pretty big screw-up , '' said C. Fred Bergsten , director of the Peterson Institute of International Economics and a top economic official during the Carter administration . 
`` But the Europeans have n't been able to take advantage of that to advance the euro immediately , largely because they 've made some pretty big screw-ups themselves . '' 
That said , economists including Bergsten are now saying the end of the dollar 's dominance appears increasingly inevitable . 
During the 19th and early 20th centuries , for instance , the British pound enjoyed a similar supremacy . 
It gradually lost that role as Britain 's empire crumbled , was devastated by two world wars and saw the United States emerge as the world 's dominant superpower . 
By the same token , economists see the current financial crisis , and the doubts it has raised about the U.S. economy , as accelerating the creation of a new economic order . 
The easy monetary policy embraced by the Federal Reserve to spark a recovery -- including zero-interest rates and the printing of cash to support stimulus spending -- is also working against the strength of the dollar .

"NEW YORK , June 24 -- The greatest fear among hedge fund managers and executives , who have seen their industry shrink in the financial crisis , is neither the flight of wealthy investors nor ill-functioning markets but regulation , according to a survey to be released Wednesday . 
Among respondents , 38 percent said that `` onerous government regulation '' was the biggest threat to the industry , reflecting their anxiety over Washington 's heightened attention to hedge funds and other Wall Street firms involved in the financial crisis . 
Lack of willing investors was a distant second , with 16 percent . 
Other factors , such as a lack of access to capital and a lack of market transparency , received single-digit percentages . 
While 43 percent said there is the `` right amount '' of regulation now , 37 percent said they favored more regulation , according to the survey , which was commissioned by RSM McGladrey , a financial services consultancy . 
Eighteen percent favored looser oversight . 
This was the first time the survey was conducted . 
`` Do I think there should be more regulation than there was a year ago ? 
Do I fear it 's going to be too much ? 
Yes , '' Rob Topping of Topping Capital , a Chicago fund manager with about $ 110 million in assets under management , said in an interview . 
`` What you do n't want to do is run the risk of killing the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country great . '' 
Other fund managers , however , said regulation was not a concern . 
`` The greatest threat is not from Washington . 
The greatest threat is from a malfunctioning economy , '' Leon Cooperman , co-founder of Omega Advisors , a $ 4 billion hedge fund , said in an interview . 
Under an Obama administration plan for overhauling financial regulations , hedge funds whose managed assets exceed a `` modest '' threshold would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission . 
They would also be required to report information that regulators could use to assess risk to the financial system . 
While trade groups representing hedge funds say they agree with the broad concepts , the industry is engaged in discussions with Washington over what type of information should be supplied and which funds would be subject to the requirements , officials said . 
The industry is also worried that regulators could deem particular hedge funds so large or so linked to the broader financial system that they would face additional capital requirements and reporting mandates . 
The survey of 102 hedge fund managers and executives -- conducted from May 20 to June 4 and reporting a margin of error of 9.7 percent -- also asked them to rate the performance of regulatory agencies . 
The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had the best reviews , both garnering 78 percent approval rates . 
The Treasury Department was next , with 61 percent approving of its job . 
The Securities and Exchange Commission , under fire for its failure to prevent the implosion of Bear Stearns and Lehman Bothers as well as the multibillion-dollar Bernard Madoff fraud , fared the worst , receiving a 26 percent approval rating .

General Electric , the world 's largest industrial company , has quietly become the biggest beneficiary of one of the government 's key rescue programs for banks . 
The company did not initially qualify for the program , under which the government sought to unfreeze credit markets by guaranteeing debt sold by banking firms . 
But regulators soon loosened the eligibility requirements , in part because of behind-the-scenes appeals from GE . 
As a result , GE has joined major banks collectively saving billions of dollars by raising money for their operations at lower interest rates . 
Public records show that GE Capital , the company 's massive financing arm , has issued nearly a quarter of the $ 340 billion in debt backed by the program , which is known as the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program , or TLGP . 
The government 's actions have been `` powerful and helpful '' to the company , GE chief executive Jeffrey Immelt acknowledged in December . 
GE 's finance arm is not classified as a bank . 
Rather , it worked its way into the rescue program by owning two relatively small Utah banking institutions , illustrating how the loopholes in the U.S. regulatory system are manifest in the government 's historic intervention in the financial crisis . 
The Obama administration now wants to close such loopholes as it works to overhaul the financial system . 
The plan would reaffirm and strengthen the wall between banking and commerce , forcing companies like GE to essentially choose one or the other . 
`` We 'd like to regulate companies according to what they do , rather than what they call themselves or how they charter themselves , '' said Andrew Williams , a Treasury spokesman . 
GE 's ability to live in the best of both worlds -- capitalizing on the federal safety net while avoiding more rigorous regulation -- existed well before last year 's crisis , because of its unusual corporate structure . 
Banking companies are regulated by the Federal Reserve and not allowed to engage in commerce , but federal law has allowed a small number of commercial companies to engage in banking under the lighter hand of the Office of Thrift Supervision . 
GE falls in the latter group because of its ownership of a Utah savings and loan . 
Unlike other major lenders participating in the debt guarantee program , including Bank of America , Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase , GE has never been subject to the Fed 's stress tests or its rules for limiting risk . 
Also unlike firms that have received bailout money in the Troubled Assets Relief Program , or TARP , GE is not subject to restrictions such as limits on executive compensation . 
The debt guarantee program that GE joined is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which was reluctant to take on the new mission , according to current and former officials who were not authorized to speak publicly . 
The FDIC also initially resisted expanding the pool of eligible companies , fearing it would add more risk to the program , the officials said . 
Despite those misgivings , there have been no defaults in the loan guarantee program . 
It has helped buoy confidence in the credit markets and enabled vital financial firms to raise cash even during the darkest days of the economic crisis . 
In addition , the program has raised more than $ 8 billion in fees .
