2009-03-02,"By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Mon Mar 2 , 2009 4:23 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Virtually all cases of the most common strain of flu circulating in the United States now resist the main drug used to treat it , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Monday . 
CDC researchers said 98 percent of all flu samples from the H1N1 strain were resistant to Roche AG 's Tamiflu , a pill that can both treat flu and prevent infection . 
Four patients infected with the resistant strain have died , including two children . 
This year , H1N1 is the most common strain of flu in the United States , although the flu season is a mild one so far , and still below the levels considered an epidemic . 
Few doctors even test patients for flu , and Tamiflu is not widely prescribed . 
But the news is sobering because the pill , known generically as oseltamivir , is one of the few weapons against influenza , which kills an estimated 36,000 people in the United States in an average year . 
It is also considered a key weapon against a potential pandemic of a new type of influenza , and this study suggests the virus can rapidly evade its effects . 
This season , nine children have died from influenza , most apparently healthy before they got infected , the CDC reports . 
Last flu season , only 19 percent of H1N1 viruses tested were Tamiflu-resistant , Dr. Nila Dharan and colleagues at the CDC reported . 
`` As of February 19 , 2009 , resistance to oseltamivir had been identified among 264 of 268 -LRB- 98.5 percent -RRB- U.S. influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- viruses tested , '' the researchers wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association . 
They interviewed 99 patients and found 30 percent of them had been vaccinated against flu but became infected anyway . 
The vaccine is known not to fully protect against infection . 
`` Two patients died on the way to the hospital or in the emergency department . 
One patient was 4 years old and previously healthy , and one patient was 4 years old with neurological problems , '' Dharan 's team wrote . 
Dr. David Weinstock of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Dr. Gianna Zuccotti of Brigham and Women 's Hospital , both in Boston , said the quick spread of Tamiflu-resistant flu had surprised doctors . 
`` Undoubtedly , new surprises await in the perpetual struggle with influenza as one thing is certain -- the organism will continue to evolve , '' they wrote . 
`` For now , the best tools to mitigate influenza infection are tried-and-true -- vaccination , social distancing , hand washing , and common sense . '' 
GlaxoSmithKline , which makes the rival flu drug Relenza , said there was no indication influenza viruses were resistant to its drug . 
Relenza , known generically as zanamivir , is inhaled and is used even less commonly than Tamiflu . 
Flu already resists two older drugs , rimantadine and amantadine . 
There is no indication the two other types of season flu now circulating , H3N2 and influenza B , resist the effects of Tamiflu and the CDC recommends using a cocktail of flu drugs in patients now . 
`` Hundreds of thousands of flu patients continue to be treated with Tamiflu this season , '' Roche said in a statement . 
`` Treatment with antivirals such as Tamiflu can lessen the duration and severity of illness and can help curb the spread of flu , especially in crowded settings like households , schools and nursing homes . ''

2009-03-16,"Now that President Asif Ali Zardari has agreed to r einstate Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and offered to challenge a court decision against his rival Nawaz Sharif , is he going to come under pressure to give up his powers to dismiss parliament , another popular demand ? 
For many Pakistanis , that is the next stage in the rapid emasculation of Zardari 's presidency . 
Article 58-2B of the constitution , which many blame for much of the country 's political instability , has several times been used to sack elected governments . 
Zardari had promised to ditch it but has yet to deliver . 
`` The next thing is to throw -LRB- out -RRB- 58-2B -- it will fix the super power of president then , '' was a post on microblogging site Twitter where activists , lawyers and ordinary people , caught up in the drama of the moment , shared information and pictures in real time . 
He has already lost his Information Minister . 
Sherry Rehman , a long-time confidante of his late wife Benazir Bhutto , abruptly quit after the government temporarily blocked transmission of the popular GEO news television channel . 
Two years after Iftikhar Chaudhry was first sacked by then President Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan government officials said he would be reinstated as Chief Justice after a nationwide protest led by Pakistan 's lawyers . 
It 's been a rollercoaster ride . 
After he was removed by Musharraf , Chaudhry was reinstated only to be sacked again and placed under house arrest along with many other lawyers when the former general declared emergency rule in November 2007 . 
At the time , Pakistani lawyer\/politician Aitzaz Ahsan wrote in an editorial in the New York Times that the leaders of the lawyers movement '' will neither be silent nor still '' . 
But he also fretted that the lawyers ' movement would be ignored by the United States and overlooked by the forthcoming election . 
`` Turban-topped , gun-totting mountain men , stern military dictators and corrupt civilian politicians dominate the global media s representations of Pakistan , from Washington to New Delhi best fitting the preferred image of the most dangerous place on earth , '' he said . 
Pakistani authorities banned public protests and detained hundreds of lawyers and opposition workers nationwide to prevent them from launching Thursday 's planned '' long march '' towards the capital Islamabad to force President Asif Ali Zardari to reinstate a former Supreme Court judge . 
Many went into hiding according to these reports , vowing to press on with the cross-country motor convoy that will set off from cities in Baluchistan and Sind and then Puinjab on Friday before culminating outside the parliament building in the capital . 
Maybe this always happens at times of national upheaval . 
But there is a surprising disconnect between the immediacy of the crisis facing Pakistan as expressed by Pakistani bloggers and the more slow-moving debate taking place in the outside world over the right strategy to adopt towards both Pakistan and Afghanistan . 
Reading Pakistani blogs since confrontation between the country 's two main political parties exploded and comparing them to international commentaries is a bit like watching men shout that their house is on fire , and then panning over to the fire station where the folks in charge are debating which type of water hose works best . 
Former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has been cited as an outside candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize . 
The recipient of this year 's prize will be announced in Oslo on Oct. 10 from among 197 nominees , with those fighting for human rights among those tipped to win in the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
With hindsight , it seems clear that a mass movement named after Mao 's Long March but also claiming Gandhi 's principles of non-violence risked disappointing its supporters . 
The failure of the Long March by Pakistan 's lawyers to restore judges sacked by President Pervez Musharraf , and its dispersal last Saturday , has prompted much debate about why its leaders gave up without at least staging a sit-in . 
Defense analyst Ikram Sehgal called the Long March a logistical success in its ability to garner mass support without violence , but a tactical failure . 
`` The tactical failure of this long-lasting tremendous effort founded on great principles has become a strategic disaster for Musharraf 's opponents , '' he writes in The News . 
`` About Pervez Musharraf , ` with such friends who needs enemies ' , one can paraphrase the saying for him : ` With such enemies why does he need friends ?

2009-03-30,"Starting this blog was a costly decision . 
To be precise , $ 359 . 
That 's how much I paid Amazon last night when I ordered a Kindle electronic book reader to kick off my plan to document the impact of digital media . 
The Kindle is the missing piece in my digital life . 
I bought my first digital camera in 2000 . 
I ca n't remember the last time I purchase a CD . 
And since moving to the United States in September , I 've largely given up DVDs in favor of videos streamed via broadband . 
My life is largely free of the clutter of silver discs and boxes of photos . 
The Kindle and devices like it promise to do the same for printed media . 
But do I really want to give up books ? 
As appealing as I find Amazon 's promise that I can carry 1,500 tomes in a device as thin as a magazine , is a house without shelves of wrinkled book spines really a home ? 
And how can I share sections of the Sunday New York Times with my wife when I swap our print subscription for the Kindle version ? 
In the coming year , I 'll be exploring the cultural and business implications of the accelerating shift towards digital media . 
The forces that are reshaping the music industry and newspaper publishers are rippling to television and beyond . 
New social trends and corporate champions will emerge , just as Apple and the iPod changed the way we consume music . 
Names such as Roku and Boxee are challenging the relevance of the Blu-Ray DVD players that the big electronics makers want us to buy . 
Many of these trends are well underway in the United States and I 'll chart them through my personal experiences with the Kindle and other gadgets . 
With the help of my colleagues around the world and , I hope , our readers , I 'll also look at how they are taking root elsewhere . 
Your digital comments are welcome .

Photograph : Susana Gonzalez\/Reuters Pageant officials are calling the post by the beauty queen , Dayana Mendoza from Venezuela , a misunderstanding . 
During a tour of the dentention center with Miss USA , Crystle Stewart , Mendoza wrote that the facility was `` a loooot of fun '' and the prison had an `` unbelievable '' beach in the bay . 
`` We visited the detainees ' camps and we saw the jails , where they shower , how the -LRB- y -RRB- recreate themselves with movies , classes of art , books . 
It was very interesting , '' she said . 
A statement from the president of the Miss Universe organization , Paula Shugart , has replaced the posting . 
Shugart wrote that Mendoza was referring to `` the hospitality she received while meeting the members of the US military and their families '' . 
Greg Gutfeld , host of the Fox News program Red Eye , has apologised to Canada for comments that were made about the country 's military during a show on 17 March . 
On one segment of the show , a panel talked about Canadian lieutenant general Andrew Leslie 's assertion that the military would need a one-year break from fighting in Afghanistan after Canada 's commitment ends in 2011 . 
Gutfield laughed at Leslie 's suggestion saying : `` The Canadian military wants to take a breather to do some yoga , paint landscapes , run on the beach in gorgeous white capri pants . '' 
`` Is n't this the perfect time to invade this ridiculous country ? 
They have no army , '' he added . 
Canada 's defense minister Peter MacKay demanded an apology from the presenter before attending a repatriation ceremony for Canadian troops who were killed in Afghanistan last Friday . 
In a statement issued to Fox News today , Gutfeld said his comments `` may have been misunderstood '' and that he did n't intend to disrespect `` the brave men , women and families of the Canadian military '' . 
116 Canadian soldiers have died in Afghanistan . 
On Monday , Venezuela 's president Hugo Ch vez announced halting a program that provided free heating oil to low-income US citizens . 
The leftist leader had reportedly heralded the initiative as a clear sign of his generosity toward America 's poor . 
However , the recent steep drop in the price of oil , Venezuela 's chief export , forced the nation 's government to cut spending and the program was scrapped in the process . 
But yesterday , Ch vez backtracked and announced that the program was reinstated . 
And of course , such a quick reversal did not come without criticism .

2009-04-15,"HONG KONG | Wed Apr 15 , 2009 5:56 am EDT HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Scientists in Hong Kong and the United States have identified a synthetic compound which appears to be able to stop the replication of influenza viruses , including the H5N1 bird flu virus . 
The search for such new `` inhibitors '' has grown more urgent in recent years as drugs , like oseltamivir , have become largely ineffective against certain flu strains , like the H1N1 seasonal flu virus . 
Experts now question how well and how long the drug would stand up against the H5N1 , should it unleash a pandemic . 
Researchers in Hong Kong and the Unites States screened some 230,000 compounds that were catalogued with the U.S. National Cancer Institute , and found 20 that could potentially restrict the proliferation of the H5N1 . 
The experts told a news conference on Wednesday one of the compounds , compound 1 or NSC89853 , showed promise . 
`` We have found a compound that is different from oseltamivir but which acts in the same way , '' said Leo Poon , a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong . 
`` An analogy would be like we have a door with a keyhole , but the hole has changed , and the key , in this case oseltamivir , ca n't lock the door anymore , '' he told the news conference . 
`` But we have discovered another keyhole and another key which can lock the door . '' 
Their finding was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry . 
In their experiment , the researchers infected separate batches of cultured human cells with seasonal flu virus and H5N1 and found that compound 1 prevented the replication of both types of viruses effectively . 
`` Given the problems with drug resistance , this compound can be used to develop a new drug , '' said Allan Lau , professor of pediatrics and adolescent medicine at the University of Hong Kong . 
But he cautioned it would take as much as eight years for such a drug to be available on the market . 
Many advanced countries stock up on oseltamivir and zanamivir , two varieties of the same class of drugs that stops the H5N1 virus from multiplying . 
But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in March that 98 percent of all flu samples from the H1N1 strain were resistant to oseltamivir , which is manufactured by Roche AG and marketed under the brand Tamiflu . 
Viruses and bacteria are sturdy organisms that fight hard to survive and adapt swiftly to drugs that are used to kill them , quickly becoming resistant to them .

2009-04-21,"By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Tue Apr 21 , 2009 10:19 pm BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A new type of swine flu has infected at least two children in California and while both have recovered , U.S. health officials said on Tuesday they were looking for more cases . 
They say it is possible the children were infected by other people and not by pigs , and said they have consulted with officials in Canada , Mexico and at the World Health Organization although there is no evidence that the new virus is circulating widely . 
In a special alert , the CDC asked doctors in California 's San Diego and Imperial counties , on the border with Mexico , to test anyone with flu-like symptoms and send the samples in for testing . 
`` Both of these kids came to our attention because they were seen in clinics which do routine surveillance for influenza infections , '' the CDC 's Dr. Lyn Finelli told reporters in a telephone briefing . 
Neither child , a 10-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl , had especially severe symptoms , although the girl had had a fever of 104 degrees , Finelli said . 
`` We are not making the assumption that there are widespread infections out there and there is not any action that the public should take right now , '' Finelli said . 
The influenza strain is an H1N1 , the same family as one of the seasonal flu viruses now circulating . 
But it genetically resembles a virus found in pigs and not in people , officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . 
It has never been seen before , the CDC said . 
`` Neither child had known contact with pigs . 
The source of infection is unknown , '' they added . 
`` The lack of known exposure to pigs in the two cases increases the possibility that human-to-human transmission of this new influenza virus has occurred . '' 
In the past two or so years , Finelli said , 12 known cases of infection with swine flu have been reported but 11 of them followed known contact with pigs . 
People were near the children were being questioned by CDC investigators and tested if they remember having been sick recently . 
The boy flew to Texas with his brother and is still there , the officials added . 
Blood tests may show if people were infected in the past with the same virus . 
The virus is usually fairly mild but it still kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year . 
And every few decades , a completely new strain pops up and it can cause a pandemic , a global epidemic that kills many more than usual . 
Flu experts are afraid a pandemic could come at any time and are monitoring for new strains . 
One big fear is that the H5N1 avian flu virus now mostly affecting flocks in Asia , the Middle East , Europe and Africa might mutate into a form that could cause a pandemic . 
It currently only rarely infects people but has killed 257 out of 420 infected in 15 countries since 2003 , according to the World Health Organization . 
CDC officials said that they do not believe these two cases represent the beginning of such a pandemic .

2009-04-24,"\* Mexican government announces fatal swine flu outbreak \* New mixture of viruses never seen before \* Some Mexico City residents don surgical masks -LRB- Updates with color , quotes -RRB- By Noel Randewich and Armando Tovar MEXICO CITY , April 24 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A deadly strain of swine flu never seen before has broken out in Mexico , killing at least 16 people and raising fears it is spreading across North America . 
The World Health Organization said it was concerned about what it called 800 `` influenza-like '' cases in Mexico , and also about a confirmed outbreak of a new strain of swine flu in the United States . 
Mexico canceled classes for millions of children in its sprawling capital city and surrounding areas on Friday after authorities noticed a higher number of deaths involving flu-like illness than normal in recent weeks . 
`` It is a virus that mutated from pigs and then at some point was transmitted to humans , '' Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told the Televisa network . 
He linked the disease in Mexico to a new kind of swine flu that struck seven people in California and Texas . 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the virus in the United States was a never-before-seen mixture of viruses typical among pigs , birds and humans . 
All seven American patients have recovered . 
The Mexican government warned people not to shake hands or kiss when greeting or share food , glasses or cutlery for fear of contracting the flu . 
Mexico City , one of the world 's biggest cities and home to some 20 million people , was quieter than usual on Friday morning . 
Normally choking traffic was less chaotic in the absence of school buses and parents driving kids to school . 
Many people waiting to enter subway stations had their faces covered with surgical masks . 
The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 . 
It contains DNA typical to avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , the CDC has said . 
WHO said about 60 people in Mexico have died from the disease . 
The Geneva-based U.N. agency said it was in daily contact with U.S. , Canadian and Mexican authorities and had activated its Strategic Health Operations Center -LRB- SHOC -RRB- -- its command and control center for acute public health events . 
Surveillance for and scrutiny of influenza has been stepped up since 2003 , when H5N1 bird flu reappeared in Asia . 
Experts fear this strain , or another strain , could spark a pandemic that could kill millions .

2009-04-24,"A police woman wears a mask in Mexico City April 24 , 2009 . 
MEXICO CITY | Fri Apr 24 , 2009 7:50 pm EDT MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A strain of flu never seen before has killed up to 60 people in Mexico and also appeared in the United States , where eight people were infected but recovered , health officials said on Friday . 
Mexico 's government said at least 20 people have died of the flu and it may also be responsible for 40 other deaths . 
It shut down schools and canceled major public events in Mexico City to try to prevent more deaths in the sprawling , overcrowded capital . 
Authorities said they had enough antiviral medicine to treat about 1,000 suspected cases reported so far . 
The World Health Organization said tests showed the virus from 12 of the Mexican patients was the same genetically as a new strain of swine flu , designated H1N1 , seen in eight people in California and Texas . 
`` Our concern has grown as of yesterday , '' Dr. Richard Besser , acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in a telephone briefing . 
Global health officials were not ready to declare a pandemic -- a global epidemic of a new and deadly disease such as flu . 
`` So far there has not been any change in the pandemic threat level , '' Besser said . 
But the human-to-human spread of the new virus raised fears of a major outbreak . 
Mexico 's government suspended classes for millions of children in Mexico City , where scared residents rushed out to buy face masks and kept their kids at home . 
`` We 're frightened because they say it 's not exactly flu , it 's another kind of virus and we 're not vaccinated , '' said Angeles Rivera , 34 , a government worker who fetched her son from a public kindergarten that was closing . 
Close analysis showed the disease is a mixture of swine , human and avian viruses , according to the CDC . 
Humans can occasionally catch swine flu from pigs but rarely have they been known to pass it on to other people . 
Mexico reported 1,004 suspected cases of the new virus , including four possible cases in Mexicali on the border with California . 
Most of the dead were aged between 25 and 45 , a health official said . 
It was a worrying sign as seasonal flu can be more deadly among the very young and the very old but a hallmark of pandemics is that they affect healthy young adults . 
Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said Mexico has enough antiviral drugs to combat the outbreak for the moment . 
`` In the last 20 hours , fewer serious cases of this disease and fewer deaths have been reported , '' he told reporters . 
The WHO said the virus appears to be susceptible to Roche AG 's flu drug Tamiflu , also known as oseltamivir , but not to older flu drugs such as amantadine . 
Canada has not reported any cases of the flu and is not issuing a travel warning for Mexico , but the country 's chief public health officer David Butler-Jones said the outbreak was `` very concerning '' and Canada was paying close attention . 
The CDC 's Besser said it was probably too late to contain the outbreak . 
`` There are things that we see that suggest that containment is not very likely , '' he said . 
Once it has spread beyond a limited geographical area it would be difficult to control . 
But there is no reason to avoid Mexico , CDC and the WHO said . 
`` CDC is not recommending any additional recommendations for travelers to California , Texas and Mexico , '' Besser said . 
Worldwide , seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year , but the flu season for North America should have been winding down . 
The U.S. government said it was closely following the new cases . 
`` The White House is taking the situation seriously and monitoring for any new developments . 
The president has been fully briefed , '' an administration official said . 
In California , where six people have been infected with the flu , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said authorities were monitoring patients with flu-like symptoms and communicating with Mexican health officials . 
Mexico 's government cautioned people not to shake hands or kiss when greeting or to share food , glasses or cutlery . 
Flu virus can be spread on the hands , and handwashing is one of the most important ways to prevent its spread . 
The outbreak jolted residents of the Mexican capital , one of the world 's biggest cities with around 20 million residents . 
One pharmacy ran out of surgical face masks after selling 300 in a day . 
The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 . 
It contains DNA from avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , said the CDC , which is already working on a vaccine . 
Scientists were trying to understand why there are so many deaths in Mexico when the infections in the United States seem mild , Besser said . 
The CDC said it will issue daily updates here Surveillance for and scrutiny of influenza has been stepped up since 2003 , when H5N1 bird flu reappeared in Asia . 
Experts fear that or another strain could cause a pandemic that could kill millions . 
The last flu pandemic was in 1968 when `` Hong Kong '' flu killed about a million people globally .

2009-04-25,"Mexico swine flu outbreak triggers global pandemic fears Up to 70 dead as swine flu outbreak sweeps Mexico , crosses US border and prompts worldwide pandemic panic After a deadly outbreak of swine flu , people wearing surgical masks queue for medical checks at Mexico City 's general hospital . 
Photograph : Dario Lopez-Mills\/AP A killer virus that has caused at least 20 deaths and sparked widespread panic in Mexico has the potential to become a global pandemic , warn health experts . 
The World Health Organisation stopped short of issuing a worldwide alert over the swine flu strain a unique mix of human , pig and bird viruses but its director general , Dr Margaret Chan , said the option remained `` on the table '' . 
The virus , which may be responsible for a further 48 deaths in Mexico , has thrown the country into confusion . 
There are a total of 1,004 cases and eight have been detected over the border in Texas and California . 
Today , people in Mexico City were being ordered not to kiss or shake hands , football matches went ahead without spectators , theaters , shops and museums closed , staff were inside locked schools scrubbing classrooms with disinfectant and health workers patrolled buses , ordering sickly-looking people home . 
Scientists have long feared that a new flu virus could launch a worldwide pandemic . 
Evolving when different flu viruses infect a pig , a person or a bird , mingling their genetic material , the hybrid could spread quickly because people would have no natural defences . 
`` We are seeing a range of severity of the disease , from mild to severe and of course death , '' said Chan . 
`` The eight cases in the US have been mild in terms of severity and it is too premature to calculate the mortality rate of this disease . '' 
In New York the results of tests for swine flu on 75 children remain unclear after a school trip returned from Mexico with pupils complaining of illness . 
Mexico 's health secretary Jose Angel Cordova said : `` We are very , very concerned . '' 
Any doubts over of the extent of the emergency were dispelled today by the sight of soldiers handing out blue surgical masks to pedestrians and motorists along Mexico City 's central Reforma boulevard . 
With TV and radio calling on the population to seek medical advice for any flu-like symptoms , queues sprouted at health clinics and hospitals across the city . 
President Felipe Calder n said his government learned only on Thursday night what kind of virus Mexico was facing after tests by specialist laboratories in Canada confirmed the outbreak as a type labeled A\/H1N1 not previously seen in pigs or humans . 
Few cases have had any contact with live pigs . 
The WHO said the virus appeared to be able to spread from human to human and contained human virus , avian virus and pig viruses from North America , Europe and Asia . 
It might be completely new or has only now been detected . 
Given how quickly flu can spread , there might be cases incubating around the world already , said Dr Michael Osterholm at the University of Minnesota : `` Hundreds and thousands of travellers come in and out -LRB- of Mexico -RRB- every day . 
You 'd have to believe there 's been more unrecognised transmission that 's occurred . '' 
It was unclear how much protection current vaccines might offer . 
A `` seed stock '' genetically matched to the new virus has already been created by the US Centers for Disease Control . 
If the US government decides vaccine production is necessary , it would be used by manufacturers to get started . 
At Mexico City 's international airport , passengers were questioned to try to prevent anyone with flu symptoms from boarding aeroplanes and spreading the disease . 
Britain 's Foreign Office issued a warning to travellers about the outbreak but stopped short of recommending people did not visit Mexico . 
US health officials did the same , urging visitors to wash their hands frequently . 
In Asia , which has fought hard to contain the H5N1 bird flu virus , which has killed at least 257 people worldwide since late 2003 , tighter enforcements were being made . 
Passengers and pork products from Mexico were being checked at many airports . 
Health authorities in Thailand and Hong Kong said they were closely monitoring the situation . 
At Tokyo 's Narita airport among the world 's busiest with more than 96,000 people using it daily officials installed a device at the arrival gate for flights from Mexico to measure the temperatures of passengers . 
` We are increasing health surveillance following the outbreak of swine flu , '' said Akira Yukitoki , an official at the Japanese airport 's quarantine station . 
He said 160 passengers arriving from Mexico yesterday were screened . 
The airport also plans to put up signs urging tourists to `` wear masks , wash hands and gargle '' , Yukitoki said . 
In the Philippines , the government was also tightening monitoring at all ports to prevent the entry of any pigs or pork from Mexico and the US . 
`` We 've seen swine influenza in humans over the past several years , and in most cases , it 's come from direct pig contact . 
This seems to be different , '' said Dr Arnold Monto , a flu expert with the University of Michigan . 
`` I think we need to be careful and not apprehensive , but certainly paying attention to new developments as they proceed . '' 
While the fear is palpable among Mexico City 's 20 million residents , confusion mixed with traditional mistrust of official statements means widespread suspicion that the government is not telling the whole truth about the disease . 
The government had claimed until late on Thursday that there was nothing unusual about the flu cases and the sudden turnaround that saw schools closed across the capital on Friday angered many Mexicans . 
Government workers were ordered to wear masks , and authorities urged residents to stay home from work if they felt ill . 
What seems almost certain is that the doors of all nurseries , kindergartens , schools and universities in the vast metropolis of 20 million people will remain closed this week . 
With the authorities urging people to avoid crowds , the atmosphere inside the metro and crowded buses is notably tense . 
Health secretary Cordova , a devout Catholic , stopped short of urging Mexicans not to go to mass tomorrow , but he did emphasise that a nod of the head was better than a handshake when it came to greeting friends .

2009-04-25,"Saturday 25 April 2009 23.24 BST Swine flu has similar symptoms to the more common , human seasonal form of influenza . 
It is one of a number of viruses that cause illness among people and animals , causing respiratory problems , fever and fatigue . 
Avian flu - which has previously been the subject of pandemic fears after humans began contracting it - is another deadly strain . 
According to the Health Protection Agency , outbreaks of swine flu - a disease caused by type A influenza - regularly affect pigs . 
People who are around pigs are most likely to suffer from the H1N1 virus but it is also possible for the virus to spread from person to person . 
Evoking memories of the fears associated with bird flu , the latest perceived threat of a pandemic was brought to public attention after cases of human swine flu were reported in Mexico and parts of California and Texas in the US . 
There have been no cases identified in the UK for at least 10 years . 
Scientists found this virus is contagious and spreading from human to human although they do not know how easily the virus spreads between people , the HPA said . 
The symptoms of swine influenza in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human seasonal flu and include fever , fatigue , lack of appetite , coughing and sore throat . 
Some people have also reported vomiting and diarrhoea . 
Testing has shown that the human swine influenza H1N1 can be treated with the antivirals oseltamavir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- and zanamivir -LRB- Relenza -RRB- . 
Seasonal flu is caused by viruses that are adapted to spread in humans , who have some natural immunity to common strains and can boost it by immunisation with a vaccine . 
Avian flu is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in birds while swine flu is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in pigs . 
Potentially major problems can arise when human and animal flu viruses mix and lead to the development of new viruses which are resistant to immunity and can spread through the population , sparking a pandemic . 
The HPA said it was too early to say whether the cases in Mexico and the US would lead to a larger outbreak or could represent the appearance of a potential pandemic strain of influenza virus . 
There is currently insufficient evidence to understand the extent to which the cases are firmly linked . 
Experts from around the world are working in close collaboration with the World Health Organisation to help determine what risk this situation poses to global public health .

2009-04-25,"Cabin crew member in hospital after flight from swine flu-struck Mexico World Health Organisation has warned countries to be on alert for any unusual flu outbreaks Saturday 25 April 2009 22.09 BST A member of cabin crew was taken to hospital with '' flu - like symptoms '' today after falling ill on a British Airways flight from Mexico City to Heathrow . 
The World Health Organisation has warned countries to be on alert for any unusual flu outbreaks after a swine flu virus was implicated in possibly dozens of human deaths in Mexico . 
The BA employee , who has not been named , has been taken to Northwick Park hospital in Harrow , a hospital spokesman said . 
He added : `` He has flu-like symptoms and is responding well to treatment . 
The patient was admitted directly to a side room and the hospital is scrupulously following infection control procedures to ensure there is no risk to any other individual in the hospital . '' 
The man was taken from flight BA242 which landed at 2pm today , a BA spokesman said . 
A Health Protection Agency spokesman said : `` We are aware of a patient admitted to a London hospital with reported travel history to Mexico . 
`` As a precautionary measure the patient is being tested for a range of respiratory and other illnesses in line with UK health guidance . 
At present there have been no confirmed cases of human swine flu in the UK or anywhere in Europe . '' 
A spokesman for Hillingdon Council , which is responsible for the health of people passing through the airport , said : `` As the port authority for Heathrow Airport we already have Health Protection Agency doctors in each of the airport 's terminals at all times . 
`` Should we receive instructions from the Department for Health or the Health Protection Agency we will be well placed to respond appropriately . '' 
World Health Organisation director-general Margaret Chan has said the outbreak in Mexico involves `` an animal strain of the H1N1 virus '' . 
The flu virus , which is suspected of killing at least 60 people in Mexico , has the potential to become a pandemic , she said . 
"
2009-04-25,"MEXICO CITY | Sat Apr 25 , 2009 12:51 am BST MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A dangerous strain of flu never seen before has killed up to 60 people in Mexico and spread into the United States , where several people were reported ill . 
Here are some questions and answers about the virus : HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED ? 
Mexico has confirmed 20 deaths from the flu and has 40 other possible fatalities and 1,004 people reported infected . 
Most of those who died are aged between 25 and 45 . 
In California and Texas , eight people were infected with the new strain , but all of them have recovered . 
WHAT KIND OF FLU IS IT AND HOW IS IT SPREADING ? 
The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 and is spreading from person to person . 
It contains DNA from avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention , or CDC . 
The virus is being passed on by sneezing , coughing or physical contact . 
Though a link to swine flu was originally suspected , the Mexican government has now ruled out any risk of infection from eating pork . 
The CDC says it is too early to fully assess the threat posed by the new flu virus . 
The Mexican government said on Friday the rate of deaths has slowed in recent hours and that it has a million doses of antiviral drugs , which is more than enough to treat all reported cases . 
Central American countries were not reporting any cases of the new flu for the time being . 
HAS MEXICO EVER SEEN AN OUTBREAK LIKE THIS BEFORE ? 
Mexico has not suffered a serious flu epidemic before . 
Many Mexicans vaccinate themselves against common flu , which hits each year in a season that normally ends in February or March . 
Worldwide , seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year . 
WHAT MEASURES IS THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TAKING ? 
Mexico City has closed universities and schools until further notice , suspended all major public events and advised people feeling flu-like symptoms to stay home from work . 
Mexico City 's busiest subway stations are handing out face masks to passengers to use on crowded train carriages . 
The city government has closed museums , including the popular Anthropology Museum . 
Authorities recommend people avoid crowded places and have cautioned people not to shake hands or kiss when greeting or to share food , glasses or cutlery . 
The government has also extended the deadline on filing tax returns by a month to the end of May . 
WHAT IS THE REST OF THE WORLD DOING TO HELP ? 
The U.S. government said it was taking the situation seriously and monitoring for any new developments . 
The CDC said it is working on a vaccine . 
Geneva-based U.N. agency the World Health Organisation said it was in close contact with U.S. , Canadian and Mexican authorities and had activated its Strategic Health Operations Centre -- its command and control center for acute public health events . 
The WHO says it is ready to use rapid containment measures if needed , including antivirals , and said Mexico is well-equipped to handle the outbreak . 
SHOULD TOURISTS WITH TRIPS PLANNED TO MEXICO BE WORRIED ? 
The CDC and the WHO say there is no need to alter travel plans and Mexico said it saw no need to close its borders . 
Canada 's government has advised doctors to be on the alert for reports of illness from people who recently traveled to Mexico , but has not recommended canceling trips . 
"
2009-04-25,"Sat Apr 25 , 2009 12:51 am BST -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Health officials around the globe are closely watching an outbreak of a new kind of flu that has killed at least 60 people in Mexico and infected seven in the United States . 
Health officials have been warning that a new strain of influenza that can pass easily from person to person could spark a pandemic , a global epidemic that could kills tens of millions of people . 
Experts agree another flu pandemic is overdue . 
Here are some facts about past flu pandemics and pandemic threats : \* The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic is the benchmark by which all modern pandemics are measured . 
Some 20 to 40 percent of the worldwide population became ill and more than 50 million people died . 
Between September 1918 and April 1919 , it killed more than 600,000 people in the United States alone . 
In a normal flu season , about 36,000 people die in the United States , and 250,000 to 500,000 globally . 
\* While the very young and the very old are most at risk with seasonal flu , the 1918 pandemic primarily struck young adults . 
It disrupted the global economy . 
Many small businesses , which were unable to unable to operate during the pandemic , went bankrupt . 
\* The virus that caused the 1957 Asian flu pandemic was quickly identified , and vaccines were available by August 1957 . 
The elderly had the highest rates of death . 
The Asian flu killed 2 million people globally , according to the World Health Organisation . 
\* The 1968 influenza pandemic was first detected in Hong Kong . 
Those over the age of 65 were most likely to die . 
It killed an estimated 1 million people globally , according to WHO , making it making the mildest pandemic in the 20th century . 
\* In 1976 , a strain of swine flu started infecting people in Fort Dix , New Jersey , and worried U.S. health officials because the virus was thought to be related to the 1918 Spanish flu virus . 
Forty million people were vaccinated but the program was halted after several cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome , a severe and sometimes fatal condition linked to some vaccines , were reported . 
The virus never moved outside the Fort Dix area . 
\* H5N1 avian flu is the most recent pandemic threat . 
It first surfaced in 1997 and continues to infect humans who have direct contact with chickens . 
The H5N1 or avian influenza virus does not spread easily from one person to another . 
\* Since 2003 , H5N1 virus has infected 421 people in 15 countries and killed 257 . 
It has killed or forced the culling of more than 300 million birds in 61 countries in Asia , the Middle East , Africa and Europe . 
\* WHO has six pandemic stages . 
A full-blown pandemic requires sustained , human-to-human spread over many countries of a new and serious virus .

2009-04-25,"2009 04 25 08:50 JST By Alistair Bell and Noel Randewich MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A strain of flu never seen before has killed up to 60 people in Mexico and also appeared in the United States , where eight people were infected but recovered , health officials said on Friday . 
Mexico 's government said at least 20 people have died of the flu and it may also be responsible for 40 other deaths . 
It shut down schools and canceled major public events in Mexico City to try to prevent more deaths in the sprawling , overcrowded capital . 
Authorities said they had enough antiviral medicine to treat about 1,000 suspected cases reported so far . 
The World Health Organization said tests showed the virus from 12 of the Mexican patients was the same genetically as a new strain of swine flu , designated H1N1 , seen in eight people in California and Texas . 
`` Our concern has grown as of yesterday , '' Dr. Richard Besser , acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in a telephone briefing . 
Global health officials were not ready to declare a pandemic -- a global epidemic of a new and deadly disease such as flu . 
`` So far there has not been any change in the pandemic threat level , '' Besser said . 
But the human-to-human spread of the new virus raised fears of a major outbreak . 
Mexico 's government suspended classes for millions of children in Mexico City , where scared residents rushed out to buy face masks and kept their kids at home . 
"
2009-04-25,"MEXICO CITY\/GENEVA | Sat Apr 25 , 2009 7:32 pm EDT MEXICO CITY\/GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A new flu that has killed up to 68 people in Mexico could start a global epidemic , the World Health Organization warned on Saturday , as tests showed the strain might be spreading in the United States . 
Mexico 's crowded capital , where most of the deaths happened and home to some 20 million people , hunkered down in fear of the swine flu . 
Tests confirmed that eight New York City schoolchildren had a type A influenza virus that was likely to be the swine flu , the city 's health commissioner said . 
Kansas state health officials confirmed two cases of swine flu , CNN reported , adding to the original eight cases in the United States . 
Officials from WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention helped Mexican health experts test hundreds of patients with flu symptoms for the never-before-seen virus . 
In Mexico City , parents canceled kids ' parties , bars were closed and residents stocked up on DVDs as people stayed home for the weekend to avoid contamination . 
`` I think it 's worse than they 're telling us , '' said 35-year-old Lidia Diaz , sniffling and wearing a surgical mask as she headed to a clinic in the capital . 
WHO declared the outbreaks a `` public health event of international concern '' and urged all countries to boost their surveillance for any unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . 
The agency stopped short of raising the threat level for a pandemic -- a global epidemic of serious disease . 
`` It has pandemic potential because it is infecting people , '' WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said in Geneva . 
`` However , we can not say on the basis of currently available laboratory , epidemiological and clinical evidence whether or not it will indeed cause a pandemic . '' 
The last flu pandemic was in 1968 when `` Hong Kong '' flu killed about a million people globally . 
A pandemic would deal a major blow to a world economy already knocked into its worst recession in decades by the crisis in financial markets . 
As far away as Hong Kong and Japan , health officials stepped up checks of travelers with flu-like symptoms , and the CDC said it was actively looking for new infections in the United States . 
`` We are worried and because we are worried we are acting aggressively on a number of fronts , '' the CDC 's Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters . 
`` The situation is serious . '' 
Mexico has said the flu had killed 20 people and could be to blame for 48 more deaths . 
In all , more than 1,000 suspected cases have been reported nationwide . 
Most of the dead were aged 25 to 45 , a worrying sign because a hallmark of past pandemics has been high fatalities among healthy young adults . 
The new flu strain -- a mixture of swine , human and avian flu viruses -- is still poorly understood . 
Mexico has shut schools and museums and canceled hundreds of public events in the capital to prevent further infections . 
A significant worsening of the outbreak could hit tourism and consumer spending in a country already weakened by the global economic crisis and an army-led war on drug cartels . 
Calderon reassured Mexicans that the flu was `` curable '' , while Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said his goal was to slow the spread of the virus in the capital . 
No countries or global bodies have issued travel bans to Mexico , but some countries alerted travelers to check websites for information on the flu outbreak . 
The WHO says the virus from 12 of the Mexican patients is genetically the same as a new strain of swine flu , designated H1N1 , seen in eight people in California and Texas . 
All of the eight have recovered . 
"
2009-04-26,"Mexico has ramped up its containment efforts Mexican authorities have taken drastic measures to contain a new strain of the swine flu virus that has killed 81 and prompted fears of a global pandemic . 
The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- says the situation remains serious but `` the picture is evolving '' . 
Several countries have reported suspected cases of infection - the latest were eight students in New York who were confirmed to have swine flu . 
But US cases of infections had not had contact with pigs , the WHO said . 
Swine flu is a respiratory disease found in pigs Human cases usually occur in those who have contact with pigs Human-to-human transmission is rare and such cases are closely monitored H1N1 is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans , but the newly detected version contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds . 
The respiratory virus - which infects pigs but only sporadically humans - is spread mainly through coughs and sneezes . 
The WHO has warned the virus has the potential to become a pandemic , and has urged all governments to step up surveillance . 
Several countries in Asia and Latin America have begun screening airport passengers for symptoms . 
Although all of the deaths so far have been in Mexico , the flu is spreading in the United States and suspected cases have been detected elsewhere : Susan Watts , BBC Science editor The next few days and weeks will be crucial . 
One possibly hopeful sign is that of the eight cases in the US there has been only one hospitalisation , and no deaths . 
So it may turn out that there is some other kind of infection at work in Mexico , as well as the new flu virus . 
Eleven confirmed infections in the US In addition , eight suspected cases are being investigated at a New York City high school where about 200 students fell mildly ill with flu-like symptoms Ten New Zealand students are among a group which traveled to Mexico have tested positive for influenza A - making it `` likely '' , though not definite , that they are infected with swine flu , said Health Minister Tony Ryall In France , a top health official told Le Parisien newspaper there were unconfirmed suspicions that two individuals who had just returned from Mexico may be carrying the virus Spain 's health ministry says three people who returned from a trip from Mexico with flu symptoms are in isolation and being tested In Israel , medics are testing a 26-year-old man who has been taken to hospital with flu-like symptoms after returning from a trip to Mexico But a UK hospital conducting tests for swine flu on a British Airways cabin crew member said the tests proved negative . 
The Mexican government , which has faced criticism for what some see as a slow reaction to this outbreak , is now taking an increasingly hard line to try to contain the virus , says the BBC 's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City . 
Public buildings have been closed and hundreds of public events suspended . 
There is a sense of chaos in hospitals and we do not know what to do BBC reader Antonio Chavez , Mexico City Schools in and around Mexico City have been closed until 6 May , and some 70 % of bars and restaurants in the capital have been temporarily closed . 
People are being strongly urged to avoid shaking hands , and the US embassy has advised visitors to the country to keep at least six feet -LRB- 1.8 m -RRB- from other people . 
Mexico 's Health Secretary , Jose Cordova , said a total of 1,324 people had been admitted to hospital with suspected symptoms since 13 April and were being tested for the virus . 
`` In that same period , 81 deaths were recorded probably linked to the virus but only in 20 cases we have the laboratory tests to confirm it , '' he said . 
Mexico 's President Felipe Calderon has announced emergency measures to deal with the situation . 
They include powers to isolate individuals suspected of having the virus without fear of legal repercussions . 
In Mexico , face masks are handed out , while the head of the WHO voices concern In the US , seven people in California , two people in Texas , and two people in Kansas have been infected with the new strain . 
In New York , city health commissioner Dr Thomas Frieden said preliminary tests conducted on the ailing students showed they were possible cases of swine flu . 
Further tests will clarify if it was the same strain that was detected in the other three states . 
Following a meeting of its emergency committee on Saturday , the WHO said the virus had the potential to become a pandemic but it was too early to say whether that would happen . 
1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times - infecting up to 40 % of the world 's population and killing more than 50m people , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people . 
Caused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks . 
The elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die WHO Director General Margaret Chan said recent events constituted `` a public health emergency of international concern '' and that countries needed to co-operate in heightening surveillance . 
The WHO is advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young healthy adults , a characteristic of past pandemics . 
Officials said most of those killed so far in Mexico were young adults - rather than more vulnerable children and the elderly . 
There is currently no vaccine for the new strain but severe cases can be treated with antiviral medication . 
It is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains .

2009-04-26,"Face masks are handed out , while the head of the WHO voices concern A new flu virus suspected of killing as many as 81 people in Mexico has the potential to become a pandemic , the World Health Organization 's chief says . 
Margaret Chan said the outbreak was a `` health emergency of international concern '' and must be closely monitored . 
Health experts say tests so far seem to link the illnesses in Mexico with a swine flu virus in the southern US . 
Several people have also fallen ill in the US , and the authorities there are watching the situation . 
A top US health official said the strain of swine flu had spread widely and could not be contained . 
Speaking after a meeting of the WHO 's emergency committee , Mrs Chan said that `` the current events constitute a public health emergency of international concern '' . 
Yeny Gregorio Davila , Mexico City The WHO is advising all member states to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young healthy adults . 
Officials said most of those killed so far in Mexico were young adults - rather than more vulnerable children and the elderly . 
The committee has not recommended declaring an international public health emergency and raising the global pandemic alert level , a move that could lead to travel advisories , trade restrictions and border closures . 
At least some of the cases show a new version of the H1N1 swine flu sub-strain - a respiratory disease which infects pigs but only sporadically infects humans . 
The RC church has issued advice to its priests to help halt the spread of the flu H1N1 is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans , but the newly-detected version contains genetic material from versions which usually affect pigs and birds . 
The virus is spread through coughs and sneezes and through direct and indirect contact between people . 
Mexican officials have confirmed 20 deaths from the virus and are investigating dozens more . 
Schools , museums and libraries have been closed across the capital 's region and people are being urged to avoid shaking hands or sharing crockery . 
Hundreds of public events have been suspended and schools in the Mexico City area have been closed until 6 May . 
Two previously sold-out soccer matches were played in empty stadiums to avoid potentially spreading the virus . 
Health officials are isolating individuals suspected of having the virus and inspecting their homes . 
The Roman Catholic Church in Mexico has recommended measures to avoid further contagion at Mass this Sunday . 
Priests have been told to place communion wafers in the hands of worshippers rather than in their mouths and to suggest to the congregation that kissing or shaking hands be avoided during the service . 
In the US , 11 people are now known to have been infected with the new strain - seven people in California , two in Texas , and two in Kansas . 
There are also eight suspected cases in New York City after 200 students at a high school fell ill . 
Specimens were taken from nine students , and eight were determined to be probable cases of swine flu , said city health commissioner Dr Thomas Frieden . 
Those samples are now being examined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- . 
No children had required hospital treatment and many had fully recovered , said Dr Frieden , but the school could remain closed out of `` an abundance of caution '' . 
He urged people to maintain basic hygiene , such and covering their mouths when coughing and sneezing , washing hands regularly and keeping surfaces clean . 
Dr Frieden said most people would not need to take antiviral medication if they fell ill , unless they had an underlying medical condition . 
CDC officials have said that with cases arising in so many communities , containment is unlikely to be feasible . 
There is currently no vaccine for the new strain . 
Swine flu is a respiratory disease found in pigs Human cases usually occur in those who have contact with pigs Human-to-human transmission is rare and such cases are closely monitored Tom Skinner of the CDC told the BBC that it was too early too tell how widespread the impact would be . 
`` We do n't know how well or efficiently this virus is spreading and how easily it is going to be sustained in the human population . '' 
He said it was not yet clear which side of the border the virus had originated . 
But the US was likely to take `` normal and routine '' steps within the next few days to screen passengers coming into the US and to distribute information , he said . 
The CDC plans to send experts to Mexico to help investigate the virus which has infected more than 1,000 people in the country . 
The BBC science editor Susan Watts says the new strain is a classic `` re-assortment '' - a combination feared most by those watching for the flu pandemic .

2009-04-26,"Nicola Sturgeon : ` The patients in question are undergoing further tests ' Two people have been admitted to a Scottish hospital after returning from Mexico , where more than 80 people have died after contracting swine flu . 
Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said the patients had both displayed mild flu-like symptoms but were not giving cause for concern . 
Neither of the people involved had traveled in areas affected by swine flu outbreaks . 
The Scottish Government said it was closely monitoring the situation . 
It is understood the two travellers were admitted to Monklands hospital in Airdrie , Lanarkshire , after returning from Mexico on Tuesday . 
Precautionary tests are being conducted on them , with further tests expected over the next few days . 
Ms Sturgeon said there was `` no immediate threat to public health in Scotland '' . 
She added : `` The patients have displayed mild flu-like symptoms and their current condition is not causing concern . 
Monitoring of those who have been in close contact with the two people is also being carried out as an additional precaution . 
The patients have been admitted to Monklands hospital `` The Scottish Government , in conjunction with other administrations in the UK , are closely monitoring the situation and assessing the implications , if any , of this situation for Scotland . 
`` The situation is also being monitored closely and assessed by the international organizations dealing with the prevention and control of infectious diseases . '' 
As a precaution , the Scottish Government resilience room has been opened and is working closely with London to monitor the situation , Ms Sturgeon said . 
Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond chaired a meeting of relevant ministers and officials on Sunday , and Ms Sturgeon has spoken with UK Health Secretary Alan Johnson about the development . 
Ms Sturgeon said : `` The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- has said UK planning for a flu pandemic is among the most advanced in the world but we can not afford to be complacent . 
`` The Scottish Government takes the threat of a flu pandemic very seriously and have been working with local responders for a number of years to ensure that Scotland is in the best possible position to manage an emergency on such a scale . 
`` The H1N1 swine fever virus is sensitive to the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza . 
We have significant stockpiles for Scotland . '' 
The WHO has warned that the new strain of the swine flu virus that has killed 81 people in Mexico could become a global pandemic . 
Several other countries have reported suspected cases of infection , including eight students at a New York school who were confirmed to have swine flu . 
There have been no confirmed cases of swine flu in the UK or elsewhere in Europe . 
Dr Jim McMenamin , consultant epidemiologist for Health Protection Scotland , said the two patients were being treated with anti-viral medicine which would prevent the condition becoming worse . 
He said : `` The evidence so far from the United States and Mexico is that the anti-virals , which would normally be used for the treatment of influenza , are effective for this condition . '' 
The doctor said : `` It is early days in our investigation globally about this phenomenon of swine flu . 
We will be kept continually updated by the World Health Organisation . 
`` Currently there is a public health emergency of international concern and we in Scotland have to play our part in any potential case being rapidly identified . ''

2009-04-26,"Mexican swine flu deaths spark worldwide action WHO says virus has killed 81 people in Mexico as US declares public health emergency and travellers ' illnesses prompt concern in Europe and New Zealand Sunday 26 April 2009 18.45 BST People wear surgical masks as a precaution against infection on the Mexico City subway . 
Photograph : Miguel Tovar\/AP Health officials across the world scrambled to contain the outbreak of swine flu today as the death toll in Mexico rose and new suspected cases emerged in other countries as far apart as Scotland and New Zealand . 
The World Health Organisation said at least 81 people had died from severe pneumonia caused by the illness in Mexico , and tests on suspected cases were also taking place in Scotland , France and Spain . 
The US declared a public health emergency as 20 cases were confirmed in the country , including eight in New York City , one in Ohio , two in Kansas and seven in California . 
The acting director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention , Dr Richard Besser , said he expected more cases over the coming days . 
The homeland security secretary , Janet Napolitano , said the US government was releasing 12m doses of the anti- flu drug Tamiflu from a federal stockpile . 
The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- said that the virus had `` pandemic potential '' , but the world was better prepared than ever to withstand a pandemic . 
It stopped short of issuing a worldwide alert . 
Keiji Fukuda , acting WHO director general for health security and environment , said : `` I believe that the world is much , much better prepared than we have ever been for dealing with this kind of situation . '' 
Two people were this afternoon admitted to a Scottish hospital after returning from Mexico with flu-like symptoms , the Scottish health secretary said today . 
Nicola Sturgeon said the pair who flew back to Scotland on April 21 had not been in an area affected by recent outbreaks of swine influenza . 
`` The patients have displayed mild flu-like symptoms and their current condition is not causing concern , '' she said . 
The health secretary , Alan Johnson , said Britain was on `` constant alert '' . 
French health ministry officials said four possible cases of swine flu were under investigation : a family of three in the Nord region and a woman in the Paris region . 
The four recently returned from Mexico . 
Tests on two separate cases of suspected swine flu proved negative , they said . 
Spain 's health ministry said three people who had just returned from Mexico were under observation in hospitals in the northern Basque region , in south-eastern Albacete and the Mediterranean port city of Valencia . 
The New Zealand government announced today it was `` likely '' that 10 students who had recently returned from Mexico had contracted the virus . 
In London , tests showed that a cabin crew member on a British Airways flight from Mexico City did not have swine flu . 
The man , who was not named , was taken to hospital in London yesterday with `` flu-like symptoms '' after landing at Heathrow . 
A hospital spokesman said : `` I can confirm he does not have swine flu . 
All the tests have come back negative . '' 
A Health Protection Agency spokesman said : `` No cases of swine flu have been identified in the UK or anywhere in Europe . '' 
Mexican authorities ordered the closure of schools in the capital city and the states of Mexico and San Luis Potos until 6 May . 
Soldiers and health workers patrolled airports and bus stations , looking for people showing symptoms of the illness , which include a fever of more than 100F and coughing . 
The Mexican government yesterday issued a decree authorising President Felipe Calder n to invoke powers allowing the country 's health department to isolate patients and inspect homes , travellers and baggage . 
The health secretary , Jos Angel C rdova , said : `` We are very , very concerned . '' 
People in Mexico City were ordered not to kiss or shake hands yesterday . 
Football matches went ahead without spectators ; theaters , shops and museums were closed ; staff were inside locked schools scrubbing classrooms with disinfectant ; and health workers patrolled buses , ordering sickly-looking people home . 
Any doubts over the extent of the emergency were dispelled last night by the sight of soldiers handing out blue surgical masks to pedestrians and motorists along Mexico City 's central boulevard , Paseo de la Reforma . 
With TV and radio calling on the population to seek medical advice for any flu-like symptoms , queues grew at clinics and hospitals across the city . 
Calder n said specialist laboratories in Canada had confirmed the outbreak was of a type of virus labeled A\/H1N1 not previously seen in pigs or humans . 
Few of the cases appear to have had any contact with live pigs . 
The WHO said the virus appeared to be able to spread from human to human and contained human virus , avian virus and pig viruses from North America , Europe and Asia . 
Given how quickly flu can spread , there might be cases incubating around the world already , said Dr Michael Osterholm at the University of Minnesota : `` Hundreds and thousands of travellers come in and out -LRB- of Mexico -RRB- every day . '' 
At Mexico City 's international airport , passengers were questioned to try to prevent anyone with flu symptoms from boarding aircraft and spreading the disease . 
The Foreign Office issued a warning to UK travellers about the outbreak , but stopped short of recommending people not to visit Mexico . 
US health officials took a similar line , urging visitors to wash their hands frequently . 
Passengers on a plane from Mexico City were kept on board at Heathrow airport for 45 minutes today while they were questioned by health officials . 
Two inspectors boarded British Airways flight 242 to ask passengers and crew if they felt unwell .

2009-04-26,"Sunday 26 April 2009 11.25 BST An electron micrograph of the A H1N1 swine influenza virus . 
Photograph : Centers for Disease Control\/Reuters It is a contagious respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses . 
Pigs are hit by regular outbreaks . 
There are many different types of swine flu and the current cases involve the H1N1 strain of type A influenza virus . 
How do humans catch it ? 
While people do not normally catch it , humans can contract the virus , usually if they have been in close contact with pigs . 
It is also possible for the constantly changing infection to spread from person to person , which has happened in the latest outbreak . 
Experts believe it spreads in the same way as seasonal flu - through coughing and sneezing . 
The symptoms of swine influenza in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human seasonal influenza infection and include fever , fatigue , lack of appetite , coughing and sore throat . 
Some people with swine flu have also reported vomiting and diarrhoea . 
What is the difference between swine flu , avian flu and the flu commonly seen in the UK during the winter ? 
Influenza viruses are commonly circulating in the human and animal environment , with different strains causing illness in humans , bird and pigs . 
Seasonal influenza is caused by viruses that are adapted to spread in humans . 
Humans have some natural immunity to the strains that are in common circulation , and this immunity can be boosted by immunisation with a vaccine . 
Avian influenza is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in birds . 
Similarly , swine influenza is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in pigs . 
These illnesses all cause the same respiratory symptoms in sufferers and can be passed between one another . 
More than 80 people have died and thousands made ill , in Mexico in particular , although cases have also been reported in the US and New Zealand . 
However , testing has shown that the antiviral drugs oseltamavir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- and zanamivir -LRB- Relenza -RRB- appear to be effective against the human swine influenza H1N1 strain , Why should we be worried about it ? 
The World Health Organisation warned the outbreak had `` pandemic potential '' and countries were advised to step up surveillance and preparation in case the infection spreads rapidly . 
Flu viruses have the ability to change and mutate , making it difficult for drugs manufacturers to ensure effective vaccines are available . 
The new version of the H1N1 virus is a mix of different animal and human versions of the disease . 
Mixing can lead to the development of changed viruses to which humans have little immunity . 
If the flu spreads over a wide geographic area and affects a large proportion of the population it goes beyond an epidemic and becomes a pandemic . 
According to the Health Protection Agency , an influenza pandemic is defined as a new or novel influenza virus that spreads easily between humans . 
When new influenza viruses are introduced into the environment , humans do not have any natural immunity to protect against them . 
Therefore , there is a risk that that new influenza viruses could develop into a pandemic if the virus passes easily from human-to-human . 
Will it spread to the UK ? 
It is too early to say whether the cases reported so far will lead to a larger outbreak , the HPA said . 
No cases have been reported in the UK although experts are monitoring the situation closely . 
Anyone who has recently returned from affected countries should consult a doctor if they notice flu-like symptoms . 
What is being done in the UK to prevent the infection ? 
The HPA said it is working with the UK government to review the current incident and any threat it poses to UK public health . 
It advised people to follow general infection control practices and good hygiene to reduce transmission of all viruses . 
This includes covering their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing , disposing of dirty tissues promptly and carefully , washing hands frequently with soap and water and cleaning surfaces which are regularly touched . 
"
2009-04-26,"The influenza strain that has struck Mexico and the United States involves , in many cases , a never-before-seen strain of the H1N1 virus . 
The flu virus is notorious for its ability to mutate and evolve new features that allows it to escape the immune defense systems of its victims . 
The appearance of new flu strains is therefore a perennial problem for doctors and scientists . 
And experts warned last night that it may be too late to contain the new outbreak , given how widespread the known cases are . 
If the confirmed deaths are the first signs of a pandemic , then cases are probably incubating around the world by now , said Dr Michael Osterholm , a flu expert at the University of Minnesota . 
In New York City , health officials say about 75 students at a Queens high school have fallen ill with flu-like symptoms and testing is under way to rule out that is the same strain of swine flu found in Mexico . 
No vaccine specifically protects against swine flu and it is unclear how much protection current generic vaccines might offer . 
A version genetically matched to the new swine flu virus has been created by the US Centres for Disease Control , said Dr Richard Besser , the agency 's acting director . 
However , it could take months to create enough supplies for mass vaccination programs - if governments decide vaccine production is necessary . 
Two drugs , Tamiflu and Relenza , seem effective against the new strain . 
Roche , the maker of Tamiflu , said it was prepared to immediately deploy a stockpile of the drug if requested . 
Both drugs must be taken early , within a few days of the onset of symptoms , to be most effective .

2009-04-26,"cents BA cabin steward in isolation ward cents Mexico invokes special measures A British Airways cabin steward is being treated in an isolation unit at a London hospital after falling ill on a flight from Mexico , where a killer virus is believed to have caused at least 68 deaths and sparked widespread panic . 
Health experts say it has the potential to become a global pandemic . 
The BA steward was undergoing tests in a London hospital for the swine flu virus after arriving on a flight from Mexico City . 
It is the first suspected case of the new flu strain to be reported in Europe , prompting fears it may have spread across the Atlantic from Mexico . 
The World Health Organisation says the swine flu strain - a unique mix of human , pig and bird viruses - constituted a public health emergency of international concern . 
Twenty people are known to have died in Mexico so far out of a total of 1,004 reported cases , and 48 more deaths are thought to be attributable to the outbreak . 
At least nine swine flu cases have been reported in California and Texas . 
The most recently reported California case , the seventh there , was a 35-year-old woman who was treated in hospital but recovered . 
The woman , whose illness began in early April , had no known contact with the other cases . 
At least two more cases have been confirmed in Kansas , bringing the US total to 11 . 
State health officials said yesterday they had confirmed swine flu in a married couple living in the central part of the state after the husband visited Mexico . 
They have not been hospitalised , and the state described their illnesses as mild . 
Dr Jason Eberhart-Phillips , Kansas 's state health officer , said : `` Fortunately , the man and woman understand the gravity of the situation and are very willing to isolate themselves . '' 
Additionally , at least eight students at a New York high school were last night also believed to have a form of human swine flu , but authorities are not yet certain if it is the same strain that has killed people in Mexico . 
The 38-year-old BA steward is being kept in Northwick Park hospital in north-west London , which has a specialist ward for patients with suspected tropical and infectious diseases , while doctors carry out swabs and blood tests . 
A Health Protection Agency spokeswoman said : `` We are aware of a patient admitted to a London hospital with reported travel history to Mexico . 
As a precautionary measure the patient is being tested for a range of respiratory and other illnesses ... At present there have been no confirmed cases of human swine flu in the UK or anywhere in Europe . '' 
The crew member , who flew out to Mexico on 20 April , is understood to have shown symptoms of fever before embarking yesterday for the return leg to Heathrow . 
He had been suffering from high temperature , aches and dizziness the night before the return flight but was allowed through health controls at Mexico City airport to report for duty . 
He collapsed around two hours into the flight , and was isolated from the other passengers . 
None of the other crew members or passengers reported similar symptoms . 
A BA spokeswoman said : `` We can confirm one of our cabin crew felt unwell during the flight from Mexico and was taken to hospital on arrival at Heathrow . 
The Port Health Authority met the flight at Heathrow and no other passengers or crew were detained . '' 
The Mexican government yesterday issued a decree authorising President Felipe Caldern to invoke powers allowing the country 's health department to isolate patients and inspect homes , travellers and baggage . 
Mexico 's health secretary , Jos Angel Crdova , said : `` We are very , very concerned . '' 
Yesterday , people in Mexico City were being ordered not to kiss or shake hands . 
Football matches went ahead without spectators , theaters , shops and museums were closed , staff were inside locked schools scrubbing classrooms with disinfectant , and health workers patrolled buses , ordering sickly looking people home . 
The WHO stopped short of issuing a worldwide alert over the swine flu strain , but its director general , Dr Margaret Chan , said that option remained `` on the table '' . 
Scientists have long feared that a new flu virus could launch a worldwide pandemic . 
Evolving when different flu viruses infect a pig , a person or a bird , mingling their genetic material , a hybrid could spread quickly because humans would have no natural defences . 
`` We are seeing a range of severity of the disease , from mild to severe , and of course death , '' said Chan . 
`` The eight cases in the US have been mild in terms of severity and it is too premature to calculate the mortality rate of this disease . '' 
Any doubts over the extent of the emergency were dispelled last night by the sight of soldiers handing out blue surgical masks to pedestrians and motorists along Mexico City 's central boulevard , Paseo de la Reforma . 
With TV and radio calling on the population to seek medical advice for any flu-like symptoms , queues grew at clinics and hospitals across the city . 
Caldern said his government learned only on Thursday night what kind of virus Mexico was facing after tests by specialist laboratories in Canada confirmed the outbreak as a type - labeled A\/H1N1 - not previously seen in pigs or humans . 
Few of the cases appear to have had any contact with live pigs .

It was unclear how much protection current vaccines might offer . 
A `` seed stock '' genetically matched to the new virus has already been created by the US Centres for Disease Control . 
If the US government decides vaccine production is necessary , it would be used by manufacturers to get started . 
At Mexico City 's international airport , passengers were questioned to try to prevent anyone with flu symptoms from boarding aircraft and spreading the disease .

2009-04-26,"The influenza pandemic of 1918 The current swine flu outbreak is of the same strain , H1N1 , as the great flu pandemic of 1918 . 
"
2009-04-26,"Sun Apr 26 , 2009 10:12 pm BST -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.N. World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been collecting samples of the new H1N1 swine flu virus to make a new vaccine in case it is needed . 
Following are some facts about influenza vaccines . 
\* The WHO and CDC prepare samples of virus to give to industrial makers . 
\* These samples must be grown in specially produced chicken eggs . 
The virus is then purified and made into vaccines , a process that takes months . 
\* At least 20 companies make flu vaccines including Sanofi Pasteur , Australia 's CSL Ltd , GlaxoSmithKline Plc , Novartis AG , Baxter and nasal spray maker MedImmune , acquired by AstraZeneca Plc. \* Experts agree the current process for making vaccines is clumsy and outdated , but new and more efficient technologies are still a few years away . 
\* WHO and CDC experts are trying to decide if a new vaccine for the H1N1 swine flu strain is needed , or perhaps if a fourth element could be added to the seasonal flu vaccine mix for next September . 
\* The health agencies also had been considering adding some vaccines against H5N1 avian influenza , which occasionally infects people and is also considered a major pandemic threat . 
\* Tests show the H1N1 component of the current seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against the new strain . 
\* Consulting firm Oliver Wyman found that drug companies would need four years to meet global demand for vaccines if a pandemic broke out today , but new technology could significantly boost production by 2014 . 
\* Currently , drug makers could make up to 2.5 billion doses of pandemic vaccines in one year , meaning it would take four years to meet global demand , Oliver Wyman found . 
In a best-case scenario , they could make 7.7 billion doses in 1.5 years . 
\* Compounds called adjuvants can be used to boost a vaccine 's effectiveness , so it could be diluted and used in more people . 
\* Current global demand for seasonal influenza vaccine is about 500 million doses a year . 
\* The CDC recommends that 261 million Americans -- 85 percent of the population -- should be vaccinated against flu . 
A RAND Corp. study in December showed that only about a third of those who should have did get the vaccine .

2009-04-27,"WHO flu expert Dr Keiji Fukuda : ` The picture is evolving ' The international community is better prepared than ever to deal with the threatened spread of a new swine flu virus , a top UN health chief has said . 
As the UN warned the outbreak might become a pandemic , Dr Keiji Fukuda said years of preparing for bird flu had boosted world stocks of anti-virals . 
Canada is the latest country to confirm cases after as many as 103 deaths in Mexico and 20 cases in the US . 
Washington has warned the flu may yet claim American lives . 
`` I do fear that we will have deaths , '' Dr Anne Schuchat of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters . 
Eight cases have been confirmed among New York students , seven in California , two in Texas , two in Kansas and one in Ohio . 
Several countries in Asia and Latin America have begun screening airport passengers for symptoms . 
There is currently no vaccine for the new strain of flu but severe cases can be treated with antiviral medication . 
The BBC talks to people in Mexico City about the flu outbreak . 
Speaking in Geneva , an expert from the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , the UN 's health agency , expert said the swine flu virus could be capable of mutating into a more dangerous strain but that more information was needed before raising the WHO 's pandemic alert phase . 
Only a handful of the Mexican cases have so far been laboratory-confirmed as swine flu , while in the US confirmed cases had only mild symptoms . 
Health experts want to know why some people become so seriously ill , while others just get a bit of a cold , the BBC 's Imogen Foulkes reports from Switzerland . 
The WHO added that there was no evidence to suggest the outbreak was a bio-terrorist attack . 
It is advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young healthy adults , a characteristic of past pandemics . 
Swine flu is a respiratory disease found in pigs Human cases usually occur in those who have contact with pigs Human-to-human transmission is rare and such cases are closely monitored Officials said most of those killed so far in Mexico were young adults - rather than more vulnerable children and the elderly . 
It is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains . 
WHO experts will meet again in Geneva on Tuesday to discuss whether to raise the pandemic alert phase . 
H1N1 is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans but the newly detected version contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds . 
It is spread mainly through coughs and sneezes . 
1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times - infecting up to 40 % of the world 's population and killing more than 50m people , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people .

More than 1,300 people have been admitted to hospital with suspected symptoms since 13 April . 
With Mexico City apparently the center of infection , many people are choosing to leave the city , the BBC 's Stephen Gibbs reports . 
Schools , universities and even most bars and restaurants will remain closed for several days and though Sunday church services are going ahead , priests have been asked to place Communion wafers in people 's hands rather than on their tongues . 
There are those that are beginning to worry about the effects swine flu is having on their livelihoods and the Mexican economy in general , our correspondent says . 
Not knowing exactly how the virus works and how it can be killed off creates a horrible uncertainty BBC reader Mariana , Mexico City Fear of the virus is expected to persuade many tourists to cancel their holidays and Mexican exports are already beginning to be affected . 
The World Bank is providing Mexico with more than $ 200m in loans to help it deal with the outbreak . 
Russia has banned imports of raw pork and pork products from Mexico and the US states of California , Texas and Kansas until further notice as a precaution .

2009-04-27,"Swine flu causes regular outbreaks in pigs Infection control experts are scrambling to respond to outbreaks of swine flu in Mexico and the US , and suspected cases elsewhere . 
Swine flu is a respiratory disease which infects pigs . 
Caused by influenza type A , there are regular outbreaks among herds of pigs , where the disease causes high levels of illness but is rarely fatal . 
It tends to spread in autumn and winter but can circulate all year round . 
There are many different types of swine flu and like human flu , the infection is constantly changing . 
Can humans catch swine flu ? 
Swine flu does not normally infect humans , although sporadic cases do occur - usually in people who have had close contact with pigs . 
There have also been rare documented cases of humans passing the infection to other humans . 
Human-to-human transmission of swine flu is thought to spread in the same way as seasonal flu - through coughing and sneezing . 
In the latest outbreak it is clear that the disease is being passed from person to person . 
Is this a new type of swine flu ? 
The World Health Organization has confirmed that at least some of the cases are a never-before-seen version of the H1N1 strain of influenza type A. H1N1 is the same strain which causes seasonal outbreaks of flu in humans on a regular basis . 
But this latest version of H1N1 is different : it contains genetic material that is typically found in strains of the virus that affect humans , birds and swine . 
Flu viruses have the ability to swap genetic components with each other , and it seems likely that the new version of H1N1 resulted from a mixing of different versions of the virus , which may usually affect different species , in the same animal host . 
Symptoms of swine flu in humans appear to be similar to those produced by standard , seasonal flu . 
These include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue . 
Most cases so far reported around the world appear to be mild , but in Mexico lives have been lost . 
Is it safe to eat pig meat ? 
There is no evidence that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals . 
However , it is essential to cook meat properly . 
A temperature of 70C -LRB- 158F -RRB- would be sure to kill the virus . 
How worried should people be ? 
When any new strain of flu emerges that acquires the ability to pass from person to person , it is monitored very closely in case it has the potential to spark a pandemic . 
1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times . 
Caused by a form of the H1N1 strain of flu , it is estimated that up to 40 % of the world 's population were infected , and more than 50 million people died , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people . 
Caused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks . 
The impact of the pandemic was minimized by rapid action by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccine available speedily . 
The elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die The World Health Organization has warned that taken together the Mexican and US cases could potentially trigger a global pandemic , and stress that the situation is serious . 
However , it is stressed that it is still too early to accurately assess the situation fully . 
Currently , they say the world is closer to a flu pandemic than at any point since 1968 - rating the threat at three on a six-point scale . 
Nobody knows the full potential impact of the pandemic , but experts have warned that it could cost millions of lives worldwide . 
The Spanish flu pandemic , which began in 1918 , and was also caused by an H1N1 strain , killed millions of people . 
The fact that all the cases in the US have so far produced mild symptoms is encouraging . 
It suggests that the severity of the Mexican outbreak may be due to an unusual geographically-specific factor - possibly a second unrelated virus circulating in the community - which would be unlikely to come into play in the rest of the world . 
Alternatively , people infected in Mexico may have sought treatment at much later stage than those in other countries . 
It may also be the case that the form of the virus circulating in Mexico is subtly different to that elsewhere - although that will only be confirmed by laboratory analysis . 
There is also hope that , as humans are often exposed to forms of H1N1 through seasonal flu , our immune systems may have something of a head start in fighting infection . 
However , the fact that many of the victims are young does point to something unusual . 
Normal , seasonal flu tends to affect the elderly disproportionately . 
Can the virus be contained ? 
The virus appears already to have started to spread around the world , and most experts believe that containment of the virus in the era of readily available air travel will be extremely difficult . 
What about treatments and vaccines ? 
The US authorities say that two drugs commonly used to treat flu , Tamiflu and Relenza , seem to be effective at treating cases that have occurred there so far . 
However , the drugs must be administered at an early stage to be effective . 
Use of these drugs may also make it less likely that infected people will pass the virus on to others . 
The UK Government already has a stockpile of around 33 million doses of Tamiflu , ordered as a precaution against a pandemic . 
It is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains . 
US scientists are already developing a bespoke new vaccine , but it may take some time to perfect it , and manufacture enough supplies to meet what could be huge demand . 
The strain of bird flu which has caused scores of human deaths in South East Asia in recent years is a different strain to that responsible for the current outbreak of swine flu . 
The latest form of swine flu is a new type of the H1N1 strain , while bird , or avian flu , is H5N1 . 
Experts fear H5N1 hold the potential to trigger a pandemic because of its ability to mutate rapidly . 
However , up until now it has remained very much a disease of birds . 
Those humans who have been infected have , without exception , worked closely with birds , and cases of human-to-human transmission are extremely rare - there is no suggestion that H5N1 has gained the ability to pass easily from person to person .

2009-04-27,"BBC reporter on the mood in Mexico City amid empty streets and shops Governments around the world are hurrying to contain the spread of a new swine flu virus after outbreaks were reported in Mexico , the US and Canada . 
At least 100 people are now suspected to have died of the disease in Mexico . 
In Europe , health ministers called for an urgent meeting as one case of swine flu was confirmed in Spain . 
The UN has warned the virus has the potential to become a pandemic , but said the world was better prepared than ever to deal with the threat . 
Stocks of anti-viral medicines are being readied and travellers are being screened at some airports for symptoms . 
Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said suspected swine flu cases in his country had risen to 1,614 . 
Swine flu is a respiratory disease thought to spread through coughing and sneezing Symptoms mimic those of normal flu - but in Mexico more than 100 people have died Good hygiene like using a tissue and washing hands thoroughly can help reduce transmission Of the 103 deaths in Mexico , only 20 are so far confirmed to have been caused by the new virus . 
A public health emergency has been declared in the US , where 20 people are confirmed to have caught the virus . 
There are also six confirmed cases in Canada and one in Spain , where at least 17 other people are being tested for the virus . 
Investigations are being carried out on possible cases in five other countries . 
In most cases outside Mexico , people have been only mildly ill and have made a full recovery . 
Tests are also being carried out on individuals or groups in New Zealand , Australia , Brazil , Britain and Israel who fell ill following travel to Mexico World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- experts will meet in Geneva on Tuesday to discuss whether to raise the pandemic alert level The European Commission also said it was calling an urgent meeting of health ministers to discuss the situation The World Bank is providing Mexico with more than $ 200m in loans to help it deal with the outbreak Shares in airlines have fallen sharply on fears about the economic impact of the outbreak The WHO - the UN 's health agency - has said the swine flu virus could be capable of mutating into a more dangerous strain . 
The BBC talks to people in Mexico City about the flu outbreak . 
Dr Keiji Fukuda , WHO 's assistant director-general in charge of health security , said all countries were `` looking at this situation very seriously '' . 
`` But it 's also clear that we are in a period in which the picture is evolving ... -LRB- and that -RRB- we have to be very careful to collect the best possible information , '' he said . 
The WHO is advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young healthy adults , a characteristic of past pandemics . 
Most of those who have died so far in Mexico were young adults . 
The H1N1 virus is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans but the newly detected version contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds . 
There is currently no vaccine for the new strain , but severe cases can be treated with antiviral medication . 
Dr Fukuda said years of preparing for bird flu had boosted world stocks of anti-virals . 
In the US , eight cases have been confirmed among New York students , seven in California , two in Texas , two in Kansas and one in Ohio . 
1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times - infecting up to 40 % of the world 's population and killing more than 50m people , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people . 
Caused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks . 
The elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die `` I do fear that we will have deaths , '' Dr Anne Schuchat of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- told reporters . 
The Canadian cases were recorded at opposite ends of the country : two in British Columbia in the west , and four in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia . 
In Spain , a young man who had recently returned from Mexico was found to have the virus . 
He was said to be in a stable condition . 
A number of countries in Asia , Latin America and Europe have begun screening airport passengers for symptoms . 
Russia , China and Thailand have banned imports of raw pork and pork products from Mexico and parts of the US . 
But Dr Fukuda said that there was no evidence to link exposure to pork with infection . 
In the Mexican capital , schools , bars and public buildings remain closed and many people are choosing to stay indoors . 
Some people are beginning to worry about the effects swine flu is having on their livelihoods and the Mexican economy in general . 
Fear of the virus is expected to lead to many tourists canceling their holidays and Mexican exports are already beginning to be affected . 
Mexico : 103 dead - 20 confirmed to have died from swine flu , 18 confirmed ill with swine flu United States : 20 confirmed cases of swine flu Spain : 1 confirmed case , 17 others being investigated UK , Israel , Brazil , Australia and New Zealand : suspected cases being tested .

2009-04-27,"Medical Correspondent , Fergus Walsh , finds out what UK scientists are doing to combat swine flu For years now global health experts have been warning that a flu pandemic was overdue - a new strain would emerge to which there was little immunity , causing widespread epidemics . 
The fear has been that a pandemic could cause tens of millions of deaths and official predictions here suggest the death toll in the UK could range between 50,000 and 750,000 . 
This is why there is so much concern about the spread of swine flu , but the plain fact is that no-one knows yet whether this is the virus which will trigger the first pandemic since 1968 . 
One puzzling element is that there have been no deaths outside Mexico . 
So although the virus is spreading internationally , it is not yet a global killer . 
It is possible that a new flu virus might spread worldwide causing mostly mild illness , or that it might mutate at some point and become more or less virulent . 
In the immediate future , two important tasks faced by scientists are to develope rapid diagnostic tests for swine flu and to identify the optimum strain of flu to be used in a vaccine . 
Live samples of swine flu are to arrive in UK labs imminently The National Institute for Medical Research -LRB- NIMR -RRB- , in north London , is one of only five World Health Organization collaborating centres for influenza research . 
In a high level containment lab , UK scientists are getting ready to receive live samples of swine flu , which they intend to analyze in the hope of combating this disease . 
The samples will come from affected patients in California , and possibly Mexico and Spain . 
The scientists at the NIMR will take different virus samples , grow them and infect laboratory ferrets with them . 
Ferrets get flu in a similar way to humans and produce an immune response . 
Scientists will analyze the antibodies found in the ferrets ' blood and see whether the virus is showing signs of antigenic drift - in simple terms whether it is adapting and changing as it passes from person to person . 
Swine flu is an H1N1 virus , but it seems quite distinct from the human H1N1 strain included in the current seasonal , winter vaccine . 
It is unclear whether the seasonal vaccine would give any protection . 
One theory is that while it might not prevent someone getting swine flu , it could lessen its effects . 
For the moment , swine flu is not a cause for alarm in Britain , and it can not be caught from food , although raw pork should be properly cooked . 
"
2009-04-27,"Experts suspect swine flu has killed more than 100 people in Mexico As international concern about swine flu grows , the BBC 's Jill McGivering asks what relevant lessons have been learned in the past 12 years , since the emergence of the new strain of bird flu and the Sars epidemic . 
It is new , but it is also familiar - 12 years ago , a new strain of bird flu emerged in Hong Kong that was seen as the possible start of a deadly flu pandemic . 
Six years ago came the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -LRB- Sars -RRB- epidemic . 
That too was centred on Asia but caused more than 800 deaths worldwide . 
Since then , there has been massive investment in dealing with a flu-like pandemic . 
Many individual countries learned painful lessons . 
Some , like China , found they needed to be much more transparent and to improve their basic surveillance and reporting systems . 
Scientists are now in a better position to make a vaccine quickly To stop spread , cases need to be identified quickly and effectively . 
Governments needed to accept that information must be shared globally , even if the political instinct was to avoid admitting the scale of the problem . 
The continuing anxiety about a bird flu pandemic has forced bodies like the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- to invest in prevention strategies . 
There have been years of developing strategy and training on how to handle a flu pandemic - and multiple workshops and mock exercises . 
Experts have been sent around the world to assess procedures on the ground and give advice . 
Although the threat in mind was from an H5 or H9 type flu , much of the training has been generic , so it is just as relevant now . 
Scientists say the investment in global research may pay off too . 
More people now recognize that it is better for everyone if they pool information , rather than sit on it They are now in a much better position than they were 10 years ago to make a vaccine quickly , one which is perfectly matched against a particular viral strain . 
Some experts in the field say that with the heightened level of co-operation that now exists , it may be possible to have a vaccine for this form of H1N1 ready to distribute in a matter of months . 
Scientists , as well as politicians , have learned to share information more openly . 
The culture of secrecy and competition that persisted 10 years ago was addressed during the Sars crisis - and largely resolved . 
More people now recognize that it is better for everyone if they pool information , rather than sit on it , and understand that the WHO will keep a stock of any resulting vaccine so they can help poorer countries have access to it . 
Governments who found themselves on the front line of previous crises have become some of the best prepared . 
Indonesia has brought back thermal scanners used for Sars and bird flu And where people have previously experienced a threat , there seems to be more readiness for the public to accept rules and procedures which might limit individual freedoms , but could help to protect them . 
Hong Kong , for example , has kept up the practice of facial thermal imaging , introduced during Sars . 
It automatically screens every new arrival to identify those with high temperatures - a possible flu symptom . 
Governments , especially those in the developing world , have to make tough decisions about how to use their limited resources . 
Is it better to invest in protection against a possible future crisis , like a flu pandemic , which may never happen ? 
Or to focus on meeting more immediate daily health problems ? 
Fundamental questions about this new strain still need to be answered and its progress is very unpredictable . 
But whatever course it takes , most countries which have already experienced bird flu and Sars have emerged from those crises far better equipped to deal with the next one . 
"
2009-04-27,"The swine flu crisis lays bare the meat industry 's monstrous power The Mexico swine flu outbreak should alert us to a highly globalised industry with global political clout The Mexican swine flu , a genetic chimera probably conceived in the faecal mire of an industrial pigsty , suddenly threatens to give the whole world a fever . 
The initial outbreaks across North America reveal an infection already traveling at higher velocity than did the last official pandemic strain , the 1968 Hong Kong flu . 
Stealing the limelight from our officially appointed assassin , H5N1 , this porcine virus is a threat of unknown magnitude . 
It seems less lethal than Sars in 2003 , but as an influenza it may be more durable than Sars . 
Given that domesticated seasonal type-A influenzas kill as many one million people a year , even a modest increment of virulence , especially if combined with high incidence , could produce carnage equivalent to a major war . 
Meanwhile , one of its first victims has been the consoling faith , long preached by the World Health Organisation , that pandemics can be contained by the rapid responses of medical bureaucracies , independent of the quality of local public health . 
Since the initial H5N1 deaths in Hong Kong in 1997 , the WHO , with the support of most national health services , has promoted a strategy focused on the identification and isolation of a pandemic strain within its local radius of outbreak , followed by a thorough dousing of the population with antivirals and -LRB- if available -RRB- vaccine . 
An army of sceptics has contested this viral counter-insurgency approach , pointing out that microbes can now fly around the world -LRB- quite literally in the case of avian flu -RRB- faster than WHO or local officials can react to the original outbreak . 
They also pointed to the primitive , often non-existent surveillance of the interface between human and animal diseases . 
But the mythology of bold , preemptive -LRB- and cheap -RRB- intervention against avian flu has been invaluable to the cause of rich countries , like the US and UK , who prefer to invest in their own biological Maginot lines rather than dramatically increasing aid to epidemic frontlines overseas , as well as to big pharma , which has battled developing-world demands for the generic , public manufacture of critical antivirals like Roche 's Tamiflu . 
The swine flu may prove that the WHO\/Centres for Disease Control version of pandemic preparedness without massive new investment in surveillance , scientific and regulatory infrastructure , basic public health , and global access to lifeline drugs belongs to the same class of Ponzified risk management as Madoff securities . 
It is not so much that the pandemic warning system has failed as it simply does n't exist , even in North America and the EU . 
Perhaps it is not surprising that Mexico lacks both capacity and political will to monitor livestock diseases , but the situation is hardly better north of the border , where surveillance is a failed patchwork of state jurisdictions , and corporate livestock producers treat health regulations with the same contempt with which they deal with workers and animals . 
Similarly , a decade of urgent warnings by scientists has failed to ensure the transfer of sophisticated viral assay technology to the countries in the direct path of likely pandemics . 
Mexico has world-famous disease experts , but it had to send swabs to a Winnipeg lab in order to ID the strain 's genome . 
Almost a week was lost as a consequence . 
But no one was less alert than the disease controllers in Atlanta . 
According to the Washington Post , the CDC did not learn about the outbreak until six days after Mexico had begun to impose emergency measures . 
There should be no excuses . 
The paradox of this swine flu panic is that , while totally unexpected , it was accurately predicted . 
Six years ago , Science dedicated a major story to evidence that `` after years of stability , the North American swine flu virus has jumped onto an evolutionary fasttrack '' . 
Since its identification during the Great Depression , H1N1 swine flu had only drifted slightly from its original genome . 
Then in 1998 a highly pathogenic strain began to decimate sows on a farm in North Carolina and new , more virulent versions began to appear almost yearly , including a variant of H1N1 that contained the internal genes of H3N2 -LRB- the other type-A flu circulating among humans -RRB- . 
Researchers interviewed by Science worried that one of these hybrids might become a human flu -LRB- both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics are believed to have originated from the mixing of bird and human viruses inside pigs -RRB- , and urged the creation of an official surveillance system for swine flu : an admonition , of course , that went unheeded in a Washington prepared to throw away billions on bioterrorism fantasies . 
But what caused this acceleration of swine flu evolution ? 
Virologists have long believed that the intensive agricultural system of southern China is the principal engine of influenza mutation : both seasonal `` drift '' and episodic genomic `` shift '' . 
But the corporate industrialisation of livestock production has broken China 's natural monopoly on influenza evolution . 
Animal husbandry in recent decades has been transformed into something that more closely resembles the petrochemical industry than the happy family farm depicted in school readers . 
In 1965 , for instance , there were 53m US hogs on more than 1m farms ; today , 65m hogs are concentrated in 65,000 facilities . 
This has been a transition from old-fashioned pig pens to vast excremental hells , containing tens of thousands of animals with weakened immune systems suffocating in heat and manure while exchanging pathogens at blinding velocity with their fellow inmates . 
Last year a commission convened by the Pew Research Center issued a report on `` industrial farm animal production '' that underscored the acute danger that `` the continual cycling of viruses in large herds or flocks -LRB- will -RRB- increase opportunities for the generation of novel virus through mutation or recombinant events that could result in more efficient human to human transmission . '' 
The commission also warned that promiscuous antibiotic use in hog factories -LRB- cheaper than humane environments -RRB- was sponsoring the rise of resistant staph infections , while sewage spills were producing outbreaks of E coli and pfiesteria -LRB- the protozoan that has killed 1bn fish in Carolina estuaries and made ill dozens of fishermen -RRB- . 
Any amelioration of this new pathogen ecology would have to confront the monstrous power of livestock conglomerates such as Smithfield Farms -LRB- pork and beef -RRB- and Tyson -LRB- chickens -RRB- . 
The commission reported systemic obstruction of their investigation by corporations , including blatant threats to withhold funding from cooperative researchers . 
This is a highly globalised industry with global political clout . 
Just as Bangkok-based chicken giant Charoen Pokphand was able to suppress enquiries into its role in the spread of bird flu in southeast Asia , so it is likely that the forensic epidemiology of the swine flu outbreak will pound its head against the corporate stonewall of the pork industry . 
This is not to say that a smoking gun will never be found : there is already gossip in the Mexican press about an influenza epicentre around a huge Smithfield subsidiary in Veracruz state . 
But what matters more -LRB- especially given the continued threat of H5N1 -RRB- is the larger configuration : the WHO 's failed pandemic strategy , the further decline of world public health , the stranglehold of big pharma over lifeline medicines , and the planetary catastrophe of industrialised and ecologically unhinged livestock production . 
Time for a ban .

"
2009-04-27,"What is swine flu ? 
Swine influenza is a highly contagious disease that causes respiratory illness in pigs . 
Most outbreaks happen on farms in late autumn and winter , when the virus kills around 1 % to 4 % of the animals it infects . 
The disease is caused by a type A influenza virus , and the new strain belongs to the most common subtype , known as H1N1 . 
Experts are particularly anxious about flu viruses that spread from pigs to humans , because the animals can harbor several flu viruses at once , which can swap genes around and become more virulent . 
Influenza viruses are made up of only eight genes . 
The new strain has six genes from a swine flu virus known to be circulating in North America , but this virus is itself a mixture of human , pig and avian flu viruses . 
The other two genes come from a swine virus found in European and Asian pigs . 
How do humans catch it ? 
Swine flu spreads to people in two ways . 
They contract the virus after being in contact with infected pigs or areas where the pigs have been , or they catch it from an infected person . 
The disease spreads in the same way as human flu , through coughs and sneezes , or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the nose or mouth . 
The latest outbreak appears to have started in Mexico City . 
Swine flu viruses rarely infect humans , but there have been sporadic cases in the past . 
In most cases , the infection makes people unwell but is not life-threatening . 
In 1976 , a swine flu outbreak in New Jersey made more than 200 people seriously ill and killed one . 
The virus is thought to have circulated for a month before disappearing . 
In 1988 , a pregnant 32-year-old woman in Wisconsin died in hospital after becoming infected . 
Between 2005 and January 2009 , there were 12 human cases of swine flu in America , but none were fatal . 
The infection can not be spread by eating pork or pork products . 
The symptoms of swine flu are similar to normal flu , and include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue . 
Some patients have also reported diarrhoea and vomiting . 
In very young children , the warning signs include fast or troubled breathing , a bluish skin tone , a failure to interact with others , and being highly irritable . 
As with seasonal flu , swine flu varies in severity , with the worst cases leading to fatal pneumonia and respiratory failure . 
The new strain seems to be more lethal to those in the 25 to 45 age range - an ominous sign , as this was a hallmark of the Spanish 1918 flu pandemic that killed tens of millions worldwide . 
Younger people were probably hit harder by the 1918 flu virus because their immune systems over-reacted . 
Why is it spreading so fast ? 
This is a key question the World Health Organisation needs to answer . 
So far , the virus is not well enough understood to know why it is so transmissible and virulent . 
Over the next few days , epidemiologists will use information from the outbreak to work out if a global pandemic is likely . 
Further tests are needed to confirm whether the fatalities in Mexico were caused by the same virus that is causing more mild illness in America and other countries . 
What steps are being taken to contain the outbreak ? 
Most experts think it is impossible to contain the virus now it has spread from Mexico to the US and New Zealand and probably other countries . 
In Mexico , officials have banned the traditional greetings of handshakes and kisses on the cheek , barred spectators from football matches , closed museums and advised churchgoers to stay at home in an attempt to halt the spread of the disease . 
Other countries have begun screening air travellers for the disease and have set up quarantines for people who might be infected . 
In Britain , health officials have stepped up surveillance for the infection . 
The chief medical officer , Liam Donaldson , issued an alert to hospitals outlining the symptoms to look for , and what tests should be done if doctors suspect they have an infected patient . 
If the virus arrives in Britain , doctors will use the government 's # 500m stockpile of tamiflu anti-viral drugs to treat patients and protect frontline hospital staff . 
Is there a vaccine for swine flu ? 
The seasonal flu jab given to the elderly over the winter months works well against human flu viruses , but swine flu is so different , the vaccine is unlikely to be effective . 
Any decision to produce fresh vaccine for the swine flu virus will be made by the World Health Organisation . 
Making enough for Britain alone could take four to six months , an expert at the Health Protection Agency said . 
South Park nails it . 
"
2009-04-27,"Professionals may be better prepared to deal with a pandemic . 
But it does n't mean we are safe For the first time since 1976 , a strain of influenza virus - apparently related to the 1918-19 pandemic - has infected the public . 
More than 1,000 cases have been reported in Mexico , with over 80 deaths . 
And the disease has now spread to several areas within the United States and to New Zealand . 
The virus has been identified by the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- as type H1N1 , containing a mixture of swine , avian and human genetic material . 
This outbreak of influenza is viewed with alarm by public health workers . 
First , because the earlier pandemic was so deadly ; second , because this is the first clear demonstration of human-to-human spread of the infection ; and third , because it apparently started its spread after the normal '' flu season '' in the northern hemisphere . 
However , the world may be much better prepared to cope with this outbreak than before . 
One reason is that an earlier swine flu outbreak in the US , in 1976 , found both the political and medical\/public health worlds unprepared to cope with what appeared to be a serious threat of pandemic spread . 
Fortunately , the outbreak never came , but many of the lessons of that era were well learned - especially by the public health community . 
Thus , when avian flu seemed to threaten the world in recent years , both national public health bureaus around the world and the World Health Organisation organised themselves for action and began to stockpile anti-flu drugs and to ramp up the facilities for vaccine formation . 
These efforts have facilitated the early response measures for the current swine flu threat . 
Both the CDC and the WHO have mobilised to assist the Mexicans , and health offices across the world are becoming active . 
It is clear from the above that public health workers are better prepared to deal with this threat . 
Science is also better prepared than it was earlier - the genome of the virus was quickly analyzed and seed stocks for vaccine production isolated -LRB- although it will take many months to prepare enough doses to immunise large populations against the prevalent strain of virus -RRB- . 
Medicine is also better prepared , since it can distribute the already stockpiled antiviral drugs , and has far better treatments for the pneumonias and other secondary problems that threaten life . 
This is not to say that a pandemic , if it does indeed come , will not be serious . 
The illness of large numbers of people , even when the infection itself is not directly life-threatening , is often accompanied by severe social disruptions . 
Schools close , normal pursuits suffer , and emergency rooms and the entire healthcare system become seriously overloaded . 
History demonstrates that the greatest threat from even a mild disease that affects large numbers of individuals simultaneously may come from the accompanying social disruption and lack of nursing care available to the sick . 
Thus , while the professionals may be better prepared to deal with a threatened pandemic , it is not yet clear that the politicians around the world have learned the same lessons . 
Governments might have to nationalise their healthcare systems in order to cope , just as they have had to do recently with their financial systems - something that might be far more difficult in the US than in Britain and elsewhere .

Testing has shown that the human swine influenza H1N1 can be treated with the antivirals oseltamavir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- and zanamivir -LRB- Relenza -RRB- , according to the UK 's Health Protection Agency . 
The health secretary , Alan Johnson , said yesterday that Tamiflu had proved effective on patients in Mexico . 
Demand has historically been greatest for Tamiflu , which comes in tablet form , while Relenza must be inhaled . 
What do antiviral treatments do ? 
Drugs relieve some of the symptoms , reduce the potential for serious complications like pneumonia and cut the length of the illness by around a day . 
Crucially , they also reduce transmission of the virus from person to person . 
The government estimates that up to 750,000 people could die in the UK during a pandemic without antivirals . 
How much of these drugs do we have ? 
The NHS signed contracts earlier this year with pharmaceutical companies Roche , which makes Tamiflu , and GlaxoSmithKline , which makes Relenza , to double its store of antiviral drugs , bringing our total capacity to 33.5 million treatment courses . 
The government 's store would cover 50 % of the population everyone predicted to fall ill in the event of a pandemic . 
It says the UK is already widely recognized as one of the best prepared countries in the world . 
Previous flu pandemics have infected between 25 % and 35 % of the population . 
Scientists are working on developing a vaccine against the new strain . 
But reporters at a European commission briefing in Luxembourg were told that although the industry was working as fast as possible and new measures meant it could be on the market much quicker than a normal vaccine , the process could still take up to half a year .

If you have been to Mexico since the outbreak of the H1N1 virus , what was the reaction from loved ones ?

It appears US television network Fox made the right move when they opted not to air Barack Obama 's press conference last night . 
The network won the primetime 8pm time slot , drawing 7.88 million viewers to their show Lie To Me starring London-born actor Tim Roth . 
The show snagged more viewers at that time slot than any other network . 
However , 19 million people tuned in to Obama 's White House press conference from the combined ratings of NBC , ABC and CBS .

Richard Phillips , the captain of the Maersk Alabama who was held hostage by Somali pirates , did n't realize he was being rescued by the US navy until he heard an American accent . 
`` I did n't know what happened , '' Phillips said in an interview with NBC 's Matt Lauer . 
`` I can tell you what I thought happened . 
But I did n't think it had anything to do with military I thought it was a disagreement . '' 
`` For me it felt like five minutes . 
It was probably seven , eight seconds . 
I have no idea . 
Time was fractured for me . 
So it felt very long for me . 
It probably indeed was n't , '' Phillips said . 
The captain also reiterated the pirates never gained control of the Maersk Alabama and praised his crew : `` There were acts of heroism on the part of the crew . 
They got one of the pirates into some darkened space , stabbed him in the hand and overpowered him . 
Chief mate Shane Murphy was integral to them never getting control of the ship . '' 
Phillips talked about the days he was stuck on on the lifeboat : `` It was very , very hot on that lifeboat . 
You are soaked in sweat . 
When the sun came up , I sort of dreaded the sun because of the heat , and it would be up then for the next 12 to 13 hours . 
I looked forward to the sun going down . 
I am from Vermont . 
I like the cold weather . '' 
After the rescue , Phillips said he still could n't comprehend what had transpired : `` I was in elation and I was in limbo , away from the lifeboat -LRB- and -RRB- coming up next to the navy ship with some military people in the boat . 
I was still trying to get over what happened . '' 
The captain commended the commandos who rescued him : `` These Seals and the navy did an impossible job . 
They 're unbelievable people . 
We really owe it to the military for what they do day in and day out that we never even hear about . '' 
Phillips 's revealing interview came as Richard E Hicks , chief cook of the Maersk Alabama , filed a lawsuit against the companies that own the ship and provide the crew . 
Hicks alleges the businesses ignored requests to improve safety measures for vessels sailing along the Somali coast . 
As members of the media argue over the effectiveness of Barack Obama 's first 100 days in office , there 's one issue they probably all agree on . 
The president is a terrible gift giver . 
During Gordon Brown 's visit to Washington , Obama presented the PM with a box set of 25 DVDs . 
Michelle Obama also committed a gaffe when she gave the Brown children , Fraser and John , two toy models of Marine One after Sarah Brown carefully picked out Top Shop dresses and books by British authors for the Obama daughters . 
When the president made a trip to the UK for the G20 summit , he gave the Queen an iPod . 
And now we learn the Obamas have resorted to giving magazines to the school his daughters are attending . 
MSNBC is reporting the only items the Obamas gave to Sidwell Friends school for a fundraiser are a signed copy of a Rolling Stone magazine featuring the president and the January edition of Vogue with the first lady 's signature . 
Members of the school are disappointed with the gift and recall Bill Clinton 's donation when daughter Chelsea attended : a round of golf with the then president that brought in nearly $ 100,000 . 
As the milestone of Barack Obama 's first 100 days approaches on Wednesday , we are asking readers to send a message to the president by uploading a photo to our Flickr group . 
Following Obama 's historic election , readers have sent over 1,000 images to the group with messages ranging from the humorous ...

2009-04-27,"HONG KONG | Mon Apr 27 , 2009 12:43 am EDT HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Chinese virologist who helped fight SARS and bird flu warned on Monday of a possible swine flu pandemic that the most populous countries in Asia , China and India , would be ill-prepared to handle . 
`` We are counting down to a pandemic , '' said Guan Yi , a professor at the University of Hong Kong who helped trace the outbreak of SARS in 2003 to the civet cat . 
`` I think the spread of this virus in humans can not possibly be contained within a short time ... there are already cases in almost every region . 
The picture is changing every moment . '' 
Guan , who has been studying and tracking the spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus ever since it was discovered in people in Hong Kong in 1997 , said there would be `` many problems '' if swine flu reached China and India , `` where populations are so dense and health infrastructure is still insufficient . '' 
The virus , which carries swine , avian and human DNA and the designation H1N1 , has already killed up to 103 people in Mexico , infected 20 in the United States and six in Canada . 
There are many questions surrounding this virus , such as why it appears milder in the United States and deadlier in Mexico . 
`` It may seem weaker for now in the United States , but we do not know if it will get more virulent when it goes to another place as it mutates constantly , '' said Guan . 
`` When it goes into a place like China , there will be very high transmissibility among people . '' 
Microbes like viruses mutate all the time and can swap or mix DNA with other viruses they come into contact with . 
And nobody knows whether they could become more or less deadly , experts say . 
Guan said the swine flu virus was very different from the seasonal human H1N1 flu virus . 
`` It is almost a new subtype , '' he said , adding that as it was already transmitting efficiently among people , the world already had a pandemic on its hands . 
Currently the World Health Organisation classifies the virus as a `` public health emergency of international concern '' that could become a pandemic , or global outbreak of serious disease . 
`` This is what I am very worried about . 
The WHO is always very cautious -LRB- about raising its alert system -RRB- but it is wasting time , '' Guan added . 
The current phase of alert is 3 on a scale of 1 to 6 . 
A full-blown pandemic , level 6 , denotes sustained human to human spread over many countries of a new and serious virus .

2009-04-27,"NEW YORK | Mon Apr 27 , 2009 11:34 pm BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fears that an outbreak of swine flu could become a pandemic brought a new threat to the global economy on Monday , just as some economic indicators appeared to be bottoming out . 
Mexicans returned to work in large numbers after the weekend , despite worries over a virus that has killed up to 149 people there , and spread to the United States , Canada and Europe , but economists have warned that a global outbreak of deadly flu would seriously curtail economic activity . 
The World Bank estimated in 2008 that a flu pandemic could cost $ 3 trillion -LRB- 2 trillion pounds -RRB- and result in a nearly 5 percent drop in world gross domestic product . 
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS , which disrupted travel , trade and workplaces in 2003 , cost the Asia Pacific region an estimated $ 40 billion . 
It lasted six months and killed 775 of the 8,000 people it infected in 25 countries . 
The current flu outbreak tempered optimism that the global downturn could be starting to slow after governments committed trillions of dollars to interventions and stimulus . 
`` We almost have to wait to see not so much the contagion aspect but how deadly is this , '' said Alan Ruskin , chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich , Connecticut . 
While a mild strain may have a limited impact , `` if you start getting a number of fatalities , then it ramps the issue up substantially at every level , from a human standpoint and from an economic standpoint , '' he said . 
In Washington , the Obama administration said it was too soon to determine the potential economic impact but U.S. Treasury officials were monitoring the situation . 
Regardless of the effect of the virus on the global economy , International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he did not see a global economic recovery before 2010 . 
Strauss-Kahn told CNBC television he hoped the worst was over but that `` green shoots '' in the global economy were mostly in the United States . 
A Reuters survey of analysts across European and the United States taken April 21-27 found a slim majority saying the bottom had yet to be hit in the worst global recession since World War Two . 
The vast bulk of them said the crisis would last anywhere from six months to another two years . 
`` Financial and macroeconomic stability are still some way off and we do n't yet have the foundation for a solid recovery , '' said Lena Komileva , chief G7 market economist at interdealer broker Tullett Prebon . 
Mexico 's peso dropped more than 4 percent and U.S. stocks fell in volatile trading as investors fretted about the flu outbreak . 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.6 percent . 
European shares recovered from early losses , with the FTSEurofirst 300 index closing up 0.4 percent . 
Airline and leisure-related stocks were hit by fears the outbreak would hurt travel but drug makers rose on hopes the virus would result in strong vaccine sales . 
Separately , General Motors Corp said it would close plants , eliminate brands and exchange $ 27 billion of bonds for equity in a last ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy and earn continued government support . 
Despite risks of more financial turbulence , European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said lowering interest rates is not necessarily the best way to fight a recession . 
`` Our actions have been different from those taken by other central banks , reflecting differences in economic and financial structures , '' he said of the ECB 's reaction to the crisis in a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York . 
`` Indeed , given the different economic structures , they need to be different to reach the same objective . '' 
The ECB meets on May 7 and markets expect it to cut the benchmark interest rate from 1.25 percent to 1.0 percent . 
The U.S. Federal Reserve starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday and is expected to leave benchmark rates at or near zero . 
Earlier , other European Central Bank policymakers suggested further reductions in the main refinancing rate but differed as to how far they should go . 
The delicate state of the global economy was underlined by the Japanese government , which cut its economic forecasts on Monday , saying gross domestic product would shrink 3.3 percent over the next year . 
The Bank of Japan is expected to keep interest rates near zero when it meets on Thursday but has maintained a cautious view on the global outlook . 
BOJ Governor Masaaki Sharakawa has signalled the BOJ 's monthly policy review will predict a gradual recovery towards the end of this year or early in 2010 .

2009-04-27,"Mon Apr 27 , 2009 9:17 pm BST -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- revised Monday its 6-point scale for pandemic alerts , saying that phase 5 would correspond to a strong signal that a pandemic was `` imminent . '' 
The revised scale was published ahead of a decision by an advisory body of experts on whether to raise the alert level from the current level of 3 . 
WHO uses a series of six phases of pandemic alert as a system for informing the world of the seriousness of the threat and the need to launch progressively more intense preparations and measures . 
Margaret Chan , director-general of the United Nations agency in Geneva , is charged with deciding on when to move from one phase to another . 
Her decision is based on advice from international public health experts who held an emergency meeting Monday . 
The WHO emergency committee is assessing the risk from a swine flu outbreak that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and spread across the world . 
The current phase of alert is 3 , on a scale of 1 to 6 . 
A full-blown pandemic , level 6 , denotes sustained , human-to-human spread over many countries of a new and serious virus . 
Here are details of the six phases : No animal influenza virus circulating among animals is reported to cause infection in animals . 
Animal influenza virus is known to have caused infection in humans and is therefore a potential pandemic threat Animal or human-animal influenza virus causes sporadic cases or clusters of cases in people , but no human-to-human transmission , except in specific circumstances Human to human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza virus able to sustain community-level outbreaks `` The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic . '' 
\* PHASE 5 : The same virus causes sustained community-level outbreaks in two or more countries in one region `` While most countries will not be affected at this stage , the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization , communication , and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short . '' 
The virus causes sustained community-level outbreaks in more than one region `` Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way . '' 
Pandemic levels dropping below peak levels , but countries need to be prepared for a second wave .

2009-04-27,"-LRB- Repeats to more subscribers without changes in text -RRB- SINGAPORE , April 27 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As fears grow about whether a new dangerous strain of swine flu will develop into a global pandemic and affect economies , Asia can look to the 2003 SARS epidemic for pointers on what might happen . 
In 2003 , Asia was feeling the effects of the October 2002 Bali bombings , a tentative world recovery was underway from the bursting of the technology bubble and there was conflict in Iraq . 
Likewise today , other factors , such as job and income losses from the credit crisis , could make it difficult to isolate the effects of any swine flu outbreak . 
But SARS provides the last main point of reference in how the world dealt with a pandemic that was spread by human-to-human contact and how it affected economies and markets . 
Here are some questions and answers about the severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS , crisis : WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF SARS ON ASIA ? 
The World Health Organisation declared SARS a pandemic in March 2003 . 
By June of that year , it had lifted an advisory warning against traveling to SARS affected countries . 
There were some 8,000 cases and close to 800 deaths . 
The most visible impact of SARS was on tourism and consumption patterns in the most affected countries : Singapore , Hong Kong , China and Malaysia , although others in the region also suffered . 
Singapore and Hong Kong slipped into recession in 2003 . 
Other countries affected by SARS included Canada , South Africa , Sweden , France and the United States . 
Deaths were reported in Asia , Canada , France and South Africa . 
According to the Asian Development Bank , the cost of SARS in terms of lost GDP in nominal terms for East and Southeast Asia was about $ 18 billion or 0.6 percentage points of 2003 GDP . 
The main channels through which SARS affected economies was through tourist arrivals . 
ADB data shows a 20-70 percent drop on tourist arrivals in April 2003 in the most affected economies , while others in Asia also saw declines of 15-35 percent , leading to estimated tourism revenue losses of nearly $ 15 billion or 0.5 percent of GDP . 
SARS-affected economies experienced drops in retail sales growth in the order of 5-10 percent in early 2003 . 
Hong Kong 's economy shrank 2.6 percent and Singapore 's by 2 percent in the first half of 2003 . 
Overall growth was ironically helped by a simultaneous decline in imports and investment . 
HOW DID MARKETS REACT TO SARS ? 
Market reaction was relatively muted , possibly because the panic over SARS lasted for just about one quarter and governments reacted quickly . 
The Singapore dollar SGD = fell nearly 4 percent against the U.S. dollar between the end of January 2003 and the end of April 2003 , but it then rallied . 
MCSI 's emerging Asia-ex-Japan index . 
MIAPJ0000PUS fell around 14 percent between January and March 2003 . 
From the end of March it rallied by 56 percent during the rest of the year Hong Kong 's benchmark index . 
HSI shed 18 percent of its value between December 2002 and April 2003 , bottoming at a 4-year low . 
For a graphic on economic and market impact , click here : China had price controls for SARS-related drugs , tax waivers for affected industries such as hotels , interest subsidies for tourism sectors . 
Hong Kong 's government announced a package of measures worth around 1 percent of GDP , which included tax reductions and loan guarantees . 
Singapore likewise had a SARS relief package including measures for airlines . 
It also eased monetary policy in July 2003 by a one-off devaluation of the currency . 
Malaysia 's package was close to 2 percent of GDP and included cheaper loans , support for job training and tourism sectors . 
IS THE ECONOMIC SITUATION DIFFERENT NOW ? 
The starting point for most economies is much lower , since the credit crisis has already plunged a lot of the developed world and countries such as Singapore , Japan and Hong Kong into recession . 
Tourism received a big boost between 2004 and 2007 and is now a much bigger contributor to growth , with revenues comprising between 6 and 9 percent of GDP in Hong Kong , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore .

2009-04-27,"After SARS and bird flu , Asia wary of new virus HONG KONG | Mon Apr 27 , 2009 7:16 am EDT HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Asia battled SARS and H5N1 bird flu in 2003 and has improved its health infrastructure but there is a wide gulf in how prepared countries in the region are to fight swine flu . 
Countries around the world have moved to contain the spread of a possible pandemic after a new swine flu outbreak killed 103 people in Mexico . 
Twenty cases have been identified in the United States and six in Canada , with no deaths reported . 
Possible cases are being checked as far afield as New Zealand . 
`` With SARS and H5N1 , there was a lot of impetus to improve preparedness in many countries in Asia , but there is still a huge variation in preparedness , '' said Malik Peiris , a virologist and professor at the University of Hong Kong . 
Densely populated cities in developing countries such as China or India would encounter major problems , said Guan Yi , a Chinese virologist at the University of Hong Kong who helped fight SARS and bird flu and trace their sources in the past . 
`` If it goes to China or India , where populations are very dense and infrastructure is not enough , there will be many problems , '' Guan said . 
`` We are counting down to a pandemic . '' 
Health experts are also worried about impoverished countries such as Laos , Cambodia and Myanmar , which have rudimentary public health systems , meaning a delay in reporting cases and risking the spread of outbreaks . 
Since SARS and H5N1 swept through Asia in 2003 , governments around the region have beefed up disease surveillance systems , built hospital isolation units and maintained stockpiles of Tamiflu , a drug that appears effective against the new virus . 
However there are still big discrepancies between countries . 
While many dead birds found in Hong Kong are routinely tested for diseases like H5N1 , that would be hardly be possible in sprawling countries like China or India . 
Sophisticated laboratories have been set up in Hong Kong and even Indonesia , which has four such facilities . 
In Thailand , there are flu monitoring systems in place in the countryside , a legacy from battling H5N1 . 
However , experts are jittery because such facilities are scarce and there are many questions surrounding the new virus . 
`` Indonesia has prepared a system in case of a flu pandemic . 
But there is something I am not certain of , the early warning , reporting and action system , '' said I Gusti Ngurah Mahardika , a virologist at Udayana University in Indonesia . 
`` The laboratories and government research institute are of course ready , but the question is , do the rest -LRB- in the country -RRB- have the early diagnostic -LRB- systems -RRB- already ? '' 
`` I am trying to find out about the H1N1 that spread in Mexico and California , why is it new ? 
How is it connected to swine ? '' 
Thailand strengthened its pandemic preparedness after an initial slow response to bird flu in 2003 , and health experts say it now has a `` robust '' surveillance system , improved laboratory facilities and better training . 
Health Minister Witthaya Kaewparadai said 14 medical centers were capable of tackling an outbreak of swine flu . 
Another six mobile units were on standby to handle remote outbreaks . 
`` It will take us four hours to verify suspected cases , '' Witthaya said , adding Thailand had enough Tamiflu stockpiled in the country to treat 300,000 patients , and the government drug maker can produce more if necessary . 
"
2009-04-27,"MEXICO CITY | Mon Apr 27 , 2009 3:10 am BST MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fears of a global flu pandemic grew as new suspected cases of a dangerous new strain of swine flu appeared around the world . 
It has killed up to 81 people in Mexico and spread to the United States and Canada . 
Here are some questions and answers about the outbreak : HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED ? 
HOW MANY ARE INFECTED ? 
All the fatalities have been in Mexico , where the government is reporting at least 20 and up to 81 deaths from the flu virus . 
Most of the dead are between 25 and 45 -- the age group past pandemics have tended to strike . 
Mexican officials said , however , that most of the 1,300 suspected cases were found not to have swine flu . 
In the United States , the flu has infected 20 people in California , Kansas , Texas , New York and Ohio . 
Canada has confirmed six cases . 
Possible infections have also been detected in Spain , France and New Zealand . 
WHAT KIND OF FLU IS IT AND HOW IS IT SPREADING ? 
The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 and is spreading from person to person . 
It contains DNA from avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention . 
It is passed on by sneezing , coughing or when people pick up the virus from their hands . 
It likely originated in pigs , but the Mexican government and the World Health Organisation have ruled out any risk of infection from eating pork . 
The Geneva-based WHO has declared the flu a `` public health emergency of international concern . '' 
It poses the biggest risk of a large-scale pandemic since avian flu re-emerged in 2003 , killing 257 out of 421 infected in 15 countries . 
The Mexican government is stressing that it can be treated and it has one million doses of antiviral drugs . 
HOW IS THIS FLU DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY FLU ? 
The swine flu is characterized by common flu symptoms -- sudden fever , muscle aches , sore throat and dry cough -- but may cause more severe vomiting and diarrhoea . 
Common seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year , often targeting the elderly . 
Most people die from pneumonia and flu can kill previously healthy people for reasons no one quite understands . 
It can also worsen bacterial infections . 
New flu strains can spread fast because no one has natural immunity and a vaccine can take months to develop . 
This new strain of swine flu is genetically different from the H1N1 virus that the seasonal flu vaccine protects against . 
HOW BAD COULD IT GET ? 
A 1968 a `` Hong Kong '' flu pandemic killed about one million people globally . 
In a 1918 `` Spanish '' flu pandemic between 40 million and 100 million people died . 
However , the WHO says the world is now better prepared to withstand a flu pandemic . 
WHAT MEASURES IS THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TAKING ? 
Mexico has closed all schools in the capital and two central states until May 6 and stopped hundreds of public events in Mexico City , including concerts . 
Mexico City has shut 70 percent of its bars and nightclubs , closed churches and cinemas , and the army is handing out surgical face masks on the street . 
The government is recommending people avoid crowded places and refrain from greetings like shaking hands , kissing or hugging . 
People have been told to wash their hands frequently and avoid sharing food or kitchenware . 
It has also issued an emergency decree that gives it the power to isolate sick people , enter homes or workplaces and regulate air , sea and land transportation to try to stop further infection . 
The government has even extended the deadline on filing tax returns by a month to the end of May . 
WHAT IS THE REST OF THE WORLD DOING TO HELP ? 
The U.S. government is monitoring developments and the CDC and the WHO are working on a vaccine . 
The WHO has activated a command and control center for acute public health events nicknamed the `` war room . '' 
It says it is ready to use rapid containment measures if needed , including antivirals . 
The WHO has a stockpile of 5 million treatment courses of the antiviral Tamiflu , by Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG and Gilead Sciences Inc , and of Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKline , which have both proven effective against the virus . 
Countries and regions also have antiviral supplies and the United States has released 25 percent of its 50-million course stockpile of the two drugs . 
SHOULD TOURISTS WITH TRIPS PLANNED TO MEXICO BE WORRIED ? 
The CDC and the WHO say there is no need to alter travel plans and Mexico has said it saw no need to close its borders .

The company was able to state the likelihood of H1N1 outbreaks based on its patented Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- genomics technology , which examines specific regions in virus genes which have been linked with past epidemics . 
The April 2008 announcement , attached below as published on the Web , stated that in H1N1 the company had then detected the highest concentrations of these specific regions ever seen , except for those from the 1918 pandemic which killed millions of people . 
Today , the company is actively pursuing licensing partnerships to apply its groundbreaking technology not only to early warning systems , but also to the development of synthetic vaccines to prevent or slow future epidemics . 
A synthetic H1N1 Replikins Vaccine is available for testing . 
A similar synthetic Replikin Vaccine has been shown to successfully block the entry of H5N1 virus into , replication in , and excretion from chickens . 
The company is able to produce these vaccines in as little as 7 days , rather than the many months needed for traditional vaccines , because they are synthesized at the peptide level . 
The following is the text of the April 2008 release in which Replikins was able to pinpoint the high risk of H1N1 outbreaks : -- H1N1 Influenza Virus with Highest Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- Since the 1918 Pandemic Identified in the U.S. and Austria Boston , MA -LRB- PRWeb -RRB- April 7 , 2008 -- Replikins , Ltd. has found that the Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- of the H1N1 strain of influenza virus has recently increased to 7.6 -LRB- plus\/minus 1.4 -RRB- , its highest level since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic -LRB- p value less than 0.001 -RRB- . 
A rising Replikin Count of a particular influenza strain , indicating rapid replication of the virus , is an early warning which has been followed consistently by an outbreak of the specific strain . 
The current increase appears to be specific to H1N1 ; there was a concurrent 80 % decline in the Replikin Count of H3N2 , for instance . 
The current H1N1 appears to be rapidly replicating simultaneously in the U.S. and Austria . 
It may succeed H5N1 as the leading candidate for the next expected overdue pandemic . 
However , the same virus replikin structures detected by FluForecast -LRB- R -RRB- software in all three previous pandemics , namely 1918 H1N1 , 1957 H2N2 , and 1968 H3N2 , as well as in H5N1 , have not yet been detected in the currently evolving H1N1 . 
There is evidence that many factors , including virus structure , host receptivity , and the environment , together with infectivity and rapid replication , need to converge for a pandemic to occur . 
For H5N1 , the high human mortality rate , which peaked at over 80 % in 2006-07 in Indonesia , as well as current low infectivity , both appear to limit H5N1 's ability to produce a pandemic . 
Furthermore , the H5N1 rapid replication cycle which began in 1996 now appears to be over . 
The H5N1 virus produced less than 300 World Health Organization confirmed deaths over the past 10 years . 
On the other hand , H1N1 , with an estimated human mortality rate of only 2.5 to 10 % , but with much higher infectivity , produced an estimated 50 million deaths in the 1918 pandemic . 
A number of countermeasures exist today which did not exist in 1918 , however . 
Among these is Replikins ' ability to manufacture synthetic vaccines based on current sequences , with a seven day production turnaround . 
-LRB- end of 4\/2008 release -RRB- In the April 2008 announcement above , as published on the Web , Replikins stated that it had detected the highest levels of its specific genome regions ever seen in any virus samples , except for those from the 1918 pandemic which killed tens of millions of people . 
Today , the company is actively pursuing licensing partnerships to apply its groundbreaking technology not only to early warning systems , but also to the development of synthetic vaccines to prevent or slow future epidemics .

2009-04-28,"Swine flu outbreak reaches Europe The UN has warned that the virus has the potential to become a pandemic The first cases of swine flu have been confirmed in Europe . 
Two British people admitted to hospital in Scotland after returning from a holiday in Mexico have been confirmed as having the virus . 
In Spain , a man has tested positive for swine flu and 17 other people are under investigation , officials said . 
EU health ministers are to meet on Thursday to discuss the outbreak , which health officials suspect has killed about 150 people in Mexico . 
The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- raised its alert level late on Tuesday from three to four - two steps short of declaring a full pandemic . 
Personally , I 'd try to avoid non-essential travel to the areas which are reported to be in the center of the cluster WHO Assistant Director General Dr Keiji Fukuda said it signalled a `` significant step towards pandemic influenza '' , but added `` we are not there yet '' . 
The EU 's Health Commissioner , Androulla Vassiliou , has advised against non-essential travel to any affected areas . 
Besides Mexico , the UK and Spain , there have also been confirmed cases in the US and Canada . 
Suspected cases are being investigated in Brazil , Israel , Australia and New Zealand . 
`` Personally , I 'd try to avoid non-essential travel to the areas which are reported to be in the center of the cluster , '' Ms Vassiliou said . 
The precaution would `` minimize the personal risk and to reduce the potential risk to spread the infection to other people '' , she added . 
Germany 's largest tour operator , TUI , suspended all trips to Mexico City as a precaution - though holidays to other parts of Mexico would continue as normal . 
Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said both UK patients were recovering well in a Lanarkshire hospital from mild cases of the virus . 
Swine flu is a respiratory disease thought to spread through coughing and sneezing Symptoms mimic those of normal flu - but in Mexico more than 100 people have died Good hygiene like using a tissue and washing hands thoroughly can help reduce transmission `` The threat to the public remains low , '' she said . 
`` The precautionary actions we have taken over the last two days have been important in allowing us to respond appropriately and give us the best prospect of disrupting the spread of the virus . '' 
There are 14 other possible cases currently being investigated in the UK , though all the people involved are well enough to be managed in the community , British Health Secretary Alan Johnson said . 
In Madrid , Spanish Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez confirmed that a male patient in Almansa in the south-eastern province of Albacete had tested positive for the virus . 
The 23-year-old man had arrived home from Mexico with a fever last Wednesday , and was isolated in a hospital ward on Saturday night , she added . 
Ms Jimenez said his condition was not serious . 
At least 17 further suspected cases are under investigation in Spain , in locations ranging from Madrid to Mallorca , Barcelona to the Basque Country . 
The patients have all recently returned from Mexico . 
None of the cases is thought to be life threatening . 
Robert Madelin said it was clear that a ` novel ' flu virus was now being confronted Four people tested for the virus in France have been given the all-clear by doctors , French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot has said . 
The WHO has said the swine flu virus could be capable of mutating into a more dangerous strain , but officials say they need more information on the virus to determine the threat it poses . 
They are advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young adults , a characteristic of past pandemics . 
The H1N1 virus is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans , but the newly detected version contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds . 
There is currently no vaccine for the new strain , but severe cases can be treated with anti-viral medication . 
Earlier , the European Commission convened an emergency meeting of the health ministers from all the EU 's 27 member states on Thursday to discuss growing concern about the outbreak . 
Mexico : 20 confirmed cases -LRB- Mexico puts suspected deaths at 149 -RRB- United States : 40 confirmed cases Israel , Brazil , Guatemala , Peru , Australia and New Zealand : Suspected cases being tested `` The commission is following the situation concerning the swine influenza very closely , '' said Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso . 
`` We will continue to assess the information we are getting from the experts , evaluate the potential danger and decide together with member states on the measures to take . '' 
Further details about Thursday 's meeting have to be worked out by the Czech Republic , which currently holds the EU presidency . 
The commission 's director-general for health and consumer protection , Robert Madelin , said close co-ordination between EU members was the most effective way to tackle any pandemic . 
He said the EU was `` putting in place plans agreed in the last five years , ensuring that the level of risk management is appropriate to the risk - using our ` war-games ' experiences '' . 
"
2009-04-28,"Swine flu test center is set up Health experts say this strain of virus has been around for 30 years A 24-hour facility has been set up in Leicester to test for possible swine flu cases in the East Midlands . 
Swabs will be analyzed at the Leicester Royal Infirmary with results potentially available in four hours . 
The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- has said `` some '' people are being tested for the H1N1 virus in the East Midlands , including two in Derbyshire . 
Dr Roy Fey , from the HPA , said the two had been told to stay at home but stressed there was no need to panic . 
Dr Fey said : `` We 're doing tests . 
A lot of people have come back from Mexico over the Easter holidays and around the country . 
There have been calls to our different health protection units - that is how the people in Scotland were detected . 
`` We are not taking people into hospital unless they need hospital care - we are taking swabs from them to see if they have the virus or not . 
`` Outside of Mexico all of the cases have seen people fall mildly ill , almost like seasonal flu , the H1N1 virus is something that has been around for 30-odd years . '' 
People are being told not to panic Dr Phillip Monk from the HPA said people with symptoms should seek medical advice . 
`` The most important thing is to contact your general practitioner , the second thing is isolate yourself - do n't spread anything you 've got around other people . 
You will be told by your general practitioner and by us what to do next . '' 
The UK 's first swine flu cases have been confirmed as honeymooners Iain and Dawn Askham , of Polmont , near Falkirk . 
The World Health Organisation has raised its alert level to four - two steps short of declaring a pandemic . 
Level four means the virus is showing a sustained ability to pass from human to human , and is able to cause community-level outbreaks . 
"
2009-04-28,"Swine flu : How serious a threat ? 
The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was caused by an H1N1 form of influenza A With the UK confirming two cases of swine flu and the World Health Organization raising its alert level from three to four , how serious a threat does the disease pose to us all ? 
WHO says the virus , which has killed an estimated 150 people in Mexico , is showing a `` sustained ability '' to pass from human to human and is able to cause community-level outbreaks . 
The UK 's leading experts on flu give their views on what the future threat might be . 
PROFESSOR NEIL FERGUSON , WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION Clearly we are on track for a pandemic in the coming months . 
The good news is that we were all worried about so-called bird flu H5N1 which was a much more dangerous virus . 
Here , we are not in the same ball park . 
We might expect up to 30-40 % of the population to become ill in the next six months if this truly turns into a pandemic But we ca n't at the moment answer the question is it comparable to 1918 Spanish flu which killed a lot of people - or is it much more like Hong Kong flu . 
We are coming out of the normal time of year when we have flu circulating in the UK so we do n't really know what size of epidemic there may be in the next couple of months . 
It is almost certain that even if it does fade away in the next few weeks which it might we will get a sizable epidemic in the autumn . 
We might expect up to 30-40 % of the population to become ill in the next six months if this truly turns into a pandemic . 
We could get substantial numbers infected in the next few weeks . 
If I was to be a betting man I would say it would be a slightly longer period of time just because we are heading into the summer months . 
SIR LIAM DONALDSON , CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR ENGLAND A new strain of flu is something to which we do not have natural immunity , and we have not been vaccinated against , because there is not a vaccine , so it does mean that many more people are vulnerable and so it spreads more easily and affects more people . 
But we do n't know enough about this virus yet . 
It is being studied by the top laboratories in the world . 
When we know more about it we will be able to give better predictions about who is at greater risk , and who is at risk of developing serious complications . 
At this point the picture coming out of Mexico is rather confused , and we ca n't make any firm statements about what is likely to happen , but we have to prepare for all eventualities . 
PROFESSOR JOHN OXFORD , VIROLOGY EXPERT AT BARTS AND THE LONDON If the avian flu H5N1 virus had spread from human to human like this then I would be extremely worried . 
It would be top of my Richter scale . 
But this swine flu worries me less because as a population we have a basic immunity to H1N1 . 
Outside of Mexico there have been no deaths , so it does n't seem so aggressive . 
And not only are we coming up to the summer , which makes it less likely for these viruses to spread as well , but Britain has enough antiviral drugs for half of the population . 
So we should not panic in any way . 
This does not look as though it is going to be a virus that sweeps the world and causes huge mortality . 
DR ALAN MACNALLY , MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EXPERT AT NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY I still think we are a day or so away from knowing what the threat is . 
WHO has gone to stage four , so we know there will be an epidemic stemming from direct contact with these cases in Mexico . 
We will see more cases . 
But we will have to wait to see how it spreads to know if there will be a pandemic that sweeps nations . 
The key thing is how lethal a virus is it . 
Outside of Mexico it has not caused any deaths , which is good news . 
And we are prepared for it . 
We should have a complete picture in the next five to seven days to answer these questions . 
KEITH PLUMB , FELLOW OF THE INSTITUTION OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS There is no evidence of pandemic in Europe at this point in time but should the threat increase , the UK has a wealth of scientific and engineering expertise which can be deployed to ramp up the countermeasures necessary to protect the population at large . 
Let 's keep things in perspective . 
This is not 1918 ; and with over 30 million doses of antiviral treatments , effective against H1N1 available in the UK right now we are well placed to combat any outbreak . 
We should also bear in mind that there are two flu-vaccine manufacturers in the UK -LRB- Novartis and Medimmune -RRB- and whilst there may be capacity issues , both companies are technically capable of producing appropriate vaccines . 
PROFESSOR HUGH PENNINGTON , LEADING BACTERIOLOGIST It 's a new virus - we 've never before seen this combination of swine virus and human virus genes . 
It 's very difficult to make any predictions when it 's not like any flu virus before . 
If there are no more cases in the next couple of weeks then we can maybe say with reasonable confidence that we 're out of the woods . 
But the flu virus is a pretty awkward customer and you have to be very circumspect . 
I do n't think the public health authorities will be giving the all-clear for some time yet . 
PROFESSOR ANGUS NICOLL , EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL We have a very confusing picture coming out of Mexico . 
We are not aware of how many people there are with mild infections out of Mexico . 
It may be that those few deaths represent just the tip of an iceberg which is a lot more much milder infections . 
Therefore we feel that one should not be looking at Mexico and saying that is the pattern we will necessarily be following in Europe . 
We do know from previous influenza viruses and previous pandemics that what you see at the start is not necessarily what you see six months , a year or two years later . 
Sometimes you get a second or third wave which is more vicious than the first . 
As a region , Europe - and particularly the European Union - is better prepared than any other part of the world . 
Unfortunately you can never prepare well enough . 
We are beyond the stage of being able to contain the virus , we can only mitigate it and there is still more work to be done - and a cool summer would give us time to do some additional work .

2009-04-28,"HOW SWINE FLU OUTBREAK EMERGED Flu viruses mutate over time causing small changes to proteins on their surface called antigens . 
If the immune system has met a particular strain of the virus before , it is likely to have some immunity ; but if the antigens are new to the immune system , it will be weakened . 
The influenza A virus can mutate in two different ways ; antigenic drift , in which existing antigens are subtly altered , and antigenic shift , in which two or more strains combine . 
Antigenic drift causes slight flu mutations year on year , from which humans have partial , but not complete , immunity . 
By contrast , the new strain of H1N1 appears to have originated via antigenic shift in Mexican pigs The name `` swine flu '' is a slight misnomer as it is believed pigs acted as a mixing pot for several flu strains , containing genetic material from pigs , birds and humans . 
Most humans have never been exposed to some of the antigens involved in the new strain of flu , giving it the potential to cause a pandemic . 
The new virus has made the jump from pigs to humans and has demonstrated it can also pass from human to human . 
This is why it is demanding so much attention from health authorities . 
The virus passes from human to human like other types of flu , either through coughing , sneezing , or by touching infected surfaces , although little is known about how the virus acts on humans . 
BACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Swine flu is a respiratory disease , caused by influenza type A which infects pigs . 
There are many types , and the infection is constantly changing . 
Until now it has not normally infected humans , but the latest form clearly does , and can be spread from person to person - probably through coughing and sneezing . 
What is new about this type of swine flu ? 
The World Health Organization has confirmed that at least some of the human cases are a never-before-seen version of the H1N1 strain of influenza type A. Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu - but deaths recorded in Mexico It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Too early to say whether it will lead to a pandemic Current treatments do work , but there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised H1N1 is the same strain which causes seasonal outbreaks of flu in humans on a regular basis . 
But this latest version of H1N1 is different : it contains genetic material that is typically found in strains of the virus that affect humans , birds and swine . 
Flu viruses have the ability to swap genetic components with each other , and it seems likely that the new version of H1N1 resulted from a mixing of different versions of the virus , which may usually affect different species , in the same animal host . 
Pigs provide an excellent ` melting pot ' for these viruses to mix and match with each other . 
Symptoms of swine flu in humans appear to be similar to those produced by standard , seasonal flu . 
These include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue . 
Most cases so far reported around the world appear to be mild , but in Mexico lives have been lost . 
How worried should people be ? 
When any new strain of flu emerges that acquires the ability to pass from person to person , it is monitored very closely in case it has the potential to spark a global epidemic , or pandemic . 
1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times . 
Caused by a form of the H1N1 strain of flu , it is estimated that up to 40 % of the world 's population were infected , and more than 50 million people died , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people . 
Caused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks . 
The impact of the pandemic was minimized by rapid action by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccine available speedily . 
The elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die The World Health Organization has warned that taken together the Mexican and US cases could potentially trigger a global pandemic , and stress that the situation is serious . 
However , experts say it is still too early to accurately assess the situation fully . 
Currently , they say the world is closer to a flu pandemic than at any point since 1968 - rating the threat at four on a six-point scale . 
Nobody knows the full potential impact of a pandemic , but experts have warned that it could cost millions of lives worldwide . 
The Spanish flu pandemic , which began in 1918 , and was also caused by an H1N1 strain , killed millions of people . 
The fact that all the cases in the US and elsewhere have so far produced mild symptoms is encouraging . 
It suggests that the severity of the Mexican outbreak may be due to an unusual geographically-specific factor - possibly a second unrelated virus circulating in the community - which would be unlikely to come into play in the rest of the world . 
Alternatively , people infected in Mexico may have sought treatment at a much later stage than those in other countries . 
It may also be the case that the form of the virus circulating in Mexico is subtly different to that elsewhere - although that will only be confirmed by laboratory analysis . 
There is also hope that , as humans are often exposed to forms of H1N1 through seasonal flu , our immune systems may have something of a head start in fighting infection . 
However , the fact that many of the victims are young does point to something unusual . 
Normal , seasonal flu tends to affect the elderly disproportionately . 
Can the virus be contained ? 
The virus appears already to have started to spread around the world , and most experts believe that containment of the virus in the era of readily available air travel will be extremely difficult . 
The US authorities say that two drugs commonly used to treat flu , Tamiflu and Relenza , seem to be effective at treating cases that have occurred there so far . 
However , the drugs must be administered at an early stage to be effective . 
Use of these drugs may also make it less likely that infected people will pass the virus on to others . 
The UK Government already has a stockpile of Tamiflu , ordered as a precaution against a pandemic . 
It is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains . 
US scientists are already developing a bespoke new vaccine , but it may take some time to perfect it , and manufacture enough supplies to meet what could be huge demand . 
A vaccine was used to protect humans from a version of swine flu in the US in 1976 . 
However , it caused serious side effects , including an estimated 500 cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome . 
There were more deaths from the vaccine than the outbreak . 
What should I do to stay safe ? 
Anyone with flu-like symptoms who might have been in contact with the swine virus - such as those living or traveling in the areas of Mexico that have been affected - should seek medical advice . 
But patients are being asked not to go into GP surgeries in order to minimize the risk of spreading the disease to others . 
Instead , they should stay at home and call their healthcare provider for advice . 
After the WHO raised its alert level over swine flu , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office began advising against all but essential travel to Mexico . 
What measures can I take to prevent infection ? 
Avoid close contact with people who appear unwell and who have fever and cough . 
General infection control practices and good hygiene can help to reduce transmission of all viruses , including the human swine influenza . 
This includes covering your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing , using a tissue when possible and disposing of it promptly . 
It is also important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water to reduce the spread of the virus from your hands to face or to other people and cleaning hard surfaces like door handles frequently using a normal cleaning product . 
If caring for someone with a flu-like illness , a mask can be worn to cover the nose and mouth to reduce the risk of transmission . 
The UK is looking at increasing its stockpile of masks for healthcare workers for this reason . 
But experts say there is no scientific evidence to support more general wearing of masks to guard against infections . 
Is it safe to eat pig meat ? 
There is no evidence that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals . 
However , it is essential to cook meat properly . 
A temperature of 70C -LRB- 158F -RRB- would be sure to kill the virus . 
The strain of bird flu which has caused scores of human deaths in South East Asia in recent years is a different strain to that responsible for the current outbreak of swine flu . 
The latest form of swine flu is a new type of the H1N1 strain , while bird , or avian flu , is H5N1 . 
Experts fear H5N1 hold the potential to trigger a pandemic because of its ability to mutate rapidly . 
However , up until now it has remained very much a disease of birds . 
Those humans who have been infected have , without exception , worked closely with birds , and cases of human-to-human transmission are extremely rare - there is no suggestion that H5N1 has gained the ability to pass easily from person to person . 
Where can I get further advice ? 
Further information and advice on swine flu can be found at websites of leading health and research organizations around the world . 
The World Health Organisation gives background information on the virus . 
The UK 's Health Protection Agency advises the public about what to do if returning from an affected area . 
NHS Choices outlines how swine flu is different from other flu . 
The US government 's Centre for Disease Control is counting the number of cases in the US .

Trouble began yesterday when a health minister in Israel raised an objection to '' swine flu '' on the grounds of Jewish and Muslim sensitivities over pork . 
Yakov Litzman , a member of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community , came up with his own alternative : `` Mexican flu . '' 
That had the advantage of sparing Jews and Muslims discomfort . 
It had the disadvantage , however , of causing Mexicans even greater discomfort . 
Mexico 's ambassador to Israel , Frederico Salas , was duly dispatched to register an official complaint over the suggestion . 
The move prompted a hurried retraction from the Israeli government , which insisted it had no intention of changing the name . 
If the virus is not , after all , to mutate into `` Mexican flu '' , what then is it to be called ? 
Swine flu looks likely to hold for the time being , though as it changes and spreads its connection to pigs will become increasingly tenuous . 
The European commission is calling it the `` novel flu virus '' , which as a description is accurate but will also become redundant as time passes . 
Which leaves the medical nomenclature as the certain front-runner to become the household reference to the new virus . 
`` Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus , human '' . 
The label may well catch on . 
It 's snappy , has a ring to it , and most importantly offends precisely no one . 
Governments debate ` swine flu ' versus ` Mexican flu ' This article was published on guardian .

2009-04-28,"Prepare for swine flu pandemic , WHO warns Health chiefs say plans to fight swine flu pandemic needed now , especially in developing world Tuesday 28 April 2009 17.37 BST The world should prepare for a possible swine flu pandemic , especially in developing nations which could be hit particularly hard by the virus , the World Health Organisation warned today . 
The apparently new strain of the H1N1 flu , which seemingly originated in Mexico , has now been confirmed in seven countries , including the UK , New Zealand and Israel , with suspected outbreaks investigated in a number of others . 
It has shown an apparent ability to transfer from person to person , making its rapid global threat `` a very serious possibility '' , said the WHO 's deputy head , Keiji Fukuda . 
`` Countries should take the opportunity to prepare for a pandemic , '' Fukuda told reporters in Geneva , while stressing that a pandemic was not yet inevitable . 
Special efforts should be made towards less rich nations which `` really get hit disproportionately hard '' by pandemics , he said . 
Patrick Wintour on UK preparations for swine flu outbreak Link to this audio Fukuda confirmed the WHO was investigating whether human-to-human transmission had been identified in a group of New York City school students who are believed to have passed the virus among themselves after returning from a trip to Mexico . 
Such apparent cross-infection was the reason why the organization 's emergency committee last night raised its pandemic threat level to phase four out of a possible six , meaning a pandemic was possible , Fukuda said . 
`` We think that the virus showed the ability to transfer from person to person - this was an important step , '' Fukuda said . 
Any evidence of `` sustained human-to-human transmission in a number of different countries '' would see the alert raised to five , he said . 
The vast majority of about 2,000 cases have been identified in Mexico , with 51 in the US and 15 combined in the UK , Canada , New Zealand , Spain and Israel . 
Eight more countries , including France , Germany and Denmark and South Korea , are investigating possible outbreaks . 
A Scottish couple , who had been on honeymoon in Canc n , Mexico , remain in hospital but their condition is improving , the Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said . 
`` I am pleased to say they are continuing to improve . 
They 're doing well , '' she said . 
All the 150-plus deaths from the swine flu have been recorded in Mexico , with patients in other countries experiencing far less severe symptoms . 
Fukuda , however , cautioned against the idea that the outbreak could be a `` mild pandemic '' , noting that the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak which killed tens of millions of people worldwide came in a series of increasingly lethal waves . 
`` I think we have to be mindful and respectful of the fact that influenza moves in ways we can not predict , '' he said . 
Dr Alan McNally of Nottingham Trent University on the spread and science of swine flu Link to this audio In the UK , the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to Mexico as major tour operators including Thomas Cook and Airtours canceled flights to the country and sent out empty planes to repatriate holidaymakers . 
A spokesman for NHS Direct said the advice line had received almost 1,400 calls about suspected swine flu cases . 
In the past 24 hours , it has referred 238 callers who had traveled to infected areas and were showing potential symptoms of the virus to their GPs . 
The Wiltshire primary care trust said seven people from the county were being tested for suspected swine flu at a Health Protection Agency facility in Bristol , with results expected later today . 
Gordon Brown , who later today will join a meeting of the government 's Cobra emergency committee , chaired by the health secretary , Alan Johnson , called for concerted global action to combat the virus . 
`` Swine flu is an international problem now . 
It is across two continents , '' the prime minister said during a visit to Poland . 
The European commission is to hold a meeting with representatives from the pharmaceutical industry tomorrow to discuss how a vaccine might be produced , the EU health commissioner , Androulla Vasiliou , said in Brussels . 
It could take between four and six months to produce a vaccine , although anti-flu drugs already available appear to be at least partly effective in treating symptoms . 
The 11 cases in New Zealand , among students and teachers from a single school who reported fevers and other flu symptoms on return from a visit to Mexico , are the first in the Asia-Pacific region . 
South Korea is also investigating a probable case . 
Spain , meanwhile , confirmed a second case . 
Officials in China , where some cases of bird flu and another virulent respiratory infection , Sars , were initially covered up in recent years , say the country has not yet confirmed any cases but have promised full transparency . 
Two people were also confirmed as having contracted the virus in Israel , a 26-year-old who has recovered fully and a 47-year-old man who returned from Mexico two days ago . 
Health officials in Ireland said six people in the country were now being tested for possible exposure to the virus , which is a combination of pig , bird and human flu strains to which humans may have no natural immunity . 
Symptoms include a high fever and headache , coughing , joint ache and , in some cases , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
The deaths in Mexico have tended to be among people in their 30s or 40s rather than the very young or old , as is the case with usual flu strains . 
UK ministers say the country is well prepared for a possible pandemic , with Johnson telling MPs the country had a stock of 33m courses of anti-flu drugs . 
If the situation deteriorates , plans are in place for the government to warn the entire population to set up a support network of friends and relatives so they can be quickly quarantined at home if they are thought to have symptoms . 
The friends would collect medicine on their behalf . 
In Mexico , where officials in the capital , Mexico City , today ordered all restaurants to close , the country 's health secretary , Jos Angel C rdova , has said he expects more people to die . 
C rdova admitted that the health authorities lacked the staff to check on all suspected cases . 
Some foreign health officials fear such difficulties may be contributing to the disease 's spread . 
He stressed it was not confirmed the outbreak had begun in Mexico and indicated it could have first emerged in the US , where health officials believe the virus was spotted in late March . 
Peru and Guatemala reported the first suspected infections in other parts of Latin America , where health officials fear swine flu has already spread but has so far gone undetected .

Good news : antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir seem to be working . 
On the benefits of the drugs , the agency says : Treatment : If you get sick , antiviral drugs can make your illness milder and make you feel better faster . 
They may also prevent serious influenza complications . 
For treatment , antiviral drugs work best if started as soon after getting sick as possible , and might not work if started more than 48 hours after illness starts . 
Prevention : Influenza antiviral drugs also can be used to prevent influenza when they are given to a person who is not ill , but who has been or may be near a person with swine influenza . 
When used to prevent the flu , antiviral drugs are about 70 % to 90 % effective . 
When used for prevention , the number of days that they should be used will vary depending on a person 's particular situation .

CDC acting director Richard Besser said the US has confirmed 40 total cases in five US states , but says the only change from yesterday is an additional 20 cases at a New York City private school . 
He said the additional cases represent increased testing , rather than the spread of the virus . 
In a press conference happening now in Washington , Besser said that of the 40 cases , only a single patient was hospitalised . 
Others who were infected and sickened have since recovered . 
He notes the US has n't seen the severity that Mexico has suffered . 
Besser said the US state department would issue a travel advisory `` out of an abundance of caution '' , warning against non-essential travel to Mexico . 
Besser said businesses , schools , parents and religious institutions should formulate plans in case a worker , student or parishioner takes ill . 
Noting the disparity between the severity of Mexico cases and those in the US , Besser said Americans should not think the country has for some reason been spared . 
`` I would n't rest on the fact that we have only seen cases in this country that are less severe , '' he said . 
He said many factors could explain the discrepancy , and said that as health officials monitoring the US discover more cases , the range of severity is likely to `` broaden '' . 
Besser said he does not recommend widespread use of the surgical masks that were ubiquitous during the SARS outbreak in China and are even now in Mexico City . 
`` The evidence of their value outside of healthcare settings ... is not very strong , '' he said . 
Besser said people should not kiss one another in greeting -LRB- though he did not specifically proscribe more romantic smooches -RRB- , and advised people to wash their hands frequently and cover their mouths and noses when they cough and sneeze .

Yes , the swine flu could mutate and become more dangerous . 
It could spread farther and further . 
What 's more worrisome is the corrosive and contagious quality of the fear , not the flu . 
And frankly the economic impact of this outbreak has the potential to be even more painful and long-lasting for all of us . 
Yet the panicky atmosphere in Mexico City is palpably toxic . 
So I 'm heading out of town for a few days - before they really do shut down the metro .

2009-04-28,"The data just does not support the panic in the UK An electron micrograph of the A H1N1 swine influenza virus . 
Photograph : Centers for Disease Control\/Reuters The public panic about swine flu is completely out of proportion to the threat involved . 
People do n't seem to understand the concept of risk any more - either that or we have become so risk-averse as a society that we are not prepared to stomach even the slightest threat to our health . 
I am not belittling the plight of those who have the illness in Mexico and have seen relatives die . 
But we have to remember this is a very small number so far . 
The illness has spread to others in a less virulent form and there have been no deaths outside the country . 
There must be many more diseases in Mexico that claim more victims . 
For Brits to start talking about not traveling there or even suspending travel plans to the US is bonkers . 
The data shows that the risk of dying from swine flu is minuscule . 
Eight people are killed on the roads in the UK on average each day according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents , but that does n't stop people from driving or crossing the road . 
It is yet another sign of the lack of understanding of statistics in public life . 
I am always amazed at the outcry over rail or air safety when so few people die in accidents associated with either form of transport . 
And yet as a society we are prepared to tolerate thousands of road deaths without making any fuss at all and even resisting the lowering of the speed limit or the introduction of speed cameras which reduce that risk . 
OK , I know I am laying myself open to fomenting the spread of a pandemic . 
But we have to get these things in proportion . 
People need to weigh up the probabilities and make decisions for themselves . 
You are probably more likely to be hit by a UFO than to get swine flu .

The Express offers a double page spread on `` Pandemic Pandemonium '' . 
`` It destroyed the Roman Empire , wiped out most of the New World and killed millions in Europe . 
How disease - not just Mexico 's swine fever - has shaped the planet . '' 
It is littered with scaremongering including : `` Around a third of all humans could easily die off '' and `` The viruses killed the young and healthy '' and also runs a handy sidebar on `` why facemasks could be useless '' . 
The Telegraph reports , somewhat alarmingly , that online demand for Tamiflu is up 1000 % , with pharmacists warning that their stocks may not last . 
The Mail leads its story by saying that Britain can not hope to escape a `` global pandemic of swine flu '' , citing the UK 's chief medical officer saying cases here were inevitable .

'' 
Back to the real world , and an important point noted in a few of the papers today : all those who have shown symptoms of swine flu outside Mexico so far have recovered .

Why is swine flu causing death in Mexico but not elsewhere ? 
The Mexican paper La Jornada says the answer is simple : `` The inevitable contrast between the deaths in Mexico and the cases caused by the virus in the United States , which seem to be much more benign , has an equally inevitable explanation : poverty . '' 
My Spanish-speaking colleague , Robert White , says the paper castigates successive governments for pursuing neoliberal policies of `` trimming the state '' . 
La Jornada says this ensured that the long-awaited announcement of such a flu outbreak was always `` bound to be disastrous '' and fatal for many of those infected . 
At a press conference in Poland , Gordon Brown said he would be attending a meeting of the civil emergencies committee known as Cobra to discuss the swine flu crisis when he returned to London later this morning . 
Brown also said that one of the patients in a Scottish hospital with swine flu was expected to go home today .

On reports of new suspected cases in China , Hartl said : `` We have rumors all the time . 
It 's important that we hear rumors , they may turn out to be unfounded . '' 
As Hartl spoke , Reuters reported confirmed cases in New Zealand and Israel . 
`` We do n't understand why the disease has been more severe in Mexico , '' Hartl said . 
`` Mexico has large supplies of Tamiflu .

2009-04-28,"Finger pointing towards intensive farming is spreading like the H1N1 virus itself ; it 's time for an urgent inquiry to find out the facts The growing concern over the H1N1 swine flu virus a particularly alarming combination of swine , avian , and human viruses which has now reached the UK seems to have come almost out of nowhere . 
The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- is now calling the virus , which has infected an estimated 1,000 people and killed around 150 in Mexico , an `` international public health emergency '' that could reach global pandemic levels . 
But as Dr Michael Greger , director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture at the Humane Society of the United States , has pointed out , this is not the first time a triple hybrid human\/bird\/pig flu virus has been uncovered . 
The first was found in a North Carolina industrial pig farm in 1998 , and within a year it had spread across the United States . 
Dr Greger has highlighted how some experts blamed the emergence of the original 1998 virus on intensive farming practices in the US , where pigs and poultry are raised in extremely cramped conditions , in adjacent sheds and tended to by the same staff . 
North Carolina has the densest pig population in North America , with around twice as many swine mega-factories as any other state . 
In 1998 , North Carolina 's pig population had hit ten million , up from two million just six years before . 
Yet the number of hog farms was decreasing , with more and more animals being crammed into fewer and fewer farms . 
Since the primary route of swine flu transmission is thought to be the same as human flu , the increased potential for the spread of disease in such conditions is clear . 
More research is urgently needed to explore the potential link between industrialised animal farming , and the spread of disease . 
Some elements of the Mexican media are already pointing to the potential role of intensive pig farming in Mexico , which has grown substantially in recent years , with some giant operations raising tens of thousands of pigs at a time . 
Since news of the epidemic broke , reports in Mexico City daily La Jornada and Veracruz-based paper La Marcha have detailed how a number of community residents in the affected areas have expressed concerns over the operations of Smithfield Foods , the world 's largest pork packer and hog producer . 
According to these reports , in Veracruz where the outbreak originated , a Smithfield subsidiary called Granjas Carrol raises 950,000 hogs per year in intensive conditions . 
Smithfield has released a statement denying any link between the outbreak and Granjas Carrol 's operations in Mexico . 
It said the company routinely administers influenza virus vaccinations to its herds and conducts monthly tests for the presence of swine influenza . 
It said it had found no clinical signs or symptoms of swine influenza on its farms . 
This is not the first time intensive , industrialised agriculture has been accused of spreading disease . 
Recent avian flu outbreaks , for example , have shown the extent to which the export-oriented corporate model of poultry production may have spread strains such as H5N1 . 
In my report Avian flu : time to shut the intensive poultry flu factories ? 
of 2006 , I outlined how bird flu has been endemic in wild birds in much of the world without leaping the species barrier and causing people any harm . 
But in damp and cramped conditions , a series of mutations can occur resulting in a highly pathogenic form . 
Within crowded chicken factory farms , the mild virus can evolve rapidly towards more dangerous and highly transmissible forms , capable of jumping species and spreading back into wild birds , which are defenceless against the new strain . 
Experts are increasingly warning that the practices of intensive farming must be reviewed and regulated . 
While it will be difficult to reach any firm conclusions about this current outbreak of swine flu until more details emerge , it is crucial that the authorities undertake an urgent inquiry , in order to better understand the development and spread of animal-based epidemics which can be lethal to humans .

2009-04-28,"London mayor donates Tamiflu stockpile to UK amid swine flu warnings Boris Johnson confirms tried and tested plans in place to protect capital from virus Tuesday 28 April 2009 16.35 BST Tamiflu , which will be used if swine flu breaks out in Britain . 
Photograph : Sang Tan\/AP Boris Johnson , the mayor of London , said today that `` tried and tested plans '' were in place to combat the threat of any outbreak of the swine flu virus as he offered to donate the Greater London Authority 's stockpile of Tamiflu to ensure the UK is fully prepared . 
Swine flu , an apparently new strain of the H1N1 virus , has been confirmed in seven countries , and suspected outbreaks are being investigated in other places , including Ireland , Germany , Italy , Sweden and Denmark , amid warnings from the World Health Organisation that the disease can no longer be contained . 
Johnson 's office is in talks with central government about handing over 100,000 tablets of the anti-viral drug Tamiflu the GLA 's entire stock to the relevant authorities . 
The mayor is `` seeking assurances '' that London 's needs are fully considered in any contingency plans for the capital , according to a statement issued by his office . 
Johnson said : `` I 'm pleased to share these significant supplies of anti-virals with the agencies in the lead in protecting the UK and its capital . 
Thankfully , so far the virus has not been reported in London , but I 'd like to reassure everyone that tried and tested plans are in place to combat any threat , swiftly and comprehensively . '' 
The Tamiflu drugs were purchased by Johnson 's predecessor , Ken Livingstone , at a cost of # 1m as a precaution to help keep London 's public services running . 
Gordon Brown , who later today will join a meeting of the government 's Cobra emergency committee chaired by the health secretary , Alan Johnson , called for concerted global action to combat the virus .

2009-04-28,"Tue Apr 28 , 2009 9:03 pm BST -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Weather experts are studying swine flu to see if climate could influence its spread and severity . 
Determining the impact of cold , heat , dryness and humidity on the H1N1 strain -- which has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and had milder effects elsewhere -- could illuminate the countries and regions most vulnerable to infection . 
Climate information may also provide clues into whether the virus is likely to return year after year on a seasonal basis . 
Following are details about seasonality of regular flu , and the weather and other factors affecting its patterns , according to data from the World Health Organization , World Meteorological Organization , and leading scientists : Flu incidence peaks in the winter season in temperate parts of the world , generally described as areas outside the tropics . 
Cold and dry conditions help the virus survive outside the body , meaning that droplet particles take longer to evaporate and remain airborne for more extended periods in winter . 
Influenza outbreaks do occur in the tropics , though less frequently than in areas with less heat and humidity , and without the seasonality seen in areas with wintry weather . 
Poor laboratory and health data , especially from Africa and Latin America , have made it difficult for international experts to track viral transmission in tropical regions . 
School cycles have also been shown to affect the seasonality of flu . 
Winter school breaks tend to reduce flu transmission to children by as much as 25 percent , mainly because they provide fewer opportunities for the virus to spread among large groups . 
The precise strain of virus circulating , which can change from flu season to flu season , can also affect how virulent it is and how many people may fall ill in a given outbreak . 
The levels of immunity in the population , vaccination programs , hygiene practices and other practices also play a role .

2009-04-28,"WASHINGTON | Tue Apr 28 , 2009 8:37 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Former Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius was sworn in as U.S. health secretary on Tuesday in an Oval Office ceremony attended by President Barack Obama just hours after the Senate confirmed her nomination . 
`` We wanted to swear her in right away because we 've got a significant public health challenge that requires her immediate attention , and that is the H1N1 flu outbreak , '' Obama told reporters . 
`` I 'm thrilled that we have Secretary Sebelius taking the reins . 
She 's going to be immediately briefed on the issues that we 're working on right now , '' he said after the ceremony , which was conducted by the executive clerk of the White House with the president holding the Bible on which she took the oath . 
After the swearing-in , Sebelius immediately went into a briefing on the flu situation with Obama 's Homeland Security adviser John Brennan , White House spokesman Reid Cherlin said . 
The Senate confirmed Sebelius as health secretary in a 65-31 vote earlier in the day , filling a crucial spot in Obama 's cabinet amid growing fears of a possible swine flu pandemic . 
The Senate brushed back Republican opposition to her nomination because of her support for abortion rights . 
Sebelius was tapped by Obama to lead his push to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system . 
But she takes office as U.S. health officials rush to prepare for a possible widespread outbreak of a new strain of flu that has killed scores of people in Mexico and sickened at least 64 in the United States . 
The confirmation of Sebelius allows Obama to fill the last open seat in his cabinet . 
Democrats said the swine flu outbreak made it all the more important to end the delay in filling that pivotal position . 
`` It is essential for the health of the nation , that president Obama has in place and the nation has in place , a strong secretary of health and human services to make sure that our federal efforts on this potential pandemic are ably coordinated , '' said Democratic Senator Mark Warner . 
The Sebelius nomination had been delayed by Republicans opposed to her support for abortion rights and a failure to initially report the full extent of her campaign contributions from a doctor who performs abortions . 
Sebelius , a former insurance commissioner , will lead Obama 's push to enact by the end of this year an overhaul of the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare industry , one of the main political goals of his administration .

2009-04-28,"LONDON | Tue Apr 28 , 2009 9:03 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Testing whether a person has swine flu is not easy and it can take days to confirm that suspected cases are actually caused by the virus , a health expert said on Tuesday . 
The World Health Organization has confirmed 79 cases of a virus it said has spread from Mexico -- where it has killed up to 149 people -- into the United States , Canada , New Zealand and Europe , raising fears of a pandemic . 
But officials suspect more than 1,600 people may have the infection -- a disparity explained in part because there is no quick test , said Andrew Easton , a virologist at the University of Warwick in Britain . 
`` Many countries now will have several labs to carry this out , '' he told Reuters in a telephone interview . 
`` You ca n't do this in the field . '' 
WHO officials only report cases that have been confirmed by their own staffers , in their own labs , at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and a few other places . 
Mexico , for instance , ships samples to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta or Winnipeg in Canada for testing . 
While testing for seasonal flu is relatively simple , doing the same for H1N1 is far more complicated and none of the three techniques are widely available . 
One way to confirm swine flu is with a test that involves growing a virus culture in a lab and then sequencing its genetic material . 
Testing increases of antibodies and a technique called real-time PCR are the other approaches . 
The PCR technique -- which researcher Easton called the most efficient -- uses a device to amplify copies of genes so researchers can easily compare a sample taken from a sick person to the genetic material of the potentially pandemic infection . 
`` You start with a small number of copies of the virus genes and the technique multiplies them up in a test tube to give them many hundreds of thousands of copies of the virus genes which are easy to measure , '' Easton said . 
The first step for doctors and health officials is often collecting a sample at a local clinic or hospital and then sending it on to a more well-equipped lab for analysis . 
This can produce some of the biggest delays . 
Next researchers must purify the sample to get rid of natural compounds that may interfere with a reading -- something that also takes time , Easton said . 
`` Once you know the genetic makeup of the virus , the machine can tell whether the -LRB- genetic -RRB- sequence is that of the suspected infection , '' Easton said . 
`` If everything was optimized and there were plenty of people around to handle the result you could easily get a result that day . '' 
The PCR device itself can within a few hours compare the genetic makeup of the sample with that of a pandemic virus , Easton said . 
But a challenge for researchers is designing a test that health officials can conduct in the field , he added . 
`` It is technology that is stopping us from doing that at the moment , '' Easton said .

2009-04-28,"WASHINGTON | Tue Apr 28 , 2009 6:32 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - What 's in a name ? 
U.S. pork producers are finding that the name of the virus spreading from Mexico is having an impact on their business , prompting U.S. officials to argue for changing the name from swine flu . 
At a press briefing , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack took pains to repeatedly refer to the flu as the `` H1N1 virus . '' 
Israel has rejected the name swine flu , and opted to call it `` Mexico flu . '' 
Jewish dietary laws forbid eating pork . 
The Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health also objected to the name , saying the virus contains avian and human components and no pig so far has been found ill with the disease . 
And there is growing sentiment in the farm sector to call it the North American virus . 
For U.S. pork producers the swine flu name has hurt , forcing government officials into the position of stressing that American pork is safe to eat and that other countries should not ban imports . 
Pork , soybean and corn prices have fallen in the last two days , `` and if this continues , obviously you have significant potential , which is why it 's important to get this right , '' Vilsack said . 
`` This is not a food-borne illness , virus . 
It is not correct to refer to it as swine flu because really that 's not what this is about , '' he said .

A technician was transporting the container on Monday night to the Swiss national flu center in Geneva , where scientists are developing a flu test for humans , police said . 
One woman was hurt when the box exploded in reaction to the dry ice used to keep the samples cold . 
After consulting virus specialists , the police decided to stop the St. Gallen to Geneva train before it entered the station in Lausanne . 
The virus specialists confirmed that the samples being transported posed no risks to humans , police said .

2009-04-28,"LONDON | Tue Apr 28 , 2009 6:58 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Manufacturers have taken the first preparatory steps in developing a vaccine against a new strain of flu that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and threatens to become a pandemic . 
But the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said it would only call for large-scale production of such a pandemic vaccine if it strongly believed the world was on the edge of an unstoppable global outbreak of flu . 
Switzerland 's Novartis AG said on Tuesday it had received the genetic code of the new virus strain , enabling it to start work on evaluating production , and it hoped to receive the actual virus in its laboratories `` in the near future . '' 
Still , it is likely to take between five and six months before a vaccine is commercially available , according to the The delay is not for want of trying . 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already taken a sample of the H1N1 virus causing the disease , produced a vaccine virus strain and is growing it up , marking the first stage of the production process . 
These samples , which can then be distributed to companies , must be grown in specially produced chicken eggs in a cumbersome system that experts agree is outdated . 
New and more efficient technologies based on cell cultures are , however , still a few years away . 
While the race is on to prepare a pandemic vaccine , health authorities and companies still have to make the tricky decision of when , or indeed whether , to switch capacity from producing seasonal vaccines to making the new shot . 
`` If you go to pandemic flu production , people wo n't get normal flu shots -- it is a huge consideration , '' said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl . 
At least 20 companies , in addition to Novartis , make flu vaccines , including Sanofi-Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline , Baxter International , Australia 's CSL and nasal spray maker MedImmune , now part of AstraZeneca . 
They are currently geared to producing season flu shots , which vaccine specialists say will not stop the new form of swine flu spreading around the world , although people who have been immunized may end up with milder symptoms . 
So-called swine flu is a variant of the H1N1 form of the human influenza virus , but tests show the H1N1 component of the current seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against the new strain . 
A big challenge facing manufacturers will be making sufficient quantities of vaccine from a limited supply of active ingredient , or antigen . 
One option to extend supply is to use an additive , known as an adjuvant , to increase the body 's immune response and reduce the amount of antigen needed in each shot . 
Several companies are working on this approach . 
Glaxo , in particular , said it believed its novel adjuvant technology could make a significant contribution to antigen sparing . 
The British company previously developed a vaccine against the H5N1 strain of bird flu -- originally thought to pose the biggest pandemic threat -- using a special adjuvant that allowed an extremely low dose of active ingredient to be used . 
Credit Suisse analysts said companies with the know-how to make pandemic flu vaccines stood to benefit from additional sales , adding there could also be an increase in seasonal flu vaccine demand as disease awareness increases .

2009-04-28,"MEXICO CITY | Tue Apr 28 , 2009 12:49 am BST MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A new virus has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and the World Health Organisation moved closer on Monday to declaring it the first flu pandemic in 40 years as more people were infected in the United States and Europe . 
The WHO raised its pandemic alert level for the swine flu virus to phase 4 , indicating a significantly increased risk of a pandemic , a global outbreak of a serious disease . 
The last such outbreak , a `` Hong Kong '' flu pandemic in 1968 , killed about 1 million people . 
Although the new flu strain has so far killed people only in Mexico , there were more than 40 confirmed cases in the United States , including 20 at a New York City school where eight cases were already identified . 
In Mexico City , fearful Christians paraded a centuries-old statue of Jesus , believed to protect against disease , through the streets for the first time in more than a century .

Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said the outbreak was now suspected of having killed 149 people and warned the number of cases would keep rising . 
Thirty-three million Mexican schoolchildren will be off school until the middle of next week as authorities seek to contain the outbreak . 
Schools in the sprawling capital had already been closed but the government ordered classes canceled across the country until May 6 . 
Most of the those who died were between 20 and 50 years of age , an ominous sign because a hallmark of past pandemics has been the high rate of fatalities among healthy young adults . 
Worldwide , seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year but the new strain worries experts because it spreads rapidly between humans and there is no vaccine for it . 
Oil prices fell more than 2 percent to close to $ 50 a barrel as investors feared a new blow to an already fragile global economy if trade flows are curbed and manufacturing is hit .

2009-04-29,"EDGAR HERNANDEZ - FIRST CONFIRMED CASE Edgar Hernandez says he now feels a lot better Five-year-old Edgar Hernandez started feeling unwell in late March , suffering fever , headache and a very sore throat . 
Edgar was not alone . 
Several hundred people in his home village of La Gloria , near Perote in the Mexican state of Veracruz had also been sick with a respiratory disease , some falling ill back in December . 
At the time , doctors told Edgar 's mother , Maria del Carmen Hernandez , that it was just a regular cold . 
ABC News ' Jeffrey Kofman speaks to Edgar Hernandez But after her son got worse , she decided to take him to hospital where he was treated with antibiotics . 
Luckily Edgar recovered , although he has told many of the reporters who have descended on his family 's home that he felt very bad at the time . 
What makes Edgar the focus of such attention is that swabs taken from his throat and sent to a Canadian laboratory for analysis tested positive for a new strain of the H1N1 virus , known as swine flu . 
The Mexican government believes he is the first person to have been infected by the swine flu virus . 
Officials say samples from other people who were sick in La Gloria show they had a common flu virus . 
What remains a mystery is how Edgar contracted it , and how the virus has been spread . 
Local people have blamed the outbreak of sickness on nearby pig farms . 
However , a spokesman for the farms said there had been no sign of symptoms of swine flu either in its herds or among its employees . 
Edgar has never left the area , the Associated Press reports , and his family neither own nor work with pigs . 
However , local officials say many people from Perote live and work in Mexico City and there was a lot of travel between the area and the capital over Easter . 
ADELA GUTIERREZ - FIRST CONFIRMED FATALITY Adela Maria Gutierrez , a 39-year-old mother of three , fell ill in early April in the southern state of Oaxaca , which borders Veracruz . 
She went to the Aurelio Valdivieso Hospital in Oaxaca , the state capital , on 8 April but died five days later . 
Doctors initially thought her death was due to pneumonia complicated by diabetes and her death only provoked further concern when other patients began to show signs of severe respiratory infection several days later . 
Ms Gutierrez 's samples were also sent to Canada for testing , and she , like Edgar , was found to have tested positive for a new strain of virus . 
Ms Gutierrez worked as a door-to-door census-taker for the tax authorities and could therefore have had contact with large numbers of people . 
Local health officials have , however , denied reports that Ms Gutierrez had infected 20 people as well as members of her family . 
Oaxaca is one of Mexico 's poorest states but its beaches , jungles and historic buildings attract many tourists .

2009-04-29,"Mexico to re-test swine flu cases The widow of swine flu victim Gerardo Leyva first heard of the cause of his death when an Associated Press reporter contacted her , the news agency says Stricter swine flu tests have cut the number of confirmed deaths in Mexico , where the virus was first reported , from 20 to seven , authorities say . 
But officials warned the number of deaths likely to have been caused by swine flu has risen to 159 with more than 1,300 patients under observation . 
The number of cases globally is rising though no-one outside Mexico has died . 
Germany has become the latest country to confirm cases of the H1N1 virus , reporting three sufferers . 
Countries with suspected cases : Brazil , Guatemala , Peru , Australia , and South Korea , and seven EU states All three recently returned from Mexico , officials said . 
Spain and the UK earlier confirmed two cases each and six other EU states have been monitoring patients suspected of having the virus . 
At 64 , the US has the greatest number of confirmed cases outside Mexico . 
The state of California has declared a state of emergency and President Barack Obama is asking Congress for an additional $ 1.5 bn dollars to bolster the US response . 
A US federal health official , Dr Richard Besser of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said on Tuesday : `` As we continue to investigate cases here , I expect that we will see deaths in this country . '' 
Canada , New Zealand and Israel have also detected the virus , and other states with suspected cases include Australia , South Korea and Peru . 
In Mexico , there is some confusion over exactly how many people died from H1N1 , the BBC 's Stephen Gibbs reports . 
From Matthew Price in Oaxaca , Mexico The first fatal case of the virus is believed to have been contracted here in Oaxaca . 
It is a tourist center and the obvious concern is that when the visitors leave , they may take the virus with them . 
At the local cemetery , a group of gravediggers pointed me towards a freshly dug plot . 
The flowers on top had wilted under the sun but still had some color . 
Here was the grave of the first confirmed victim of the virus , Adela Gutierrez , 39 . 
One of the gravediggers , Sergio Castro Lopez , told me people here are worried . 
They are waiting for the authorities to tell them what they should do . 
I tried at the local hospital to get more information but the ministry of health has ordered its staff across the country to remain silent . 
This is largely because the government is now subjecting the samples it has from deceased patients to a more laborious verification process . 
Meanwhile , the search for the source of the outbreak continues , with the focus on the vicinity of a pig farm in the eastern part of the country . 
The Mexican government is urging against jumping to conclusions and is suggesting the possibility remains that the virus originated outside the country , our correspondent adds . 
The capital , Mexico City , has banned restaurants and cafes from serving all food except takeaways to try to prevent the spread of the virus . 
Schools across the country have closed , public gatherings are restricted and archaeological sites have been placed off-limits .

SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection Earlier , it confirmed that the flu was being transmitted between humans and called on countries to check their contingency plans for a possible pandemic . 
But the WHO also urged caution , saying measures like travel bans were unlikely to prove effective . 
Spain is one of the countries outside the Americas most vulnerable to the virus because of the sheer volume of its air passenger traffic with Mexico . 
It has two confirmed cases of swine flu and a further 32 people are undergoing tests . 
The government says the situation is `` under control '' , that no lives are at risk and that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission within Spain . 
There is great fear among the medical community ... One of my colleagues that was exposed chose to stay in a hotel rather than run the risk of infecting her daughters Dr Guadalupe , BBC News website reader in Mexico Instead , it says all those under observation fell ill after visiting Mexico . 
All incoming passengers from that country and the US are being asked to fill in forms with medical information and contact details and airlines have been ordered to carry surgical masks .

2009-04-29,"How flu strains adapt to be able to infect a new species is still a mystery The flu virus is a survivor . 
It must continually evolve in order to evade its biggest threat - the immune system . 
Mammals , including humans , make antibodies , which recognize and target the virus . 
`` So it has to keep mutating to escape being destroyed , '' explains David Morens from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
Despite these tactics , most of the strains that make people ill during the so-called `` flu season '' are sufficiently similar to infections most of us have been exposed to before . 
Our immune systems recognize common parts that these new strains share with their ancestors , and can launch an effective defense . 
Every so often , however , a different strain emerges and infects people - one that contains new genes from an animal virus . 
Its novelty is its most effective weapon against our immune defences . 
And if it is infectious enough to find its way easily into a new host - perhaps via an innocent sneeze - it can spread rapidly and cause a global epidemic - or pandemic . 
`` These events seem to be cyclical - they 've occurred about every 20-40 years , '' says Mark Honigsbaum a researcher at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London . 
`` And all of these pandemics have been associated with just a few strains , '' he says . 
Viral strains take their name from the various different types of two important proteins on their surface . 
Their initials are H for haemaglutanin , and N for neuraminidase . 
History teaches us that these pandemics ... are predictably unpredictable The haemaglutanin molecule protrudes from the surface of the virus as spikes , and enables it to lock on to receptors on the surface of cells . 
Neuraminidase allows the virus to be released from infected cells and infect new ones . 
`` There are 16 Hs and 9 Ns , but as far as we know , only H1 ,2,3 and only N1 and N2 have ever made it into a human virus , '' says Dr Morens . 
But beyond what is currently speculation that only a few strains may be transmissible among humans , the structure of flu gives us almost no clues about how it might behave and change . 
`` History teaches us to take these pandemics very seriously , '' says Howard Markel , director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan . 
`` But it also teaches us that they are predictably unpredictable . '' 
The first of the four pandemics was Russian flu - each takes its name from the country where the first case was reported - which emerged in 1889 . 
This was well before the science of virology had even been conceived . 
It rapidly spread through Europe , and reached North America and Latin America , lasting until 1892 and eventually killing an estimated one million people . 
Medical facilities were overwhelmed by the 1918 flu pandemic `` We have very little information about this strain , '' says Dr Morens . 
`` But in the mid 1900s , scientists started collecting , and more importantly preserving , serum samples from people who had been alive during the flu pandemic . 
So there is now some evidence that it could have been an H3 virus . 
`` If it turned out to be true that only limited types of influenza genes have the ability to work in a human virus , that would be important , because you could vaccinate the world 's population against the known possibilities of a pandemic virus , '' he says . 
Although at its early stages , work is already progressing on a universal vaccine - one that would stimulate human immune systems to recognize , and raise antibodies against parts of the influenza virus shared by all strains . 
But , during the last century , the virus has shown a deadly ability to change beyond recognition . 
In 1918 , an influenza pandemic started that became a global disaster - eventually killing more people than the Great War . 
Estimates of the death toll from the 1918 outbreak of Spanish flu range from 20 million to 40 million . 
Some historians argue it could have been as high as 100 million . 
`` There was a mild wave in the spring , but the very serious , lethal wave was in the autumn to the winter , '' says Professor Markel . 
`` Then a third wave in January to April 1919 , and a fourth wave in the winter of 1920 . '' 
This tendency for `` waves '' of infection and re-infection makes the virus yet more unpredictable . 
New vaccines for circulating strains are now designed every year At the time the medical consensus was that the disease was caused not by a virus , but by a bacterium called Haemophilus influenzae . 
So some countries , including the US and UK , distributed vaccinations against the wrong disease-causing agent . 
`` Another problem was that the authorities stuck their heads in the sand , '' says Mr Honigsbaum . 
`` Their priority was the war and they did n't have the resources to deal with the health crisis . 
`` There 's an argument that if they 'd been more proactive , and diverted doctors and nurses from the front to civilian needs , they could have saved more lives . '' 
Dr Morens refers to the 1918 H1N1 strain as `` the mother of all pandemics '' . 
`` In the category of Influenza A , which is the category of virus that has caused all human epidemics and pandemics , every virus circulated since 1918 has been a descendent of this virus in one way or another , '' he says . 
`` Descendants of the 1918 pandemic are still infecting human beings , but they have mutated again and again and again to be able to survive . '' 
The 1918 influenza pandemic gripped a vulnerable , unprepared human population , but its ability to `` reassort '' - or exchange its genes with other viruses - was what made it `` dangerously novel '' . 
We had two lineages of the disease , both of which have persisted National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases `` Every species has its own flu - when those species live together , and they can transmit their flu to different species , the virus itself changes its structure , '' says Professor Markel . 
Since our immune systems recognize and respond mainly to the H and N part of the molecule , scientists suspect that pandemics arise when a strain emerges with a big change in the structure of one of these proteins . 
But how exactly the virus adapts to enable it to attach to receptors on the cells of a different species , is an `` unanswerable '' question , says Dr Morens . 
`` With only four pandemics in over 100 years , our sample size is too small to say , but it seems that a new H -LRB- on the surface of the virus -RRB- has been the major factor , '' says Dr Morens . 
`` We do n't know where the 1918 virus came from , but the evidence is that it was a new virus . 
`` At the same time that it infected humans , it also infected pigs . 
And at that point , we began to have two lineages of that disease - the human virus , and the pig virus , which persisted too , '' he adds . 
The progeny of the 1918 influenza strain evolved and mutated as they were transmitted from one host to another . 
And on two further occasions , these strains incorporated completely new genes and spread globally once again . 
`` That 's what happened in 1957 and 1968 - a hybrid formed of the 1918 virus with genes that were never part of it before , '' says Dr Morens . 
In the case of the 1957 Asian flu outbreak , a human H2N2 virus combined with the genes of a strain found in wild ducks . 
The pandemic killed an estimated one million people worldwide . 
An outbreak of H3N2 Hong Kong flu in 1968 , when avian and human virus genes combined once again , claimed another million lives . 
In both cases , the impact was minimized by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccines available . 
`` Now , every year , around summer time , a group of flu experts get together and see what strains are circulating so they can design an appropriate vaccine , '' says Dr Markel . 
And in the last few years , principally because of the global concern about avian flu , anti-viral drugs that target influenza , such as Tamiflu , have been introduced . 
The emergence of a virus that crosses a species barrier is extremely rare But Professor Markel points out that , despite having reached new levels of medical preparation , `` we live in a world of emerging infectious diseases '' . 
`` We have learned to take avian flu very seriously , and we have learned to take the animal kingdom very seriously , '' he says . 
But in the rare event that a virus does develop that is able to cross the species barrier , he points out that the close proximity of domestic farm animals to humans provides an opportunity for human infection . 
`` Human beings travel farther and faster than ever before . 
All of this means that we are set up for a potential epidemic or pandemic , '' concludes Professor Markel . 
`` We learn more every time , but the story of flu pandemics is still very much a story in progress . ''

2009-04-29,"Matthew Price reports from Mexico A 23-month-old Mexican child has died of swine flu in Texas - the first death from the virus outside Mexico , where it may have killed as many as 159 people . 
The child - one of 91 cases of swine flu in the US - had been visiting relatives in Texas when he fell ill . 
The World Health Organization said the virus was still spreading , even though it was now from person to person . 
And Spain says it has confirmed the first case of swine flu in a person who has not traveled to Mexico . 
US : one death , at least 91 confirmed cases The Mexican boy had arrived in the Texan border city of Brownsville on 4 April and developed flu symptoms four days later , the Texas Department of State Health Services said . 
He was later transferred to a hospital in Houston , where he died on Monday night . 
The cause of death was confirmed on Wednesday by Dr Richard Besser , acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
`` Unfortunately this morning I do have to confirm that we have the first death of a child from H1N1 flu virus , '' he told US TV channel CBS .

Texas Governor Rick Perry said closing the US border with Mexico was an option , but added that taking that step now would be `` a little premature '' . 
The assistant director general of the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , Keiji Fukuda , said that although the virus originated in pigs , it was now being transmitted from human to human . 
`` It is clear that the virus is spreading and we do n't see evidence of it slowing down , '' he told reporters from WHO headquarters in Geneva . 
He added that moving the pandemic alert to five - the second highest - from the current four would be a significant step , but was not necessary at the moment . 
He said the WHO would do so if infected people in at least two countries were spreading the disease to other people in a sustained way . 
The WHO has said measures like travel bans were unlikely to prove effective . 
France will ask the European Union on Thursday to suspend all flights going to Mexico because of the flu outbreak , Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said .

2009-04-29,"Vials containing samples of the swine flu virus are making their way from the US to a government laboratory north of London . 
The race for a vaccine is on . 
Manufacturers are currently working on the seasonal flu vaccine It is a global endeavor and will bring the public and the private together , but it could still take several months before a safe and effective jab is available . 
Yet amid all this activity , the answer could in fact be right under our noses . 
Tests are being carried out to establish whether the current seasonal flu vaccine could provide cross protection against what we are seeing at the moment , as there are similarities between the H1N1 human flu viruses and the new H1N1 swine flu . 
If that were the case - and it 's certainly not impossible - we would in the words of one virologist be `` home and dry '' . 
Even if this does not confer protection , the picture does not appear to be a bleak one . 
The spread of bird flu amongst humans several years ago sparked fears that a pandemic was imminent . 
Plans were developed , expertise harnessed and facilities built for mass production . 
If this had happened six years ago we would really be in a fix - we are in a better position than we have ever been in the history of this planet to combat this Barts and the London School of Medicine The vaccine industry has started to attract new investment and government subsidies after years of being a pharmaceutical backwater . 
`` It was a fantastic dry run , '' says Professor John Oxford of Barts and the London School of Medicine . 
`` If this had happened six years ago we would really be in a fix - we are in a better position than we have ever been in the history of this planet to combat this . '' 
The World Health Organisation says it is already in touch with vaccine manufacturers - although is not at this stage putting in orders - but initial work is already underway in national laboratories . 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which is looking at the molecular properties of the virus and why it appears to have been more virulent in Mexico is hoping to have produced a `` reference strain '' to send to vaccine manufacturers around the second week of May . 
The same process will take place in the UK , once the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- receives samples of the virus at its laboratories in Potters Bar . 
`` We will take this virus apart and reassemble it with two genes from the swine virus and the genetic information code for a laboratory virus called PR8 which grows very well in hens ' eggs and is safe for human infection , '' said Dr John Wood , from the HPA 's National Institute of Biological Standards and Control . 
`` When we have recreated this new hybrid virus this will be grown in cells and hens ' eggs ready to distribute to vaccine manufacturers . '' 
This , he said , should be done within three to four weeks . 
But it may be at least four to five months before a vaccine is ready . 
Clearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine Safety is - unsurprisingly - paramount , as vaccines can often be worse than the disease they are trying to combat . 
An outbreak of swine flu in 1976 infected 200 people in the US . 
Only one of them died , but a vaccine administered to 40m people killed 25 and led to 500 others developing Guillain-Barre syndrome , which can be fatal . 
For those countries now entering the summer months with the flu season behind them , a delay in vaccine is not a real cause for concern . 
But in the southern hemisphere where countries are entering their winter months the picture would be different if the outbreak were to worsen . 
One way of administering the vaccine could be by adding a swine flu component to the seasonal flu jab given out in the autumn . 
But while production facilities are much more extensive than they once were , it could still take several years to produce enough swine vaccine to match global demand if the virus continues to spread and becomes more virulent . 
And in the rush to combat swine flu - from which there have been fewer than 10 confirmed deaths - manufacturers still have to keep their eye on producing an effective vaccine for seasonal flu as they do every year . 
In the US alone there are an estimated 25-50 million cases reported each year . 
These result in 150,000 hospitalisations and 30,000 to 40,000 deaths . 
Worldwide there may be as many as half a million deaths each year . 
`` Clearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine , '' warned Chris Viehbacher , chief executive officer of Sanofi-Aventis . 
In any event , swine flu appears to be responding well to anti-viral treatments like Tamiflu and Relenza . 
These drugs do not attack the virus itself but an enzyme that allows it to spread within the body . 
Taken promptly , they can reduce the severity and length of the illness . 
But production of sufficient quantities - were they needed - could again be problematic , although pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Roche Holding AG have both said they are stepping up production .

The cull was going ahead despite there being no cases of swine flu in Egypt . 
However , neighbouring Israel has two confirmed cases in humans .

People are anxious about the cull , fearing it will destroy their livelihood and the government will not give compensation . 
`` We have been living here for years doing this . 
We will not surrender , '' one breeder said . 
They are threatening a strike . 
`` Let Cairo drown in garbage . '' 
The pigs in Egypt , a largely Muslim country , are raised by the Coptic Christian community . 
Estimates of the number of pigs range from 250,000 to 400,000 . 
Up to 169 people are believed to have died in the outbreak - all but one of them in Mexico . 
Confirmed cases of swine flu have been reported in numerous other countries , including New Zealand , Spain , Austria and Canada , but most have been mild cases . 
Many of those victims had been to Mexico , prompting airport screening for passengers displaying potential flu symptoms . 
Egyptian authorities increased numbers of medical staff at Cairo airport to check passengers arriving from Mexico and will monitor them during their stay . 
Egypt suffered during the outbreak of bird flu , between 2004 and 2008 , with 22 deaths reported . 
The latest swine flu is a variation of H1N1 , which causes seasonal outbreaks of flu in humans on a regular basis . 
However , this strain contains genetic material that is typically found in strains of the virus that affect humans , birds and swine .

Follow the latest updates and reactions to the spread of the virus Before we start on another day of swine flu blogging , a word or two on why we have been doing this . 
The Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins complained today of `` demented '' coverage of the swine flu outbreak and the need to put this in perspective . 
Many of those commenting on this blog yesterday felt that minute-by-minute treatment of the outbreak was an example of yet more media hysteria . 
We 've been trying to avoid panicky reporting - please keep letting us know when you think we are getting too excited . 
What we are trying to do here is stick to the important developments in what is a fast-moving story , and also report on how the outbreak is being covered and talked about . 
The head of the US Centres for Disease Control , Richard Besser , said the virus is almost certain to claim lives in America . 
`` I fully expect we will see deaths from this infection , '' he said . 
Germany 's national disease control center says it has confirmed three swine flu cases , making it the third country in Europe where the disease has surfaced . 
Several colleagues say they saw people wearing masks in London today . 
Twitter users have also spotted masks in the capital . 
`` First sighting of a commuter wearing a face mask on the Northern Line . 
Looks very out of place , '' tweets Gary Gale . 
It has n't been easy to find those who know people who have died from the new strain of flu or who have relatives suffering from them , which is n't helped by the fact the the Mexican authorities are refusing to publish a list of the dead . 
I did find people affected by the illness of course -LRB- hey - come on - I 'm a snoop -RRB- but , well , given that the swine flu has been labeled a pandemic , there 's no panic in the streets , no riots in the hospitals , and no over-supply of sufferers of their families to speak to . 
Another Mexico-based blogger , Burro Hall , has some wry words on the subject of panic . 
We heartily endorse panic - not because we think there 's more to fear than fear itself , but because panic , particularly on the part of the state 's public officials , tends to get results .

Richard Besser , acting director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention , has confirmed that 23-month-old child has died of swine flu in Texas . 
Gordon Brown has confirmed that the government has ordered several million facemasks for NHS staff . 
Speaking at prime minister 's questions , he added that Tamiflu would only be given out when symptoms are discovered . 
For more follow Andrew Sparrow 's live coverage of PMQs . 
`` Mexico City is a ghost town , it 's weird '' , Rory Carroll reports from the Mexican capital . 
Three more cases of swine flu have been confirmed in the UK , Gordon Brown said today , bringing the total number to five . 
The prime minister told the Commons that a 12-year-old girl from Torbay was among the victims , and her school , Paignton Community College , had been temporally closed and all other pupils offered anti-viral medicines . 
Brown said the other two new cases were adults , one from Birmingham and one from London . 
All three had recently traveled to Mexico and had shown mild symptoms and were responding well to treatment . 
Egypt is considering a cull of pigs as `` precautionary measure '' , according to Reuters . 
The agency suggests that the move is motivated more by desire to quell panic rather than a serious attempt to stop the spread of the disease - which is not spread by pigs . 
Ben Goldacre , GP and author of the Guardian 's Bad Science column , is looking for examples of swine flu scaremongering and misrepresentation -LRB- do n't all send him this blog -RRB- . 
Health secretary Alan Johnson said the infected pupil in Torbay has been in close contact with 50 fellow pupils . 
They and 150 others have been given antiviral drugs . 
Facemasks ca n't stop the disease spreading , Johnson said , but it can be a help for NHS staff he says . 
He also sets out steps that people can take to stop the spread of the disease . 
`` Catch it , bin it , kill it '' is the theme . 
There will also be TV and newspaper adverts , Johnson said at a Department of Health press conference . 
Chief medical officer Liam Donaldson pointed out that all those affected had traveled to Mexico . 
The 12-year-old girl in Torbay was on the same flight from Mexico as the newlywed couple from Scotland who have also tested positive for the virus , Johnson said . 
Antivirals can help prevent people catching the virus , Donaldson said . 
But he said it was not sensible to issue everyone with antivirals . 
Ed Balls , the children 's secretary , said that the school in Devon Paignton Community and Sports College , will be closed for seven days . 
Airlines will be asked to keep the records of passenger on flights from affected areas , Johnson said . 
Facemasks are of very little value and give a false sense of security , Donaldson said . 
Keeping you hands clean is more important , he said . 
We have 33 million dose of antiviral treatment , Johnson said . 
Front line NHS workers will get priority . 
The government aims to get 50 million doses , he said . 
Donaldson said that a vaccine will be developed when a `` proper profile '' of the virus has been established . 
We are now up to 25 suspected cases in the UK , Johnson said . 
But he added this is a `` fast-moving situation '' . 
An official then tells him that it is up to 78 cases now . 
The BBC is reporting that seven of the nine people who were in contact with Iain and Dawn Askham , the newly weds who were the first Britons known to contract the virus , have tested negative for swine flu . 
This report has not been confirmed . 
-LRB- This is Haroon Siddique , I have taken over from Matthew Weaver while he takes a break -RRB- . 
Donaldson just explained to Sky News why masks are not the answer : `` The pores in the masks let through viruses . 
Viruses go through because the viruses are so small ... they -LRB- the masks -RRB- give a false sense of security . '' 
Worcestershire primary care trust confirmed today that a woman from Redditch has contracted swine flu . 
The department from health confirmed to the Guardian that the man from Birmingham cited by Johnson and Brown is in fact a 41-year-old woman from Redditch . 
The other two cases are the 12-year-old girl from Devon and a 22-year-old man from south London . 
Wendy Orent , author of Plague : The Mysterious Past and Terrifying Future of the World 's Most Dangerous Disease , has written an article for the LA Times in which she says categorically we are not facing a pandemic : `` Only packed conditions allowing deathly sick hosts to pass disease repeatedly to the well can produce highly virulent strains of flu -- for animals or for people . 
The usual sort of human crowding will not do it . 
Even massive , densely populated Mexico City , with more than 20 million inhabitants , wo n't produce the kind of lethal strains that the Western Front did in World War I. People died in Mexico because they were close to the epicenter of the disease , to the probable emergence of lethal strains from crowded pig breeding . 
But natural selection 's corrective action is swift and predictable : The strains spreading across the world are milder . '' 
The child died on Monday night , according to AP . 
Mexico City 's mayor Marcelo Ebrard says the swine flu outbreak seems to be stabilising . 
He said there was one more death to report . 
Ebrard said if the death toll keeps tapering off , he says he will consider easing the restrictions on public gatherings in the city . 
Scottish health secretary Nicolas Sturgeon has given the Scottish parliament an update on the health of Iain and Dawn Askham . 
A second couple who became ill after returning from a Mexico honeymoon remained in quarantine in their home , according to PA. . 
Pete and Jenny Marshall said they had been told to stay in their house in Edinburgh , along with friend Gemma O'Brien , as they wait to find out if they have contracted the virus . 
The WHO is also holding a news conference on the outbreak . 
Sebelius said antivirals are effective against the virus . 
`` We expect to see more cases and unfortunately more deaths , '' she said . 
Richard Besser , the acting director of the US CDC , said the situation is uncertain and changing quickly . 
We know from seasonal flu that 36,000 people die each year from flu . 
He said there are now 91 confirmed cases of swine flu in 10 US states . 
Five of these cases have resulted in people going to hospital . 
But he warned that the information is probably already out of date because the situation is changing so fast . 
`` We call this a pre-pandemic situation , '' Besser said . 
`` Unfortunately we will see more deaths . '' 
The WHO said it is moving closer to increasing its pandemic alert level . 
An official from the US Food and Drug Administration -LRB- whose name I did n't catch on the teleconference -RRB- said vaccine trials could start within two months . 
He explained why the disease is a concern : `` We have not seen this virus before . 
There is no background immunity in the population and spreading from human to human . '' 
Spain has detected its first case of swine flu in a person who has not recently visited Mexico , health minister Trinidad Jimenez said , Reuters reports . 
The CDC has confirmed the locations of the 91 US cases . 
The sun never sets on the Guardian 's swine flu coverage . 
Daniel Nasaw here , from the Washington bureau . 
Thanks Matthew and Haroon . 
From Mexico , Tara Huntington Hyde wonders on Comment is free : As multiple sources and medical experts have pointed out in the media , common strains of flu are responsible for far more deaths each year . 
So why all the frenzy ? 
A spokeswoman for BA says : We 're keeping the situation under review . 
We revised our booking policy -LRB- allowing people to reroute or defer travel -RRB- when the FCO changed its advisory on Monday , and we would review our policy again following any EC directives . 
But people still want to fly to Mexico . 
There were several dozen people on our flight out there this morning . 
There are people who want to fly out to help their families in Mexico and people who want to come home from Mexico . 
And the WHO said that there was no point in stopping travel . 
Our staff are briefed to help people with their questions . 
We have n't had time to consider France 's request to suspend flights , but we are still operating 12 flights a week to Mexico City and people are still flying . 
A high school in San Jose , California , is closed today until May 6 after a student tested positive for swine flu . 
The Santa Clara County , California health department sent parents a note that opens : `` Dear Parents : On April 23 , 2009 your child may have been exposed to swine flu '' . 
The note says officials closed the school on the advice of the Centres for Disease Control . 
Dr Keiji Fukuda of the WHO just told reporters the swine flu virus is clearly spreading and that officials have seen no evidence its spread is slowing . 
Fukuda said the organization is moving closer to declaring phase 5 on its pandemic alert . 
He said there is clear evidence now of human-to-human transmission . 
We 're currently at phase 4 out of 6 , with 6 indicating a pandemic . 
Phase 5 is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region . 
While most countries will not be affected at this stage , the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization , communication , and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short . 
The Guardian 's Chris McGreal describes a father 's terrifying ordeal . 
A California man says his 16-year old son narrowly escaped death from the swine flu : I could n't even touch my son he was so hot . 
I could n't pick him up . 
His muscles were seizing up on him . 
He could n't move . 
He had a fever of 102 . 
He was throwing up , and diarrhoea . 
He screamed out when I touched him . 
My wife was freaking out . 
I thought I was going to lose my son . 
It 's the hardest thing in the world . 
The Guardian 's Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell reports some good news : 13 suspected cases there tested negative for swine flu . 
He writes that Scottish health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said tests on eight of the nine people who had been in contact with the first Britons to catch swine flu had shown they were not suffering from swine flu . 
Five others were also negative . 
Potential Swine Flu , huh ? 
Best stay at home , batten down the hatches and play some computer games ! 
What should we play first !? Resi Evil 5 !? Severin Carrell reports that the three British swine flu victims were all aboard a Thomson Airways First Choice flight from Canc n to Birmingham on April 21 . 
That was number TOM 578 . 
The airline said it would send a special flight for British holidaymakers who want to leave tomorrow morning , flying to Manchester and London Gatwick . 
The American Libertarian Party advises Obama to close the US border with Mexico , despite a WHO determination that the move would do little to stem the spread of the virus that has now spread to more than 30 countries . 
Communications director Donny Ferguson said in a statement : The proper response is simple . 
The government should use its rightful authority over the border to control entry into our country of foreign nationals who pose a threat to our health by spreading the virus into areas where it does not exist . 
America 's doctors , hospitals and health care professionals the best in the world should then take the lead on eradicating the virus where it already exists . 
Ferguson notes the only US death from swine flu was a Mexican toddler who traveled to Houston on holiday with his family . 
The Obama administration has ruled out the move . 
On Comment is free , Ben Goldacre defends the coverage : `` For so many people , their very first assumption on the story is that the media are lying '' . 
In La Glorida , Mexico , The Guardian 's Jo Tuckman writes about the search for swine flu ground zero . 
Meanwhile , in Paignton , Devon , The Guardian 's Steven Morris says parents at a school shuttered by authorities are concerned and angry after learning a 12-year old tested positive for swine flu . 
In Mexico City , The Guardian 's Latin America correspondent Rory Carroll writes that the city 's denizens are furious at an edict shutting its 30,000 restaurants . 
Not even after the 1985 earthquake was it like this , '' said Juan Perez , 44 , scrubbing the front of Julia 's , a shuttered taco joint on Avenida Cuauhtemoc . 
`` This is a disaster . '' 
On the other hand , he notes : Crime rates have fallen , air quality has greatly improved and birds are audible on what once were thronged thouroughfares . 
Reuters just reported that the WHO is likely to increase the flu alert phase to 5 because `` things are moving fast '' . 
The report quotes `` one well-informed source '' . 
The United States Marine Corps has confirmed a marine at a base in Twentynine Palms , California tested positive for swine flu . 
He and his roommate are being kept in isolation . 
The stricken marine showed up at an on-base medical clinic over the weekend complaining of flu-like symptoms , and has since largely recovered , the Marine Corps said . 
The Guardian 's Chris McGreal says South African health officials are investigating the first suspected cases of swine flu in Africa . 
South Africa 's National Institute for Communicable Diseases is testing a woman from the Western Cape who returned from Mexico on April 24 , and a woman from Gauteng who also recently returned from Mexico . 
Both are not seriously ill . 
The Southern hemisphere is just entering the annual flu season . 
US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano reiterates the Obama administration has no plans to close the border with Mexico . 
Also , she said border agents have stopped 49 people showing suspected signs of swine flu . 
All but eight were subsquently cleared , and those were still under observation , she said . 
WHO Director General Dr Margaret Chan just announced the organization is raising its flu pandemic alert level to phase 5 out of 6 . 
`` All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans , '' she said . 
Phase 5 indicates `` pandemic is imminent '' , according to the WHO . 
WHO 's Chan was asked about countries ' freedom to break Roche 's patent on Tamiflu , an antiviral drug that has proven effective in treating the H1N1 swine flu , in order to manufacture it locally and , presumably , more cheaply . 
Chan left the door open : `` When and what the country is going to decide , it is their decision . ''

2009-04-29,"A panic stoked in order to posture and spend Despite the hysteria , the risk to Britons ' health is tiny - but that news wo n't sell papers or drugs , or justify the WHO 's budget We have gone demented . 
Two Britons are or were -LRB- not very -RRB- ill from flu . 
`` This could really explode , '' intones a reporter for BBC News . 
`` London warned : it 's here , '' cries the Evening Standard . 
Fear is said to be spreading `` like a Mexican wave '' . 
It `` could affect '' three-quarters of a million Britons . 
It `` could cost '' three trillion dollars . 
The `` danger '' , according to the radio , is that workers who are not ill will be `` worried '' -LRB- perhaps by the reporter -RRB- and fail to turn up at power stations and hospitals . 
Appropriately panicked , on Monday ministers plunged into their Cobra bunker beneath Whitehall to prepare for the worst . 
Had Tony Blair been about they would have worn germ warfare suits . 
British government is barking mad . 
What is swine flu ? 
It is flu , a mutation of the H1N1 virus of the sort that often occurs . 
It is not a pandemic , despite the media prefix , not yet . 
The BBC calls it a `` potentially terrible virus '' , but any viral infection is potentially terrible . 
Flu makes you feel ill . 
You should take medicine and rest . 
You will then get well again , unless you are very unlucky or have some complicating condition . 
It is best to avoid close contact with other people , as applies to a common cold . 
In Mexico , 2,000 people have been diagnosed as suffering swine flu . 
Some 150 of them have died , though there is said to be no pathological indication of all these deaths being linked to the new flu strain . 
People die all the time after catching flu , especially if not medicated . 
Nobody anywhere else in the world has died from this infection and only a handful have the new strain confirmed , most in America and almost all after returning from Mexico . 
A couple from Airdrie who caught the flu on holiday in Cancun are getting better . 
That tends to happen to people who get flu , however much it may disappoint editors . 
We appear to have lost all ability to judge risk . 
The cause may lie in the national curriculum , the decline of `` news '' or the rise of blogs and concomitant , unmediated hysteria , but people seem helpless in navigating the gulf that separates public information from their daily round . 
They can not set a statistic in context . 
They can not relate bad news from Mexico to the risk that inevitably surrounds their lives . 
The risk of catching swine flu must be millions to one . 
Health scares are like terrorist ones . 
Someone somewhere has an interest in it . 
We depend on others with specialist knowledge to advise and warn us and assume they offer advice on a dispassionate basis , using their expertise to assess danger and communicating it in measured English . 
Words such as possibly , potentially , could or might should be avoided . 
They are unspecific qualifiers and open to exaggeration . 
The World Health Organisation , always eager to push itself into the spotlight , loves to talk of the world being `` ready '' for a flu pandemic , apparently on the grounds that none has occurred for some time . 
There is no obvious justification for this scaremongering . 
I suppose the world is `` ready '' for another atomic explosion or another 9\/11 . 
Professional expertise is now overwhelmed by professional log-rolling . 
Risk aversion has trounced risk judgment . 
An obligation on public officials not to scare people or lead them to needless expense is overridden by the yearning for a higher budget or more profit . 
Health scares enable media-hungry doctors , public health officials and drugs companies to benefit by manipulating fright . 
On Monday the EU health commissioner , Androulla Vassiliou , advised travellers not to go to north or central America `` unless it 's very urgent '' . 
The British Foreign Office warned against `` all but essential '' travel to Mexico because of the danger of catching flu . 
It would make more sense to proffer such a warning against the American crime rate . 
Yet such health-and-safety hysteria wiped millions from travel company shares . 
During the BSE scare of 1995-7 , grown men with medical degrees predicted doom , terrifying ministers into mad politician disease . 
The scientists ' hysteria , that BSE `` has the potential to infect up to 10 million Britons '' , led to tens of thousands of cattle being fed into power stations and # 5bn spent on farmers ' compensation . 
A year later , the scientists tried to maintain that BSE `` might '' spread to sheep because , according to one government scientist , `` the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence '' . 
The meat industry was wrecked and an absurd ongoing cost was imposed on stock farmers with the closure and concentration of abattoirs . 
This science-based insanity was repeated during the Sars outbreak of 2003 , asserted by Dr Patrick Dixon , formerly of the London Business School , to have `` a 25 % chance of killing tens of millions '' . 
The press duly headlined a plague `` worse than Aids '' . 
Not one Briton died . 
The same lunacy occurred in 2006 with avian flu , erupting after a scientist named John Oxford declared that `` it will be the first pandemic of the 21st century '' . 
The WHO issued a statement that `` one in four Britons could die '' . 
Epidemiologists love the word `` could '' because it can always assure them of a headline . 
During the avian flu mania , Canada geese were treated like Goering 's bombers . 
RSPB workers were issued with protective headgear . 
The media went berserk , with interviewers asking why the government did not close all schools `` to prevent up to 50,000 deaths '' . 
The Today program 's John Humphrys became frantic when a dead goose flopped down on an isolated Scottish beach and a hapless local official refused to confirm the BBC 's hysteria . 
The bird might pose no threat to Scotland , but how dare he deny London journalists a good panic ? 
Meanwhile a real pestilence , MRSA and C difficile , was taking hold in hospitals . 
It was suppressed by the medical profession because it appeared that they themselves might be to blame . 
These diseases have played a role in thousands of deaths in British hospitals - the former a reported 1,652 and the latter 8,324 in 2007 alone . 
Like deaths from alcoholism , we have come to regard hospital-induced infection as an accident of life , a hazard to which we have subconsciously adjusted . 
MRSA and C difficile are not like swine flu , an opportunity for public figures to scare and posture and spend money . 
They are diseases for which the government is to blame . 
They claim no headlines and no Cobra priority . 
Their sufferers must crawl away and die in silence . 
A panic stoked in order to posture and spend This article appeared on p29 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 00.01 BST on Wednesday 29 April 2009 . 
Time for a ban .

2009-04-29,"LONDON | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 11:17 am BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Leaflets giving advice about the new H1N1 swine flu virus are to be sent to every home in the country , the Department of Health said on Wednesday . 
The leaflets will contain information about the flu outbreak and advice on preventing its spread . 
In Scotland , medical officials are waiting for the results of flu tests on 23 people . 
The health department said it was `` urgently '' investigating how to increase its stockpile of face masks for healthcare workers who would come into contact with infected patients if the outbreak became widespread . 
But it said it was not advising the general public to wear masks . 
`` Although we are aware that face masks are being given out to the public in Mexico , the available scientific evidence does not support the general wearing of face masks by those who are not ill whilst going about their normal activities , '' a health department spokesman said . 
Two people in Britain have tested positive for the infection , a honeymooning Scottish couple who recently returned from Mexico , the epicentre of what has become a global flu alert . 
Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that nine of the 23 people awaiting the results of tests had been in contact with the couple , who are said to be recovering well . 
The remaining 14 people waiting for results have travel links to Mexico and the United States . 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said Britain is among the best prepared countries in the world to deal with the outbreak . 
In Mexico , the only country to have suffered swine flu deaths , the government puts the toll at more than 150 and says 1,300 people are in hospital , some of them seriously ill . 
The World Health Organisation says 26 cases of swine flu had been confirmed in Mexico and that seven of those had died . 
The WHO said the current outbreak could lead to only a mild pandemic but warned that the 1918 flu pandemic , which killed tens of millions , started that way .

2009-04-29,"Credit : Reuters\/Cynthia Goldsmith\/Centers for Disease Control\/Handout LOS ANGELES | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 9:12 pm EDT LOS ANGELES -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - About 30 Marines on a Southern California military base , the nation 's largest , have been quarantined after one became the first U.S. serviceman known to have contracted the swine flu virus , the Marine Corps said on Wednesday . 
The case at the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center , the principal U.S. training facility for Marines and sailors deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq , was confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the base said in a statement . 
Occupying about 935 square miles -LRB- 2,420 square km -RRB- in the California desert , not much smaller than the state of Rhode Island , Twentynine Palms is the largest military base in the United States with some 8,000 active-duty personnel . 
The ill Marine , the first member of the U.S. armed forces reported by the military to have contracted the H1N1 virus , is being treated as an outpatient at the base and will remain isolated at his barracks . 
`` He is doing well , and his condition continues to improve , '' the base statement said . 
About 30 other Marines who had been `` active socially '' with him are being quarantined as well , the statement said . 
They will be permitted to return to full duty after five days if they display no flu-like symptoms , it added . 
`` The Marine Corps , along with all of the armed forces , is monitoring the health of our force to ensure we 're taking the necessary precautions to educate and safeguard military and civilian personnel , as well as family members , '' the statement said . 
At a Pentagon briefing earlier in the day , Marine Corps Commandant General James Conway said the ill Marine at Twentynine Palms had not been to Mexico , where as many as 159 deaths have been attributed to the virus . 
Two other major Marine bases in Southern California , Camp Pendleton and the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar , reported no suspected or confirmed cases of swine flu on Wednesday . 
In an unrelated case reported by the U.S. military , two 16-year-old boys described as military family members were treated at an Air Force base clinic in Texas last month for what turned out to be swine flu . 
The American Forces Press Service said those two cases were initially identified as part of the U.S. military 's worldwide influenza screening program .

2009-04-29,"\* 23-month-old child dies in Texas of swine flu \* Death is first outside Mexico and first in U.S. \* Official says child was in Houston for treatment By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A 23-month-old child has died in Texas from the new H1N1 swine flu , becoming the first death in the United States from the virus , a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said on Wednesday . 
A Houston health official said the child was a Mexican who traveled to the city for medical treatment . 
It is the first death from swine flu reported outside Mexico , the country hardest hit by this influenza outbreak . 
U.S. officials have confirmed 65 cases of swine flu , most of them mild but with five hospitalizations in California and Texas . 
`` Unfortunately , this morning I do have to confirm that we have the first death of a child from H1N1 flu virus . 
And this is in Texas , a 23-month-old child , '' Dr. Richard Besser , acting head of the CDC , told the CBS `` Early Show . '' 
`` The child came to Houston for medical treatment . 
The family had traveled to South Texas . 
The child became ill and they transported the child to Houston for medical care , '' Houston health department spokeswoman Kathy Barton told CNN by telephone . 
She said she did not know which part of Mexico the child came from . 
President Barack Obama , speaking at the White House before a one-day visit to Missouri , said the confirmed death underscored the urgency of taking steps against the disease . 
`` This is obviously a serious situation . 
Serious enough to take the utmost precautions , '' Obama said , urging state and local authorities to increase their vigilance . 
`` Every American should know that the federal government is prepared to do whatever is necessary to control the impact of this virus , '' he said . 
Besser of the CDC had predicted that as they searched for cases , CDC experts would find severe infections and deaths in the United States , even though most of the patients had mild illness . 
`` As we look , we 're going to find more cases . 
We 're going to find more severe cases and I expect that we 'll continue to see additional deaths , '' Besser told NBC 's `` Today '' show . 
He said additional details would be released by Texas authorities . 
Mexico previously had reported the only deaths -- 159 , based on symptoms and initial tests , with seven deaths so far confirmed by additional laboratory analysis at the World Health Organization . 
Influenza regularly kills people around the world , with an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 deaths from the seasonal virus every year . 
Every year at least a few perfectly healthy children die from seasonal influenza in the United States . 
WHO and CDC officials have been trying to assess just how serious the new H1N1 swine influenza strain is . 
It has been found globally , with cases across North America , Europe and New Zealand . 
`` We have about 100 cases outside Mexico , and now you have one death . 
That is very significant , '' said Lo Wing Lok , an infectious disease expert in Hong Kong . 
The CDC recommends frequent hand-washing to avoid infection with the new flu virus . 
It also recommends that people who are sick stay home , cover sneezes and coughs , and avoid unnecessary travel to Mexico until more is known . 
"
2009-04-29,"By Niu Shuping and Ken Wills Nevermind that the H1N1 `` swine '' flu , which has killed more than 150 people in Mexico , is not directly caused by pigs and has so far not led to any outbreaks among pigs . 
Nevermind that the World Health Organization has ruled out any risk of infection to humans from eating pork . 
Nevermind that the influenza-A virus contains DNA from avian and human as well as swine H1N1 viruses , but unfortunately -LRB- for the pork industry -RRB- has been tagged as `` swine flu '' by global health authorities and therefore by the media . 
The net result is that , amid the confusion and potential risks of appearing unprepared , at least six countries have decided to panic over pigs , imposing import bans on live pigs and pork products from Mexico and the United States . 
Indeed , the country with the largest pig population in the world -- China -- is going full-bore on a perceived threat to the domestic pig industry . 
China 's quaratine authority took immediate action by banning pork imports from Mexico as well as 3 states in the United States , vowing to destroy any pigs that arrived at its borders . 
On Tuesday , in a meeting hosted by Premier Wen Jiabao , China 's cabinet worked out an 8-point flu prevention strategy , including one to strengthen inspection to detect any outbreaks of swine flu among pigs and to strictly supervise trade of live pigs as well as some pig breeding areas . 
Why all this attention to pigs ? 
Agriculture Minister Sun Zhengcai said the possibility of the virus spreading to pigs can not be ruled out , although there was no mention that the avian portion of the virus 's DNA might also lead to an outbreak among poultry . 
To be fair , screening of people arriving at China 's airports has also been stepped up , though so far no human cases of the flu have been announced in the country . 
What is clear is that when the world 's most populous nation raises concerns about a staple food in the country 's diet , it most certainly will affect prices . 
Early signs are that consumers have begun to avoid pork , much to the dismay of breeders and others in the industry . 
In fact many farmers want to avoid publicity at all costs for fear that any further news coverage even to correct the misimpressions -- will hurt business . 
The Beijing News on Wednesday reported that pork prices in the capital have dropped significantly . 
It cited a pig breeder in a Beijing suburb , Li Wei , as saying he worries that consumers might shift to mutton or beef if the `` swine '' flu scare keeps spreading . 
Two years ago , China 's pork industry was racked by blue ear disease , which decimated pig numbers and caused prices to spike skyward . 
Since the start of the year , prices have been falling in response to subsidies Beijing offered to replenish supplies . 
Now they 're dipping faster , this time in part due to government efforts to protect the sector . 
Hopefully , when we look back , the sudden recent dip in pork prices will turn out to have been the worst of China 's casualties from the global flu scare .

REUTERS\/China Daily I think the Chinese government should act more tactfully in this politcal PR game . 
You ban Mexican pork and flights , they already reprised tit-fot-tat in kind . 
But if we as an integrated world community tender aid and relief to each other to irradicate such borderless virus , would n't we live with more mutual accommodation and less discrimination ? 
Swine flu originates from humans , not pigs . 
Never lay blame on ranch farmers . 
They are already going broke . 
I am in travel industry which is already battered by last year 's financial tsunami until now . 
Admittedly , this flu scare is over-exaggerated by mass media . 
The USA records just one death , whereas its total flu deaths amount to more than 200,000 every year . 
Now is just another rock dropped on us in a trapped pit . 
carrier and quarantine him merely because he presents a Mexican passport is simply `` racial profiling '' and is of course , downright discrimination which should be condemned by our civilized world .

2009-04-29,"LONDON | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 12:20 am BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to flu-hit Mexico on Tuesday as holiday firms started canceling flights and made plans to repatriate British tourists . 
A honeymooning Scottish couple who recently returned from Cancun , one of the country 's biggest beach resorts , have became the first in Britain to test positive for swine flu . 
On its website , the Foreign Office also said routine consular and all visa services at its embassy in Mexico City had been suspended until further notice . 
`` British nationals resident in or visiting Mexico may wish to consider whether they should remain in Mexico at this time , '' it said . 
Travel firms Thomson Holidays and First Choice said they had decided to repatriate their customers from Mexico and to cancel flights bound for Cancun from Gatwick and Manchester on Tuesday . 
Thomas Cook said it was canceling all flights to Mexico until May 5 , but British Airways said it would continue to operate its services . 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he would take part in a meeting of the government 's COBRA emergency committee on Tuesday chaired by Health Secretary Alan Johnson . 
`` We have been preparing for this kind of scenario for many years . 
Britain is among the best prepared countries in the world , '' he told a news conference during a visit to Poland . 
`` We , together with the World Health Organisation and our partners in Europe and internationally , will continue to take all the urgent action that is necessary to halt the spread of this virus . '' 
On Tuesday , newspapers named the Scottish couple who tested positive for the illness as newlyweds Iain and Dawn Askham from Polmont , near Falkirk , who had been on honeymoon in Cancun . 
They flew back to Scotland last week and are being treated in hospital in Airdrie , near Glasgow , Scotland 's health minister Nicola Sturgeon told reporters in Edinburgh on Monday . 
They are recovering well and Brown said it was hoped that one of them could return home later on Tuesday . 
Seven other people who came into contact with the two are receiving treatment for mild symptoms of the potentially deadly H1N1 virus . 
So far , 149 people have died , all in Mexico , and the virus has since also spread to the United States , Canada and Spain .

2009-04-29,"GENEVA | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 3:21 pm BST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The swine flu outbreak , which has killed up to 160 people , could be especially dangerous for millions of people already battling other infections , such as HIV or tuberculosis , health experts said . 
A 23-month-old child died in Texas on Wednesday , becoming the first death from swine flu outside Mexico , where the H1N1 strain raised alarms when it killed young adults who are normally more resilient than babies and the elderly . 
The virus has caused mainly minor symptoms in countries with confirmed infections outside Mexico , and the outbreak remains tiny in scale compared to other epidemics such as malaria , hepatitis , cholera and meningitis . 
However , as it continues to spread epidemiologists worry that swine flu could have a devastating impact on people whose immune systems are weak due to the AIDS virus or other diseases . 
World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- spokesman Gregory Hartl said adults who suffered severe pneumonia and died from the virus in Mexico may in fact have fallen into this category . 
`` It is a question which a lot of our scientists have been looking at , '' Hartl told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday , when asked why the deaths so far have been clustered in Mexico . 
`` Maybe people were infected with other illnesses too that made their illness more severe . 
Maybe they were immunologically suppressed , '' he said . 
According to WHO estimates , there are 33 million people infected with immune-weakening HIV worldwide , and another 9 million people are diagnosed with tuberculosis every year , a disease that only rears its head when immunity levels are low . 
If swine flu infiltrates those communities , and takes hold in impoverished and densely-populated areas such as urban slums , where tropical and other diseases are rife , health experts expect the outbreak could quickly become more severe . 
With health budgets already stretched by the global economic downturn , WHO officials are appealing to governments to keep ensuring HIV and tuberculosis patients get the drugs they need to stay strong , and to improve access to medical care and testing facilities in poor areas . 
`` Many of the world 's poorest people are particularly vulnerable to lethal airborne diseases , '' said Glenn Thomas , a spokesman for the Stop TB Partnership . 
`` With health resources already stretched in low income countries , a new disease pandemic could jeopardize effective TB control and other health programs , '' he said . 
WHO Acting Assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda stressed that while it is important to keep a close watch on swine flu -- in case it ramps up into a full-blown pandemic -- other epidemics and diseases need continued attention and care . 
But we are also mindful that even in this kind of situation other urgent health matters and issues do not go away , '' he said .

2009-04-29,"ROME | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 3:58 pm BST ROME -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italy 's first family soap opera was back on the front pages Wednesday after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 's wife said his party 's selection of women to run in European elections was a `` shamelessly trashy '' process . 
Veronica Berlusconi , who has publicly lamented her husband 's eye for younger women in the past , also accused him of going to the birthday bash of an 18-year-old woman in Naples but not attending the coming-of-age-parties of his own children . 
Veronica , 52 , who rarely appears with her husband , said she agreed with Italian newspapers ' descriptions of her husband 's party 's choice of female candidates as `` entertainment for the emperor , '' in what newspapers saw as a reference to him . 
The latest public clash between the Berlusconis , which dominated mainstream newspaper front pages along with swine flu and Fiat 's rescue of Chrysler , follows a media debate over `` starlets in politics . '' 
`` Women in Politics -- Veronica 's Wrath , '' was the way La Stampa of Turin put it . 
In an e-mail to Italian news agency Ansa , she praised politicians such as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and German Chancellor Angela Merkel and then added : `` But what 's happening today -LRB- in Italy -RRB- behind a front of bodily curves and female beauty is grave . '' 
She added that it offended all women and particularly those who had fought in the `` frontline '' for women 's equality . 
Her 72-year-old husband , speaking to reporters during a trip to Warsaw , said he was sorry his wife had apparently believed `` what she read in the papers '' and added that it was all `` a campaign -LRB- against him -RRB- hyped by the leftist press . '' 
The controversy exploded earlier this week when an on-line magazine close to Berlusconi 's main conservative ally , lower house speaker Gianfranco Fini , criticised how centre-right women candidates were being chosen for the June European elections . 
That article , seen by some media as a reference to Berlusconi 's party , said women politicians could not be used like `` pieces of costume jewellery '' to attract votes . 
Berlusconi 's People of Freedom party is considering a number of former actresses and television personalities as possible candidates in the June European election , media reports say . 
As party leader , he has a powerful voice in who makes the list . 
`` Some have written that it is all part of entertainment for the emperor . 
I agree , '' Veronica said . 
`` What is emerging from newspapers is shamelessly trashy , all in the name of power . '' 
Berlusconi told reporters in Warsaw it was `` absurd '' that women who speak several languages and have several degrees should consider themselves excluded from politics just because they had been on television or in show business . 
Veronica Berlusconi also took her husband to task for recently dropping in at the birthday party in Naples of an 18-year-old woman whose father is a political acquaintance . 
`` That surprised me very much too , '' Veronica said , `` Even because he never came to the 18th birthday parties of his children , even though he was invited . '' 
Berlusconi has three children with Veronica and two by his first marriage . 
He has been in hot water with her several times in the past in a very public way . 
Two years ago , she criticised him for flirting with young starlets at a party . 
He later issued a syrupy public apology in the press , saying : `` I beg you to forgive me . ''

Full Article Egypt orders cull of pig herds , U.N. says a mistake CAIRO | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 11:31 pm IST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Egypt , hit hard by bird flu , has ordered the slaughter of every pig herd in the country as a precaution against swine flu , a step the United Nations said was a mistake . 
The H1N1 swine flu virus is spread by people and is not present in Egyptian animals but culling pigs , largely viewed as unclean in Muslim Egypt , could help quell any panic . 
Twenty six people have died in Egypt from the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus and experts fear any flu pandemic could have a devastating impact in a country where most of the roughly 80 million people live in the densely packed Nile Valley , many in crowded slums in and around Cairo . 
But the United Nations said the mass cull of up to 400,000 pigs was `` a real mistake '' . 
`` There is no reason to do that . 
It 's not a swine influenza , it 's a human influenza , '' said Joseph Domenech , the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation 's chief veterinary officer , told Reuters . 
He said the FAO had been trying unsuccessfully to reach Egyptian officials . 
Pigs are mainly raised by Egypt 's Christian minority . 
In a statement earlier on Wednesday , Health Minister Hatem el-Gabali said : `` It is decided to slaughter all swine herds present in Egypt , starting from today . '' 
Cabinet spokesman Magdy Rady said Egypt would compensate farmers for their losses . 
Rady said swine farms in Egypt were in poor condition and constituted a health hazard . 
`` That 's why people are really getting afraid , '' he told Reuters before the decision was taken . 
Swine flu has killed up to 159 people in Mexico and one in the United States , and cases have also been reported in Europe as well as in neighbouring Israel . 
Egypt has not reported any cases , but has stepped up monitoring at airports . 
Egypt has been harder hit by the H5N1 bird flu virus than any other country outside Asia . 
Experts have long feared the bird flu virus could mutate into a form that spreads easily among people , sparking a pandemic that could kill millions . 
Egypt has suffered a surge in human cases of bird flu this month even as the flu season nears an end . 
Experts say the culling of pigs is unlikely to have an impact on the spread of swine flu if it reaches the country via air travellers . 
`` I would n't say it is beneficial for swine flu . 
It would be beneficial for the general hygiene ... Generally speaking , pigs can transmit many other diseases , '' Hussein Gezairy , regional director for the World Health Organization , told journalists . 
Mona Aly Mehrez , director of the state-run Animal Welfare Research Institute , said Egypt had long wanted to move pigs away from urban centres as a precaution due to the bird flu threat . 
But Rady said relocation , which would could six months , was not viable and Egypt wanted to remove even a theoretical risk . 
Experts say that it is technically possible but extremely unlikely that swine flu -- a mix of swine , human and avian flu -- could find a way to combine with H5N1 in Egypt to create yet another flu strain .

2009-04-29,"CHICAGO | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 10:56 pm BST CHICAGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Using a new tracking tool , search engine giant Google said on Wednesday it saw a spike in searches for information about flu among people in Mexico last week even before news of the outbreak became widely known . 
Google said it has put together a flu trends tracking system for Mexico based on the U.S. Google Flu tool launched last fall that is used by U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to figure out where influenza is heating up . 
It is based on Google 's observation that people who are sick with flu tend to search for the same types of information on the Internet , and these searches can be used to predict where an outbreak may be occurring . 
`` We have seen evidence in Mexico that Google users also search flu-related topics when they are experiencing flu-related symptoms , '' Jeremy Ginsberg , lead engineer for Flu Trends at Google , said in a telephone briefing . 
Studies show that between 35 and 40 percent of all visits to the Internet are started by people looking for health information . 
Ginsberg said the Mexican data have not been cross-checked with years of data on actual flu cases in Mexico like the U.S. flu tracker has , so the data may not be reliable . 
But he said the company is optimistic that the system , which generates maps based on peaks in flu-related searches , `` may reflect actual flu activity . '' 
`` We did see a small increase in many parts of Mexico before major news coverage began last week , '' he said . 
Ginsberg said people search for different things when they are sick -- like the word thermometer -- than they do when they are looking for news about flu outbreaks . 
Ginsberg said the group has also seen a spike in U.S.-related flu searches that correspond with increases in U.S. cases being reported . 
He said the hope is that the tool might offer one more way to predict hot spots in an outbreak as they happen . 
`` If it spreads quickly , it may give public health officials the chance to respond quickly , '' he said .

BRUSSELS | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 5:41 pm BST BRUSSELS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - What 's in a name ? 
A lot , when it comes to the H1N1 flu virus . 
Hoping to calm consumers and protect the pork industry , the European Union 's executive Commission is avoiding using `` swine flu '' to refer to the virus that has killed 159 people in Mexico and one in the United States . 
It prefers to say `` novel flu . '' 
Pork producers fear the term `` swine flu '' will not only cause consumption to fall but could also give countries an excuse to impose politically-motivated bans on meat imports . 
`` Not to have a negative effect on our industry , we decided to call it novel flu from now on , '' European Union Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou told reporters in Brussels . 
`` We know that the consumption of pork is safe ... -LRB- when -RRB- it is cooked , '' reiterating that there have been no cases of the virus being transmitted from pigs to humans . 
Despite the Commission 's public statements , EU sources said it had sent an internal document in which the term became confused . 
It referred to `` novel flu '' in English , `` Mexican flu '' in French and `` swine flu '' in German . 
Even so , EU members Slovenia , Italy and Spain , and veterinary authorities in the Czech Republic , have started avoiding `` swine flu . '' 
Italian media still use `` swine flu '' but the country 's authorities refer to `` the A\/H1N1 influenza virus . '' 
`` What we have is a media pandemic because calling it swine flu just pushes on the accelerator , causing unimaginable harm , '' Italian Agriculture Minister Luca Zaia said on Wednesday . 
The Czech veterinary authority prefers `` H1N1 '' or `` Mexican flu '' -- the term also used by Belgian authorities -- and the Hungarian government also faces pressure over the name . 
`` Panic-mongering , rather than the illness , causes a fall in demand -LRB- for pork -RRB- , '' Zoltan Forian , director of agricultural consultancy company Agrar-Europa Kft , told the daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet . 
Some producers are particularly concerned after Russia banned meat imports from North and South America . 
Former Cold War foes Washington and Moscow have in the past accused each other of using trade bans for political purposes . 
U.S. hog prices have fallen because of concerns the virus could weaken economies , slow trade and hurt meat consumption . 
Richard Bessert , acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States , said `` swine flu '' led to the misapprehension that people can catch the virus from pork . 
`` That 's not helpful to pork producers . 
That 's not helpful to people who eat pork . 
It 's not helpful to people who are wondering , how can they get this infection , '' Bessert said . 
Israel has its own reasons to oppose use of `` swine flu . '' 
Under Jewish dietary laws pigs are considered unclean and pork is a forbidden food , although the non-kosher meat is available in some stores in Israel . 
`` We will call it Mexico flu . 
We wo n't call it swine flu , '' Deputy Health Minister Yakov Litzman said .

2009-04-29,"Everything you wanted to know about swine flu John McConnell , an editor at The Lancet and founding Editor of The Lancet Infectious Diseases , is answering questions about the swine flu : What is the science behind how new flu strains arise this one has pig , human and bird components -LRB- mainly pig -RRB- . 
How has it got this way and how is it able to gain each of these components ? 
The basic science is explained on Wikipedia 's pandemic page in the epidemic and pandemic spread section . 
Quite how the current swine H1N1 acquired its genetic elements might take a while to work out and may never fully be understood Is there anyone who can talk about the discrepancy in the numbers -- why is the testing taking so long ? 
Are they re-testing samples ? 
Someone who could give us a perspective on where we are up to with this Testing isn t taking a long time . 
There are only a limited number of laboratories around the world that have the expertise to do virological typing . 
In the long term , if the epidemic spread and cases become more numerous , it is likely that only a limited number of suspected cases will be confirmed by typing . 
We are interested in how long it will take to come up with a viable vaccine for this particular strain of flu , and how long after that it could be massed produced . 
I d estimate 4-6 months to produce sufficient vaccine for a national population-wide immunisation program ... A decision to produce vaccine against H1N1 would not necessarily come at the expense of the seasonal flu vaccine , but we have nothing like the capacity to vaccinate the whole world s population and , as always , the poorest and most vulnerable people will be last in the queue for vaccine . 
We also are interested in the genomutability -- if that 's the correct term -- of this strain ; quite how much potential does it have to alter as it spreads . 
The flu virus is unstable and unpredictable . 
If anyone knows the answer to this question please let me know . 
However , there is no evidence that the virus will cause more serious disease as it spreads . 
If anything , disease morbidity is more likely to decrease in the long-term as population-wide -LRB- herd -RRB- immunity increases . 
I m also getting asked by the news editor whether this is all hype . 
Someone who can shed light on that would be very useful ! 
No , it s not all hype . 
My feeling , based on what we know so far , is that estimates of tens of millions of deaths are hype , but what we might see is a pandemic of relatively mild illness similar to the 1968 pandemic . 
The 1968 pandemic caused by the H3N2 flu virus is estimated to have caused an excess mortality of around 1 million people ie , equivalent to the mortality of about two annual flu seasons . 
However , I am definitely not predicting 1 million deaths from H1N1 because there is insufficient evidence on which to base a prediction . 
I am still looking at why there are deaths in Mexico and not elsewhere . 
The CDC says there are hospital admissions there and they expect deaths so does this support the iceberg theory that we were only seeing the worst cases reported in Mexico and if there are sufficient cases elsewhere we will see deaths there too . 
Every year , seasonal flu causes 250000-500000 deaths in vulnerable , and otherwise healthy , people . 
So it is likely we will see deaths outside Mexico from H1N1 . 
Indeed , the death of a 23-month-old child in Texas was reported this morning . 
Many mild cases may have gone unreported in Mexico , which , if this is the case , means that the death rate in Mexico is not as high as it appears to be . 
I received a flu shot last Nov. . 
Does that shot contain any benefit against this year 's Swine Flu virus ? 
Its hard to know who to believe -- one minute we are told its dying down and H1N1 is on the way out then we hear of more and more people with it -- over 1000 in the UK that are being screeded . 
Why is there not more preventive measures at schools and hospitals and public places ? 
The only thing I have seen and I have said this before is where a Headmaster brought in a vizexon bio-decontamination team to fog a school to prevent or at least help prevent students from catching the flu -- why dont more schools take this approach ?

2009-04-29,"WASHINGTON | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 6:57 pm BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Just how bad is this new flu strain , how far will it go and how long will the outbreak last ? 
Here are some questions and answers about the outbreak : HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED ? 
HOW MANY ARE INFECTED ? 
All deaths so far have been in Mexico , where 20 of the 149 reported fatalities have been confirmed to be from the H1N1 swine flu virus . 
There are 1,600 suspected cases in Mexico and 64 confirmed cases in the United States , and a few cases in Canada , New Zealand , Britain , Spain and Israel . 
WHY ARE THERE ONLY DEATHS IN MEXICO ? 
No one is sure . 
It is important to remember that health officials are now taking a snapshot of the past -- they are not reporting on new infections at this point , just tracking down old infections and they are only finding them where they are looking . 
The Mexican authorities looked in hospitals , where serious cases will , of course , be found . 
U.S. health officials found their cases during routine screening of people with flu-like symptoms , most in walk-in clinics , so they have naturally found milder cases . 
Influenza experts say they fully expect to find deaths in other places , including the United States and elsewhere , as the search goes on . 
One problem is that people die of respiratory diseases regularly and the cause is often not determined . 
WHY WOULD IT KILL SOME AND NOT OTHERS ? 
Seasonal influenza kills 250,000 to 500,000 people every year in a normal year and all sorts of factors determine who dies . 
Elderly people often die but sometimes perfectly healthy adults and children die . 
Sometimes flu makes people susceptible to bacterial infections , called secondary infections , and if the virus and the bacteria are circulating at the same time in the same place there can be clusters of deaths . 
WHAT KIND OF FLU IS IT AND HOW IS IT SPREADING ? 
The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 , but it contains DNA from avian , swine and human H1N1 viruses . 
It appears to have evolved the ability to pass easily from one person to another , unlike most swine H1N1 viruses which only very occasionally infect people and usually only infect one person and then stop there . 
Flu viruses are all passed on by sneezing , coughing or when people pick up the virus on their hands . 
This one likely originated in pigs , but the Mexican government and the World Health Organization have ruled out any risk of infection from eating pork . 
The Geneva-based WHO has declared the flu a `` public health emergency of international concern '' and raised the threat level for a pandemic , a global epidemic of new disease . 
H1N1 swine flu poses the biggest risk of a large-scale pandemic since avian flu re-emerged in 2003 , killing 257 out of 421 infected in 15 countries . 
It is not clear yet whether this virus could actually become a pandemic . 
HOW IS THIS FLU DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY FLU ? 
The swine flu is characterized by common flu symptoms -- sudden fever , muscle aches , sore throat and dry cough -- but may cause more severe vomiting and diarrhea . 
New flu strains can spread fast because no one has natural immunity and a vaccine can take months to develop . 
This strain is confusing because it is an H1N1 -- a type that has been around since the 1918 `` Spanish Flu '' pandemic that killed at least 40 million people globally . 
Usually if a new flu strain is related to one that has been around for years , people have some immunity and they no longer can cause pandemics . 
But this new strain has taken on genetic elements from animal viruses , and this may be genetically unique enough to pose a pandemic threat . 
HOW BAD COULD IT GET ? 
A 1968 a `` Hong Kong '' flu pandemic killed about one million people globally . 
The 1957-58 pandemic killed about 2 million . 
The 1918 pandemic killed between 40 million and 100 million , according to some estimates . 
However , the WHO says the world is now better prepared to withstand a flu pandemic . 
Vaccines and antiviral drugs are available that were not around during previous pandemics . 
In 1918 , there was a first wave of mild flu in April . 
It then seemed to disappear during the Northern Hemisphere 's summer but came back severely in August . 
WHO and CDC officials say it is possible this virus could behave in the same way , or completely differently . 
ARE THERE ENOUGH DRUGS AND VACCINES ? 
Most countries have been stockpiling supplies of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu , known generically as oseltamivir and made by Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc ; as well as Relenza , known generically as zanamivir and made by GlaxoSmithKline and Australia 's Biota Inc. . 
A third company , BioCryst Inc. is working to license its experimental flu drug peramivir . 
Older flu drugs called amantadine and rimantadine do not work very well any longer against any influenza strain except sometimes in combination with newer drugs . 
There is no vaccine yet against this new strain and health officials say the seasonal flu vaccine is unlikely to provide any protection against it . 
The CDC and WHO are working with companies to start making a new vaccine if it is needed , but the process takes months . 
It is proven to be the best way to protect against infection with a range of germs , including flu . 
Experts generally agree that face masks , especially the surgical masks now seen on the street of Mexico City , offer very little protection . 
Flu viruses can float on little particles of spit or mucus , in general no further than three to six feet , but they then settle on surfaces and can be transferred to the mouth , eyes or nose .

2009-04-29,"By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 7:30 pm BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new H1N1 swine flu has spread to nine countries , may have infected more than 2,500 people and killed dozens in Mexico , including a toddler from Mexico visiting Texas who became the first U.S. death . 
The World Health Organization says it can not be stopped and the best the world can do now is try to mitigate its effects . 
Although it is not yet a pandemic -- a global epidemic of a new and serious disease -- it could quickly start one . 
Here are a few ways the situation could develop : This is the worst-case scenario . 
Every 30-40 years the world suffers an influenza pandemic , with a new strain of flu spreading rapidly , causing serious disease and killing hundreds of thousands of people within a few weeks . 
The 1918 pandemic is considered the worst-case scenario . 
At least 40 million people died in 18 months and the epidemics passed over communities in waves . 
But that was in the pre-antibiotic era , in a time when even simple infections killed people , no mechanical ventilators were available and vaccines were primitive at best . 
The general population had little idea of how diseases were transmitted . 
Even so , experts predict a 1918-like flu would keep 40 percent of the workforce out at any time , with people either sick , caring for sick relatives or children out of school , or simply lying low . 
That would lead to shortages of supplies and even power outages . 
If this kind of pandemic struck today , millions could die , world trade would slow to a crawl and many economies would crumble . 
This last happened in 1968 . 
The H3N2 strain killed an estimated 1 million people . 
Experts predict that a strain of such virulence today would have less severe effects , with antivirals available that were not on the market 40 years ago . 
Even with vaccines , drugs and better public education , ordinary seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people every year . 
The difference with a pandemic strain is that there would not immediately be a vaccine against it and it would likely cause serious disease among broader age groups than the very young , very old and immune-compromised who are generally vulnerable to influenza . 
There could be disruptions to trade and travel , currency fluctuations , interruptions of supplies needed for manufacturing and a shortage of antivirals and the antibiotics needed to treat the `` co-infections '' that often accompany flu . 
Some reports predict a shortage of ventilators , and hospitals in many countries , especially the United States , already operate at full capacity and would be overwhelmed by an influx of newly sick people . 
Everyone is hoping this flu strain will just fizzle out . 
Influenza is a promiscuous virus , readily swapping genes with other flu viruses in a person 's or animal 's body . 
It also mutates constantly . 
Both these factors mean it can quickly grow worse , or become milder . 
It could at any time lose its ability to transmit easily from one person to another , or could become as mild as regular , seasonal flu . 
But it would take months to know whether this has happened . 
Flu strains often disappear over the summer months , re-emerging in late summer or early autumn . 
The 1918 flu strain did this with a vengeance . 
For now , the World Health Organization says only that a pandemic is possible . 
`` It 's probably premature to think of this as a mild pandemic , as a severe pandemic , '' the WHO 's Dr. Keiji Fukuda told a briefing on Wednesday . 
`` It is very clear that we can not predict what the course of this will be . ''

2009-04-29,"\* UN agency criticises Egypt order to cull pigs \* Says flu virus is human , not swine \* Renews calls to change `` swine flu '' name ROME , April 29 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Egypt 's order on Wednesday to cull all the country 's pigs is `` a real mistake '' and another reason why the world needs to rethink using `` swine flu '' to describe a virus affecting humans , a U.N. agency official said . 
Egypt , where pigs are mainly raised by the country 's Christian minority , described the order to slaughter the animals as a precautionary measure in a country hard hit by bird flu . 
Up to 400,000 pigs could be culled , a cabinet spokesman said . 
Joseph Domenech , the chief veterinary officer at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation , told Reuters his staff were trying to reach Egyptian authorities to correct any confusion about a virus that has killed humans but not been found in pigs . 
`` It 's a real mistake . 
There is no reason to do that . 
It 's not a swine influenza , it 's a human influenza , '' said Domenech , adding the FAO had been trying to reach Egyptian officials but has so far been unsuccessful . 
`` There is certainly no support from FAO for that decision . '' 
The new H1N1 flu strain -- a mixture of swine , human and avian flu viruses -- has killed up to 159 people in Mexico and a 23-month-old boy in the United States . 
But since no pigs have been found with the disease , groups like the FAO and the Paris-based Organisation for Animal Health -LRB- OIE -RRB- are lobbying for a name change . 
`` This is one of the results of this strange way of defining the disease as a swine influenza . 
That 's why the FAO and OIE are fighting to get that name changed because it 's a totally undue focus on swine , '' he said . 
Egypt , harder hit by the H5N1 bird flu virus than any other country outside Asia , is deeply worried about the effects of another flu virus after extensive damage to its poultry industry and economy . 
Egypt 's al-Ahram newspaper said owners of culled pigs could receive 1,000 Egyptian pounds -LRB- $ 177 -RRB- per animal in compensation , although an Egyptian cabinet spokesman said the issue was still under discussion .

2009-04-29,"GENEVA | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 7:31 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organization said on Wednesday the world is at the brink of a pandemic , raising its threat level as the swine flu virus spread and killed the first person outside of Mexico , a toddler in Texas . 
`` Influenza pandemics must be taken seriously precisely because of their capacity to spread rapidly to every country in the world , '' WHO Director General Margaret Chan told a news conference in Geneva as she raised the official alert level to phase 5 , the last step before a pandemic . 
`` The biggest question is this : how severe will the pandemic be , especially now at the start , '' Chan said . 
But she added that the world `` is better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history . '' 
Nearly a week after the H1N1 swine flu virus first emerged in California and Texas and was found to have caused dozens of deaths in Mexico , Spain reported the first case in Europe of swine flu in a person who had not been to Mexico , illustrating the danger of person-to-person transmission . 
Both U.S. and European officials have said they expect to see swine flu deaths . 
Despite worries that a major flu outbreak could hit the struggling global economy , world stocks rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said the U.S. recession appeared to be easing . 
Almost all cases outside Mexico have had mild symptoms , and only a handful have required hospitalization . 
`` We doubt that the markets will react with the same worry as found during avian flu scares in the past , '' said Citigroup analyst Tobias Levkovich in New York . 
Chan also urged companies who make the drugs to ramp up production . 
Two antiviral drugs -- Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKlin and Tamiflu , made by Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc. -- have been shown to work against the H1N1 swine flu strain . 
Drugmakers have donated millions of doses of their drugs to the WHO . 
She also alerted governments to be ready to distribute stockpiles of their drugs . 
Vaccine makers were on standby to begin making a new vaccine if needed . 
In Mexico , where up to 159 people have died from the virus and around 1,300 more are being tested for infection , people struggled with an emergency that has brought normal life virtually to a standstill over the past week . 
`` I 'm depressed . 
I do n't understand where this came from , how it spreads , how long it will last or what it will to the economy , '' said an elderly woman named Licha , sitting on a Mexico City park bench and wearing a surgical mask . 
Germany and Austria reported cases of the illness , bringing the number of affected countries to 9 . 
Texas officials said a 22-month-old boy had died -- the first confirmed U.S. swine flu death -- while on a family visit from Mexico . 
In the Texas border city of Brownsville , where the young Mexican was first diagnosed and many residents have families on both sides of the Rio Grande river border , some residents said they were now reluctant to venture south to Mexico . 
`` I am extremely concerned because you could die , '' said Santiago Perez , 18 , a student at Pace High School . 
About 30 U.S. Marines in southern California on the biggest military base in the United States were quarantined after one was confirmed to have contracted the illness . 
President Barack Obama , facing the sudden flu emergency along with his broader drive to pull the United States out of its deep recession , said the Texas death showed it was time to take `` utmost precautions . '' 
Kathleen Sebelius , Obama 's newly confirmed health secretary , spent her first day in office on a rapid-fire media tour as the administration sought to calm public fears while urging public health vigilance . 
`` We know that the cases will continue to rise , '' Sebelius said . 
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the Customs and Border Patrol was keeping an eye out for sick travelers , as usual , and had checked 49 people with flu-like symptoms . 
She said 41 had been cleared of H1N1 infection and eight were still being studied . 
`` We are preparing for the worst ; hoping for the best , '' Napolitano said . 
`` All of us should be dusting off our business contingency plans , looking at things like telecommuting and the like so that things keep operating . '' 
Many Americans were heeding the warnings , snapping up hand sanitizers , wipes and soap . 
`` I figure it 's going to get worse before it gets better , right ? '' 
said Kathy Ivcich , 53 , a real estate agent in Chicago . 
Mexico 's central bank warned the outbreak could deepen the nation 's recession , hurting an economy that already shrank by as much as 8 percent from the previous year in the first quarter . 
France said it would seek a European Union ban on flights to Mexico . 
The EU , the United States and Canada have advised against non-essential travel to Mexico , a popular tourist destination , with many of the cases linked to travel there . 
Many tourists already in Mexico were hurrying to leave , crowding airports and trying to change their tickets . 
`` We did n't want to get stuck here , '' said Australian Alex Grinter , who left her beach vacation in the southern state of Oaxaca to get an early flight to Vancouver . 
In Mexico City , a metropolis of 20 million , all schools , restaurants , nightclubs and public events have been shut down to try to stop the sickness from spreading . 
H1N1 swine flu is seen as the biggest risk since H5N1 avian flu re-emerged in 2003 , killing 257 people of 421 infected in 15 countries . 
In 1968 a `` Hong Kong '' flu pandemic killed about 1 million people globally , and a 1957 pandemic killed 2 million . 
Seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people in a normal year , including healthy children in rich countries .

2009-04-30,"Eight cases of swine flu have emerged in the UK Two more people in London have been diagnosed with the swine flu virus , the Department of Health -LRB- DH -RRB- confirmed . 
The 23-year-old man from Islington , north London , and 29-year-old man from Westminster , central London , have mild symptoms , the DH said . 
They are being treated at their homes and are among eight people in the UK known to have caught the H1N1 virus . 
Doctors said a 22-year-old man from Barnet , north London , was responding well to treatment for the virus . 
The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- said it was investigating 230 possible cases , all of which were associated with travel to Mexico . 
It added that people exposed to a `` probable or confirmed '' case of swine flu in the past seven days , for more than one hour and within a distance of 1m -LRB- 3.2 ft -RRB- have been offered anti-viral drugs `` as a precautionary measure '' . 
A DH spokesman said : `` The preparations we have in place and are continuing to make will help to ensure we respond well in the event of a pandemic . '' 
Transport warning over swine flu Swine flu is a respiratory disease , caused by influenza type A , which infects pigs . 
Until now it has not normally infected humans , but the latest form of the virus can . 
The man from Barnet caught the virus during a recent visit to Mexico and was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead on Wednesday . 
A spokesman for the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust said he was `` brought to the trust in a secure , specialist ambulance '' . 
`` Staff are scrupulously following infection control procedures to ensure no other patient or member of staff is at risk , '' he added . 
London authorities said they were working closely with other agencies to monitor and deal with any issues from the outbreak . 
London Councils ' Chairman Councillor Merrick Cockell said : `` London 's local authorities have been preparing for the possible outbreak of a flu pandemic for the last five years so are primed to respond to any issues arising as a result of swine flu in the capital . '' 
"
2009-04-30,"Guards at the border crossing in El Paso are still being kept busy El Paso is a border town in more than just name . 
It is where the Mexican and American cultures merge into a colorful mixture of language , culture and food . 
Tex-Mex is the predominant dining experience here . 
It is also one of North America 's largest and most important border crossings . 
Each day , about 100,000 people crowd onto four small bridges , making their way from Ciudad Juarez into El Paso . 
Essentially , this is one city that happens to have two names . 
The situation here is starkly different from that of Mexico City . 
Instead of empty streets and orders not to gather in large numbers , people here are huddled together on the bridges in huge numbers on a daily basis . 
The fact is that most have to make the crossing . 
They study at the university , work or have family here . 
The need to keep making a living seems to be outweighing fears about the H1N1 virus . 
There 's no way to monitor folks if they decide to cross from Mexico to the United States There is also some anger among residents . 
Many people feel that they are not being given enough information and few are bothering with paper masks . 
On the border , though , agents say they are carrying out a procedure known as `` passive surveillance '' . 
It means that if anyone is seen with symptoms of the virus he or she can be pulled to one side and possibly quarantined . 
Although there has been a great deal of talk about closing the borders , such a move seems highly unlikely . 
President Barack Obama has acknowledged that isolating America and closing an economically important border is not feasible . 
`` I 've consulted with our public health officials extensively on a day-to-day basis , in some cases an hour-to-hour basis . 
At this point , they have not recommended a border closing , '' he said . 
`` From their perspective , it would be akin to closing the barn door after the horses are out , because we already have cases here in the United States . '' 
On Thursday , an entire school district in Texas was closed down as a precaution and 80,000 children were sent home . 
The first death in the US also happened in this state . 
A hundred miles east of El Paso , in the tiny town of Fort Hancock , there are no high security fences and security cameras . 
Like much of the border between the US and Mexico , there are plenty of places to cross , albeit illegally . 
`` We 're not out here 24\/7 , '' says Deputy Sheriff Robert Wilson , who patrols the border as part of his duties . 
`` There 's no way to monitor folks if they decide to cross from Mexico to the United States and if someone was infected with the disease then they would enter into the United States undetected . '' 
The situation here is evolving rapidly , but there is also a measured calm . 
People on both sides of the border are concerned , and perhaps a little frustrated , that more information is not being given out . 
But there is also a need , primarily driven by basic economics , for Mexicans and Americans to keep on crossing this and other borders . 
Mexico City , to many , feels like a distant place . 
But as schools close and the number of confirmed cases inevitably rises , it is getting closer .

2009-04-30,"cents One sufferer in Newcastle and two in London Thursday 30 April 2009 19.10 BST Watch the Department of Health advert showing how to prevent swine flu Link to video : Department of Health releases advert showing how to prevent swine flu Three new cases of swine flu have been diagnosed in the UK , one in the north-east and two in London , making eight in total , the Department of Health said today . 
All three new British victims are said to have mild symptoms and to be responding to treatment at home . 
The Health Protection Agency said 230 possible other cases were under investigation in the UK . 
In Scotland , the health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said it was `` probable '' that one of the people in contact with honeymooners Iain and Dawn Askham had contracted the disease . 
If so , he would be the first person to be diagnosed who had not traveled to Mexico recently . 
Sturgeon said : `` If this case was confirmed it would be the first case in Scotland of onward transmission , but I stress it 's not confirmed at this stage . '' 
She said the person , a male , had tested positive for type A flu and was having further tests to determine whether it was H1N1 . 
The new victim from the north-east , who had recently returned from Mexico , shares a house with two Newcastle University students living off-campus , the university said today . 
It said it had spoken to the Health Protection Agency and had decided not to shut down . 
In a statement , the university said : `` Neither of the students concerned has so far displayed any flu-like symptoms . 
Both students have received the anti-viral Tamiflu , and they and the university have been advised by the Health Protection Agency that there is no need for the students to isolate themselves from the community unless they show symptoms . '' 
Ireland also reported its first probable case of swine flu this afternoon , a man who has recently returned from Mexico . 
The chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said tests had shown the man had Influenza A , and he was now being tested for H1N1 . 
Pat Wall , professor of public health at University College Dublin , said the case was `` likely to be positive '' . 
The latest cases came as the UK 's chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , said today he was `` concerned but not alarmed '' after the World Health Organisation raised its swine flu global epidemic threat level to phase five , the second highest . 
He said the UK would see `` many more cases '' of swine flu but most people would make a good recovery . 
From next Tuesday , all UK households will receive an information leaflet on swine flu outlining the Department of Health 's to encourage people to use tissues when they sneeze . 
The first Britons confirmed with swine flu have left hospital and are `` very well '' , Scotland 's first minister , Alex Salmond , said today . 
The Askhams had been treated in an isolation ward after falling ill after their honeymoon in Mexico . 
A second newlywed couple who feared they had contracted swine flu in Mexico were among those given the all-clear . 
Pete and Jenny Marshall had been on honeymoon in Canc n , the same resort as the Askhams , and reported flu-like symptoms and other illnesses . 
After the three British cases of swine flu confirmed yesterday the Department of Health stepped up its emergency response with plans to purchase additional stocks of antiviral drugs and face masks . 
Those three Britons a 12-year-old girl from Paignton , Devon ; a 41-year-old woman from Redditch , Worcestershire ; and a 22-year-old man from north-west London had recently returned from Mexico . 
The child was on the same flight into Birmingham as the Askhams . 
Her school , Paignton community college , has been closed for a week . 
All 267 pupils in her school year and all teachers who might have come into contact with her have been given the antiviral drug Tamiflu , the college principal , Jane English , told a press conference today . 
English said the girl attended school on Wednesday to Friday last week after returning from holiday but had not been in since . 
Dr Sarah Harrison , a public health consultant for Torbay Care trust , said of the afflicted pupil : `` She is suffering from flu , so she 's not feeling very well , but she 's improving . '' 
She said 340 courses of Tamiflu had been given out in Devon and dozens of people were being monitored for the virus in the area . 
Chemists in Torbay were selling out of face masks , nasal sprays and hand washes today . 
A spokesman for Crossways pharmacy , also in Paignton , said : `` Our customers are very keen to take precautionary measures against swine flu . 
So far we have sold out of medicated hand gels and completely sold out of face masks . 
We sold out within hours of the first case in Torbay being announced . '' 
"
2009-04-30,"Swine flu and the lessons of 1918 The response to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 offers clues to how we should deal with swine flu And lo it came to pass . 
Four years ago , Sir Liam Donaldson predicted that a new pandemic was `` inevitable '' . 
`` It 's happened before , in 1918 , 1958 and 1969 , '' the chief medical officer informed Andrew Marr on the BBC 's Sunday AM program . 
`` These things come in natural cycles , once every 10 to 40 years . '' 
It will be little comfort to Donaldson that he is on the brink of being proven right and right on cue . 
The Mexican strain of swine flu now sweeping the world is a pandemic in all but name we are only awaiting the formal declaration from the WHO . 
As someone who has spent the last five years studying mutating strains of influenza first in the field as a correspondent for the Observer and the Guardian , latterly as a historian based at the Wellcome Trust , I take no pleasure in being proven similarly prescient . 
If history teaches us anything it is that the past is not necessarily a guide to the future . 
But based on the events of the last few days , the parallels with 1918 the last great pandemic may be unavoidable . 
Mexican swine flu is a H1N1 hybrid consisting of pig , human and avian genes . 
The 1918 pandemic virus was also a H1N1 hybrid containing a mix of avian and non-avian genes . 
It now appears that an unusual cluster of influenza-like illnesses which have been the index cases of Mexican swine flu erupted in La Gloria in Veracruz in early April , a highly unusual time of year for an outbreak of influenza in the northern hemisphere . 
In 1918 , the earliest reports of what would prove to be the pandemic strain also came from the Americas , from Haskell County , Kansas , where doughboys at a US army base were being fattened on chickens and pork grown on local farms before crossing the Atlantic to reinforce the allied lines . 
And in 1918 as now there were also reports of young adults , men and women in their early 20s and 30s , falling prey to unusual pneumonias . 
So what should we make of the reports of the growing morbidity and morality from Mexico , and should we be worried ? 
In recent days , I have found myself being asked this continually in interviews with CNN , the BBC and Sky . 
I do not have a good answer yet . 
Three thousand children die of malaria every day in Africa , I want to say . 
But that 's no good because malaria is hardly a disease that is likely to bite you in Britain . 
But once again HIV , rightly or wrongly , is only perceived as a threat to `` high risk '' groups . 
The point is that influenza is an aerosol infection , as ubiquitous as air and as hard to avoid as breathing itself . 
But we need to and must keep things in perspective . 
Some 10,000 people die of influenza every year in Britain during the normal winter flu season . 
So far the Mexican flu has killed a grand total of just 160 people worldwide . 
Even if Mexican swine flu does prove to be a so-called Armageddon strain and , as I write , that is still a very big if there is every reason to believe we will cope , as long as we learn from and can avoid the mistakes of 1918 . 
In 1918 , Britain did not have a national health service , nor was there a ministry of health to coordinate the national response to the Spanish influenza so-called because Spain , not being party to the war , saw no need to censor news of the spreading depredation -LRB- by contrast , British newspapers , perhaps for the sake of national morale , treated the `` Spanish Lady '' as something of a joke -RRB- . 
Nor in 1918 did we possess antiviral drugs , antibiotics or a vaccine hardly surprising given that in 1918 the scientific consensus was that influenza was caused by a bacteria , not a virus . 
We did , however , possess a highly militarised economy , one that , should the authorities have so desired , could have been drilled to take the threat more seriously . 
But there was a war to win and the government did not wish to panic the populace . 
Instead , Britain 's then chief medical officer , Sir Arthur Newsholme , decreed that national circumstances dictated that Britons should `` carry on '' a message that the Times and other establishment organs were happy to iterate . 
Today , of course , we live in a very different world . 
Thanks to the internet and 24\/7 rolling news channels , information about epidemic diseases travels far faster than a virus can ever hope to , and competition between papers means that hysterical , unscientific claims are ubiquitous . 
The result is a sort of media-induced collective dread a sickness of the soul far in excess of the actual threat to our bodies . 
So , to the return to the question that Simon Mayo posed to me on Radio 5 Live on Tuesday : what should we do ? 
Well , for starters , we could do worse than to follow Newsholme 's advice in 1918 to stay calm and to `` carry on '' . 
Secondly , for all our sophisticated drugs and medical technology , we may find that some of the most effective measures are the simplest . 
In 1918 , when the LGB was finally girded into action late on in the pandemic , Newsholme advised people to avoid sneezing and coughing in public , and to keep plenty of fresh handkerchiefs on hand -LRB- the handkerchief to be `` boiled , or burned if of paper '' -RRB- . 
Other simple hygiene measures included washing one 's hands and gargling with a disinfectant mouthwash . 
I have yet to see Donaldson or Alan Johnson issue the last item of advice , but in every other respect they have repeated Newsholme 's formulations to the letter . 
Now , the Department of Health is also taking a leaf from the book of an even more heroic 1918 figure . 
In June of that awful year , while the majority of his countrymen were doing their best to ignore the threat from Spain , James Niven , the medical officer of health for Manchester , had 35,000 handbills printed and distributed throughout the city spelling out in clear and easy-to-understand English the dangers of influenza and giving strict instructions for the isolation of the sick . 
In November , when the second deadly wave of the pandemic swept through Britain , he went a stage further , printing more handbills and posting warnings throughout the city urging people to avoid trams and unventilated assembly halls . 
Niven 's proactive measures delayed the onset of influenza in Manchester , buying the city valuable time . 
The result was that when the virus returned as Niven knew it would just 1,700 Mancunians lost their lives . 
By contrast , in London , where some boroughs closed their schools and others prevaricated , some 10,000 people died . 
There is no reason , as yet , to believe that we are on the brink of a similar disaster . 
Having said that if the Department of Health 's `` Catch it , bin it , kill it '' campaign launched today can prevent even one unnecessary death , then the further ratcheting up of public anxieties will surely be a price worth paying . 
Time for a ban .

2009-04-30,"The WHO has raised its pandemic alert level as Mexico is shut down for five days and new suspected cases of swine flu have been announced in Peru and Switzerland . 
Follow the latest updates and reactions to the spread of the virus These are the main developments overnight : The UK government is about to launch its public information film about the dangers of swine flu . 
Here is some possible inspiration from previous flu alerts from the YouTube archive : `` Sneeze , handkerchief , got it '' from a 1948 NHS film .

The World Bank says a Washington-based employee has been `` preliminarily diagnosed '' with the swine flu -LRB- or the H1N1 flu , as politically correct types are saying here -RRB- . 
The infection is believed to have resulted from exposure while on business travel in Mexico between April 14-18 , before Mexican health authorities and the WHO recognized and announced the epidemic . 
The final diagnosis has to be confirmed by a second test performed by the Center for Disease Control , a process which is underway .

AP is reporting that US public health officials are intercepting migrant seasonal workers entering the country from Mexico and handing them information on swine-flu symptoms and prevention tips . 
Health officials worry the migrant workers , who provide essential labor for industries like seafood and meat packing , construction and landscaping , may bring the swine flu virus into the states with them and spread it . 
The WHO is now referring to the bug as influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , not swine flu , probably out of deference to the global pork industry and to avoid giving the impression that the disease can be caught from pigs .

2009-04-30,"ZURICH | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 6:12 am EDT ZURICH -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG will use data from a study on its pre-pandemic bird flu vaccine Aflunov and adjuvant MF59 to help develop a vaccine against the swine flu virus , it said on Thursday . 
Adjuvants are additives that help boost the effectiveness of vaccines . 
A study showed that when MF59 was added to Aflunov it can provide a broadly-cross reactive immune response covering all known H5N1 antigenic variants , even when that booster dose is administered six years after the initial dose . 
Manufacturers have started to take the first preparatory steps in developing a vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu virus that is being linked to the deaths of as many as 176 people in Mexico . 
Ten countries have reported cases of the H1N1 strain . 
`` These data reinforce the potentially broad applicability of the MF59 adjuvant and the role it can play in pandemic preparedness efforts around the world , '' said Andrin Oswald , chief executive of Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics . 
`` We will use these new insights , as well as our strong leadership position in cell based flu manufacturing , as part of our efforts to develop a vaccine against the current swine flu outbreak , '' Oswald said . 
By 0718 GMT , shares in the group had risen 1.3 percent to 43.28 , largely in line with the European pharmaceuticals sector . 
Novartis said earlier this week it had received the genetic code of the new virus strain , meaning that it could start work on evaluating production and it hoped to get the actual virus in its laboratories in the near future . 
The group also said on Thursday a Phase II study had shown that Aflunov provided a protective immune response in children from 6 months to 17 years , making it the first and only pre-pandemic avian vaccine with a good safety profile and which is effective in building an immune response as early as 6 months .

2009-04-30,"MEXICO CITY | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 7:30 pm EDT MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mexico began shutting down parts of its economy on Thursday to slow the spread of a new flu strain as officials urged increased worldwide precautions against an imminent pandemic . 
The World Health Organization said it would remain for now at its current alert level -- one step below full pandemic -- and that it would no longer refer to the H1N1 virus as `` swine flu '' to appease beleaguered meat producers . 
New confirmed flu cases were reported in the United States , Canada and Europe , although a case in Peru , which would have been the first confirmed case in Latin America outside of Mexico , was later discounted . 
Almost all cases outside of Mexico have been mild , only a handful of patients have required hospital treatment , and most global markets have shrugged off concerns . 
But the case count continues to rise , and officials say there are many unanswered questions about the outbreak . 
U.S. officials said new infections were occurring and at least 298 U.S. schools closed around the country because of possible infections . 
Canada recorded its first case of person-to person transmission of the virus . 
In Mexico , the worst hit country with up to 176 deaths , President Felipe Calderon told government offices and private businesses not crucial to the economy to stop work beginning on Friday to avoid further spreading a virus that is striking across age and class lines . 
`` There is no safer place than your own home to avoid being infected with the flu virus , '' Calderon said in his first televised address since the outbreak started . 
In Mexico City , where the virus has already brought public life to a standstill , some were skeptical while others vowed not to take part in the shutdown . 
`` Closing businesses is not right and not fair . 
What are we going to live on ? 
said Andres Garcia , who works in a tailor shop in the old colonial center of the capital . 
Mexico 's assembly for export factories known as maquiladoras , a pillar of the economy , said it would defy the shutdown call while some of the country 's mines also vowed to stay in operation . 
`` We have commitments that we have to meet , and if we do n't meet them , the cure will end up being worse than the disease , '' council head Cesar Castro told reporters . 
With its tourism industry savaged , shoppers staying home and exports to the United States in steep decline , Mexico could find itself in the longest , deepest recession it has seen in years , according to analysts . 
Mexico 's peso was hammered by flu fears on Thursday and its stock market slid . 
But most global markets were taking the flu news in stride as traders focused on hopes that a deep U.S. recession may be nearing its end . 
`` The information that we have at this stage is it is a relatively minor -LRB- economic -RRB- event , '' International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard said , although he added that some countries and sectors could see `` quite dramatic '' fallout from the outbreak . 
Previous studies at the World Bank have said a severe flu pandemic which triggers a clampdown on trade could cost the global economy trillions of dollars . 
The WHO and flu experts say they do not yet know enough about this new strain to say how deadly it actually is , how far it might spread and how long any potential pandemic may last . 
Flu epidemics generally last a few weeks or months in any single community , and can pass around the world in one or two waves over 18 months to two years before fading out . 
U.S. officials have reported 109 confirmed swine flu infections in at least 11 states and the only death recorded outside of Mexico -- a Mexican toddler visiting Texas . 
The White House said on Thursday that a member of the advance team that went with Obama to Mexico had also come down with flu-like symptoms and passed them to his family , although all of them had recovered . 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a public webcast there were still many unanswered questions . 
`` We know what happens year in , year out with seasonal flu . 
What we do n't know is if this is going to be more virulent or milder , '' she said . 
Normal seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people around the globe in an average year , including about 36,000 in the United States . 
Worldwide , 11 countries have reported confirmed cases of the H1N1 strain , with the Netherlands the latest to join the list . 
It said a 3-year-old who had recently returned from Mexico had contracted the virus . 
Switzerland also confirmed its first case on Thursday in a man returning from Mexico . 
Peru 's health minister Oscar Ugarte told Reuters that further tests on a suspected case there had determined it was not the new flu strain . 
Flu preparations were intensified after the WHO raised its alert level to phase 5 , the last step before a pandemic . 
The WHO recommended all countries track any suspect cases and ensure medical workers dealing with them wear protective masks and gloves . 
But it stopped short of recommending travel restrictions , border closures or any limitation on the movement of people , goods or services . 
Keiji Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director-general , told reporters there was no new evidence to prompt the agency to move to its top alert level which would signal a global pandemic was under way . 
Fukuda said Swiss drugmaker Roche was stepping up production of Tamiflu to deal with the infection at that the WHO had released some of its own stockpiles of the drug -- known generically as oseltamivir and proven effective against the new strain -- to developing countries deemed most at need , including Mexico . 
The World Bank also announced it was beginning to transfer flu emergency funds to Mexico and Argentina .

2009-04-30,"Thu Apr 30 , 2009 5:11 am EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Here are some facts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how swine flu spreads in humans : \* Swine flu viruses typically cause illness in pigs , not humans . 
Most cases occur when people come into contact with infected pigs or contaminated objects moving between people and pigs . 
\* Pigs can catch human and avian or bird flu . 
When flu viruses from different species infect pigs , they can mix inside the pig and new , mixed viruses can emerge . 
\* Pigs can pass mutated viruses back to humans , and these can be passed from human to human . 
Transmission among humans is thought to occur in the same way as with seasonal flu -- by touching something contaminated with flu viruses and then touching one 's mouth or nose , and through coughing or sneezing . 
One of the most effective prevention measures is regular hand washing . 
\* Symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to those of seasonal influenza -- sudden fever , coughing , muscle aches and extreme fatigue . 
This new strain also appears to cause more diarrhea and vomiting than normal flu . 
\* Vaccines are available to be given to pigs to prevent swine influenza . 
There is no vaccine to protect humans from swine flu , although the CDC is formulating one . 
The seasonal influenza vaccine may help to provide partial protection against swine H3N2 , but not against swine H1N1 viruses like the one circulating now . 
\* People can not catch swine flu from eating pork or pork products . 
Cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- 71 degrees Celsius -RRB- kills the swine flu virus along with other bacteria and viruses .

2009-04-30,"GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- , bowing to pressure from meat industry producers and concerned governments , said on Thursday it would refer to a deadly new virus strain as influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , not swine flu . 
The new strain has infected 257 people . 
The WHO has confirmed eight deaths although many more people are suspected to have died from the virus . 
It derives from a swine influenza virus but the new strain has been found only in people . 
While it contains mostly swine flu genetic sequences , it also contains small amounts of human and bird flu virus genetic material . 
No pigs have been confirmed to be sick with it . 
WHO has consistently said the disease can not be caught from eating pork if it is prepared properly . 
`` There is also no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of well-cooked pork and pork products , '' it said on its website on Thursday . 
The name of the flu led several countries to ban imports of pork from Mexico and the United States , where the outbreak first appeared , and authorities in Egypt have ordered a cull of pigs . 
U.S. and European food industries and governments had been calling for a change in name to remove the link in people 's minds between the disease and pigs . 
The `` influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- '' designation refers to a family of flu strains , including one of the current seasonal strains and the strain that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 40 million people or more .

2009-04-30,"CAIRO | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 9:44 am EDT CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Egypt started seizing and slaughtering herds of pigs on Thursday as a precaution against swine flu , officials and farmers said , despite resistance by farmers and criticism from the United Nations . 
Egypt , already hit hard by bird flu , fears another flu virus could spread quickly in a country where most of the roughly 80 million population live in the densely packed Nile Valley , many in crowded slums around Cairo . 
But the United Nations said the mass cull of up to 400,000 pigs was `` a real mistake '' because the new strain -- a mix of swine , avian and human viruses -- has not been found in pigs . 
Farmers in the most populous Arab country said the state had begun confiscating animals . 
State news agency MENA said Egypt had also culled thousands of birds as a precaution . 
`` They have destroyed us . 
The pigs were our livelihood , '' said 21-year-old Hanan Ahmed , whose family runs a small farm with around 25 pigs in Cairo . 
`` They took them . 
And they beat them and us . 
They said they will take them to the slaughterhouse and kill them there , '' she added , saying she had received no compensation . 
The H1N1 swine flu virus is spread by people , not pigs . 
But culling swine , largely viewed as unclean in Muslim Egypt , could help quell any public panic . 
Pigs are mainly raised by the country 's Christian minority . 
Dozens of pigs were killed in the early phase of the cull . 
In the southern village of Deir Abu Hennes , workers suffocated 25 piglets in plastic sacks and killed dozens of adult pigs and gave the meat to their owners , a local official said . 
Some farmers there took their pigs to a graveyard to try to hide them from authorities , but the animals were found and killed on the spot , the official and residents said . 
Swine flu has killed up to 176 people in Mexico and one in the United States , and cases have also been reported in Peru , Canada , Europe , Israel and New Zealand . 
Egypt has not reported any cases , but has stepped up monitoring at airports . 
Agriculture Minister Amin Abaza said authorities had already confiscated more than 1,000 pigs despite efforts by some farmers to hide the animals . 
He said the pigs would be slaughtered and their meat would be frozen . 
Abaza said he was seeking the army 's help with the slaughter , which Egyptian state media reported could take up to a month to complete . 
In one slaughterhouse near Cairo , workers wearing masks used their boot-clad feet to hold down the snouts of pigs while they tested them for illness prior to slaughter . 
`` The issue of slaughtering more than 300,000 heads of pig is a difficult one , especially since private pig slaughterhouses are not enough . 
We will seek the help of armed forces slaughterhouses , '' Abaza told Reuters . 
`` The meat will be preserved in freezers after it is removed from the bones and will be offered for sale to consumers , '' he said . 
Egyptian officials have stressed that while they believed there was a need for a cull , the meat was safe . 
An official from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said on Wednesday his group had been trying unsuccessfully to reach Egyptian officials to correct any confusion about the virus . 
The Paris-based Organization for Animal Health said states should focus efforts on `` appropriate disease surveillance '' and strengthening biosecurity measures at premises where pigs are handled and slaughtered , rather than culling them . 
`` The culling of pigs will not help to guard against public or animal health risks presented by this novel A\/H1N1 influenza virus and such action is inappropriate , '' the organization said in a statement . 
Egypt 's state-run al-Ahram newspaper has said pig owners could receive 1,000 Egyptian pounds -LRB- $ 177 -RRB- per animal in compensation , but an independent newspaper reported on Thursday no compensation would be paid .

2009-04-30,"CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 10:18 pm EDT CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. space agency NASA plans to eliminate 900 manufacturing jobs over the next five months as it prepares to retire its space shuttle fleet in 2010 , NASA officials said on Thursday . 
The first 160 layoff notices go out on Friday , primarily to contractors producing the space shuttle fuel tanks outside New Orleans and the shuttle solid rocket boosters in Utah . 
The prime contractors for those components are Lockheed Martin Corp and ATK Thiokol . 
`` This is the first significant loss of manufacturing capability , '' shuttle program manager John Shannon told reporters . 
The three-ship shuttle fleet is due to be retired after eight more flights to finish building and equipping the International Space Station and a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope . 
Managers on Thursday settled on a May 11 launch date for shuttle Atlantis ' 11-day mission to Hubble . 
Liftoff is set for 2:01 p.m. EDT -LRB- 1801 GMT -RRB- from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . 
NASA officials said that they were monitoring the nationwide alert over the new swine flu , or influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- flu virus , but so far the disease was not affecting any of its operations . 
`` We 're not doing anything special at this point , '' said NASA 's associate administrator for space operations Bill Gerstenmaier . 
NASA plans to replace the shuttles with Apollo-style capsules that in addition to traveling to the space station will be able to fly astronauts to the moon 's surface . 
Hoping to keep the new spaceships , named Orion , on track for a 2015 debut , NASA said earlier this week it had decided to produce only one version of the capsule with room for four astronauts , rather than the six-seater version that had been planned for flights to the station . 
Money for developing Orion and its launcher , called Ares , is coming from funds that previously went toward shuttle operations and station construction . 
The shuttle is the only vehicle that can service orbiting satellites , such as the Hubble telescope , as well as handle massive construction efforts , like assembly of the space station . 
NASA has made four previous servicing calls to Hubble to repair equipment and install new science instruments . 
The observatory , which was launched in 1990 , has been instrumental in reshaping scientists ' understanding of the universe and expanding public knowledge of astronomy . 
Its observations have been used by astronomers to determine that space is expanding at an increasingly faster rate , that massive black holes live in the hearts of most galaxies and that new planets likely are born in flat disks of gas and dust that circle stars . 
The final visit to Hubble features five spacewalks to install a new camera , resuscitate two failed instruments and other work . 
NASA hopes the mission will leave Hubble in good enough shape to continue working until at least 2014 when an more sensitive replacement telescope is put into orbit .

Several countries have banned pork imports although the World Health Organisation has said swine flu is not spread by eating pork . 
`` There is no decision to ban pork meat products , '' said Majid al-Mansouri , secretary-general of the Environment Agency and member of a higher committee responsible for combating the flu . 
The market for pig meat in the UAE is small , since it is a Muslim country where restrictions on the sale of pork products already apply . 
Official figures were not available but two local food traders estimated the value of such imports to the UAE in 2008 at around $ 11 million . 
The UAE does not import live pigs . 
Although there was no official federal ban , some supermarkets and local authorities had begun to take precautions . 
Earlier on Thursday , a spokesperson for the Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority said there was a ban on `` all imports of pork products as a precautionary measure to protect consumers '' . 
Supermarkets in Abu Dhabi said they had stopped selling pork and those in Dubai did not expect to receive fresh supplies . 
`` We are not selling any pork products in Abu Dhabi , '' said Omar Khan , Spinneys supermarket store manager in the capital . 
Gulf states are preparing to hold an emergency meeting in the next few days to coordinate efforts to combat swine flu , which has caused jitters on Gulf Arab stock markets . 
The new H1N1 strain first emerged in Mexico and has killed up to 176 people there , according to Mexican authorities . 
So far , no Gulf country has reported any cases of the flu . 
The UAE is the Middle East 's main air travel hub but the country 's health ministry said this week there were no restrictions on travel as yet . 
The Gulf Cooperation Council includes Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Kuwait , the UAE , Bahrain and Oman . 
Israel on Tuesday confirmed one case of swine flu , the closest the virus has come to the Arabian Peninsula .

2009-04-30,"WASHINGTON | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 4:32 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. officials said on Thursday the national total of confirmed H1N1 swine flu cases had risen to 109 , but that the country had still only recorded one fatality in the outbreak . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that New York was lead the case tally with 50 , while Texas reported 26 and California 14 . 
South Carolina had confirmed 10 new cases , it said . 
The CDC said on Wednesday that a 22-month old Mexican boy who died of swine flu in Texas was the only U.S. fatality so far , the only person outside of Mexico to die in the outbreak .

2009-04-30,"\* New tests will go to state health departments \* New lab will help Mexico test more quickly By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON , April 30 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - New tests are being shipped to U.S. states that should speed up efforts to screen for the new flu virus that threatens to start a pandemic , health officials said on Thursday . 
And a lab with the new test has been set up in Mexico in the hope of finding out how many of the 2,500 suspected cases are in fact the new strain of H1N1 swine flu . 
`` Now there is a lab that is up and running in Mexico that is able to do diagnoses , '' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acting director Dr. Richard Besser told reporters . 
Before , Mexico had to send samples to the CDC in Atlanta or a World Health Organization lab in Winnipeg , Canada , meaning a lag of several days . 
`` This is really a big step . 
It is going to help us with the studies there . 
We will be able to confirm cases , the risk factors for those cases . 
It is going to be very helpful in terms of speeding up the course of those studies . '' 
Besser said the CDC is sending out testing kits to U.S. states that will allow individual state labs to confirm their own cases of swine flu . 
`` We are in the process of rolling out testing capability in every state , '' Besser said . 
The new strain , a strange mix of two swine flu strains with dribblings of genetic material from avian and human flu virus , may have killed up to 176 people in Mexico and a toddler in Texas . 
But the symptoms it causes are virtually identical to regular seasonal flu , as well as a host of other respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more exotic coronaviruses . 
A quick on-the-spot test can tell doctors if a patient has influenza and some will tell whether it is type A. But more sophisticated tests must be done to show whether it is an H1N1 , the type that includes both one of the seasonal influenza strains and the new swine flu strain . 
Even further testing will show if it is the new strain , but this requires either a process called PCR , which amplifies and analyzes the genetic material of the virus , or using a test called an antibody test to see if the patient 's immune system has mounted a defense against the virus . 
`` What is being rolled out right now by the CDC is a specific test for this new virus , '' said the CDC 's Dr. Lyle Petersen . 
It will fit onto the PCR platform used in state health departments for influenza surveillance and will produce a result in a matter of hours , Petersen said . 
But it is not something a doctor or clinic can do . 
`` You need a fancy machine to do it , '' he said in a telephone interview . 
For now , the CDC recommends only that people with flulike symptoms who have some kind of recent travel to Mexico or who have been in close contact with a known swine flu patient should get the test . 
Petersen said there is a limited amount of material , called reagent , that can be used to make the PCR tests work . 
And if the disease is spreading , that will become clear anyhow . 
`` No one is going to recommend doing wholesale testing anyway . 
If you have a giant outbreak of flu you do n't need to test every single person if you know what it is , '' he said .

2009-04-30,"LONDON | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 2:27 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Dead pigs in China , evil factory farms in Mexico and an Al Qaeda plot involving Mexican drug cartels are a few wild theories seeking to explain a deadly swine flu outbreak that has killed up to 176 people . 
Nobody knows for sure but scientists say the origins are in fact far less sinister and are likely explained by the ability of viruses to mutate and jump from species to species as animals and people increasingly live closer to each other . 
`` The pig has been considered the mixing bowl of influenza viruses . 
Both avian flu and pig flu viruses have spread via the pig to humans , '' Paul Yeo , a virologist at Durham University in Britain , said on Thursday . 
`` The problem now with this virus is that it has picked up a mixture of elements , now including human elements . 
It 's a complex virus . '' 
Twelve countries have confirmed cases of the H1N1 strain , a new infection that has brought the world to the brink of a pandemic . 
Finding the source of a new virus is key for scientists because understanding how it jumped to humans can lead to better drugs and vaccines as well as help prevent future outbreaks . 
But one link experts probably wo n't be exploring is an Internet report charging that Mexican drug cartels working with al Qaeda unleashed the swine flu . 
`` The claim of the conspiracy theorists is that this new combination could not have occurred naturally , but this is not true , '' the New Scientist 's biology editor Michael Le Page wrote . 
`` Flu viruses consisting of a mixture of human , swine and bird strains have been found before . '' 
Sound science , however , is no match for the Internet and unsubstantiated media reports when it comes to providing a forum for ideas that have forced responses from governments and companies alike . 
China 's Ministry of Agriculture , for example , on Wednesday denied overseas reports charging that dead pigs found in a south eastern province might be to blame for swine flu , according to an official Xinhua news agency article . 
And in Mexico reports in at least two newspapers focused on a factory farm run by a subsidiary of global food giant Smithfield Foods . 
Some of the rumors mentioned noxious fumes from pig manure and flies -- neither a known vector for flu viruses . 
Those reports brought a swift reply from the biggest U.S. hog producer . 
`` Based on available recent information , Smithfield has no reason to believe that the virus is in any way connected to its operations in Mexico , '' the company said in a statement . 
Viruses spread much more easily on factory farms where animals are packed together than in the wild but so far there is no evidence that any one particular farm is the source .

2009-04-30,"Mexican transit policewoman wears a surgical face mask in Mexico City April 27 , 2009 . 
GENEVA | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 11:39 am EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Swine flu will carry the name `` pandemic '' even if the new virus turns out to cause mainly mild symptoms as it sweeps the world , raising questions about how serious the global alert actually is . 
Although it has been deadly in the disease epicenter , Mexico , and caused the death of one Mexican infant in the United States , in other countries people infected with swine flu have fared well , with diarrhea the biggest complaint . 
The World Health Organization is expected to move quickly to designate a full pandemic -- at level 6 of its 6-point scale -- within days to reflect the continuing spread of swine flu among people who have not been to Mexico , including in Europe . 
Margaret Chan , the WHO 's director-general , on Wednesday night raised the world flu alert level from 4 to 5 and said : `` It is really all of humanity that is under threat during a pandemic . '' 
Echoing other infectious disease experts , and drawing on her experience fighting SARS and bird flu outbreaks as health director of Hong Kong , she said viruses such as the H1N1 swine strain needed to be closely watched in case they worsen . 
`` We learn from previous pandemics . 
Pandemic virus is precarious , unpredictable , and will take us by surprise , '' she told reporters at the WHO 's headquarters . 
But Chan acknowledged that the disease may well cause more discomfort than death , noting that many patients infected in the United States have recovered on their own and without medicine . 
`` It is possible that the full clinical spectrum of this disease goes from mild illness to severe disease . 
We need to continue to monitor the evolution of the situation to get the specific information and data we need to answer this , '' she said . 
`` There may be a possibility that the virus will die out and stop , and that would be the best for us . 
But it can turn the other way . '' 
Several theories are circulating about why swine flu has killed as many as 176 people in Mexico while having mild and more manageable effects elsewhere . 
Some experts speculate that the Mexican victims did not receive appropriate medical care or suffered other health complications that made them vulnerable to the flu . 
For the time being , the WHO 's own guidance to people who suspect they have been infected with swine flu is essentially the same as advice for seasonal flu care . 
Its website 's `` frequently asked questions '' about the virus tell people who have a high fever , cough or sore throat to rest and take plenty of fluids , wash hands frequently , and avoid work , school or crowds as much as possible . 
-LRB- www.who.int\/csr\/disease\/swineflu\/faq\/en\/index.html #q 11 -RRB- Keiji Fukuda , the WHO 's acting assistant director-general , said that swine flu appeared very similar to normal seasonal flu , a disease that is rarely fatal for healthy adults but can kill the elderly and infirm . 
Between 3 and 5 million people experience severe illness due to regular , seasonal flu around the world each year , and between 250,000 and 500,000 die as a result . 
Fukuda said it was not yet clear whether swine flu would turn into a mild or severe pandemic , raising the possibility that the virus could have more serious effects as it continues to permeate new communities or as climate conditions change . 
There were three pandemic flu outbreaks in the 20th century -- in 1918 , 1957 and 1968 -- known respectively as Spanish , Asian , and Hong Kong influenza . 
An estimated 50 million people died in the first outbreak , about 2 million in the second and between 1 and 3 million in the third . 
`` In the 1918 pandemic , the first wave was mild , but by fall , the second wave killed many people . 
So whichever way this virus swings , we ca n't possibly know , '' said Guan Yi , a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong . 
`` At this point , chances are it will be mild , but we ca n't rule out it will turn virulent . 
And even if it turns milder , it can still kill , depending on the kind of person it infects . '' 
Health experts fear swine flu could be especially dangerous for the old and infirm , especially those with immune-system suppressing diseases such as HIV\/AIDS . 
Its spread to poor countries that lack medical staff , drug stockpiles , and diagnostic tests -- and where tropical and other diseases are also prevalent -- is another serious concern . 
Guan Yi said that if it spread to Egypt or Indonesia , where H5N1 bird flu is endemic , it might combine with that virus . 
`` It could turn into a very powerful H5N1 that is very transmissible among people . 
Then we will be in trouble , it will be a tragedy . ''

2009-05-01,"EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou : `` There is no need to panic '' EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou has said a possible swine flu global epidemic , or pandemic , would not necessarily cause widespread deaths . 
She said Europe was well prepared and there was `` no need to panic '' . 
She was speaking after an emergency meeting of health ministers on ways to contain the virus , which has been confirmed in six EU countries . 
The ministers rejected a French proposal for a continent-wide suspension on flights to Mexico . 
After the talks in Luxembourg Ms Vassiliou said : `` We are worried , but we are on top of things . '' 
US : one death , at least 109 confirmed cases New Zealand : 3 confirmed , 13 probable cases The Netherland , Switzerland , Austria : 1 confirmed case each Peru case now ` unconfirmed ' by national government She added : `` The fact that we have been preparing ourselves in the EU for an event such as this for some years now , and the experience gained so far , puts us in a much stronger position . '' 
None of the dozens of cases of swine flu reported on the continent so far has been severe . 
The health ministers agreed to work `` without delay '' with pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine . 
Rejecting the French plan on suspending flights to Mexico - the main focus of the outbreak - they said it was up to member states to set their own policies . 
Several countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have canceled holidays . 
Earlier the UN 's World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- - which increased its pandemic alert to five on Wednesday - said it had no immediate plans for a further rise . 
`` We do not have any evidence to suggest that we should move to phase six today , or any such move is imminent right now , '' said WHO Assistant Director General Keiji Fukuda . 
The White House said a security aide who had helped arrange President Barack Obama 's recent trip to Mexico has become sick with flu-like symptoms The Netherlands confirms its first case of swine flu , in a three-year-old boy recently returned from Mexico . 
Cases have also been confirmed in Switzerland and Costa Rica The number of confirmed cases in the US rose to 109 in 11 states Japan reported its first suspected case of swine flu Health Minister Oscar Ugarte said tests on Peru 's sole suspected case had proved negative , reversing an earlier statement SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection In Mexico , the number of confirmed cases rose to 260 - up from 26 on Wednesday , something experts attributed to many laboratory results coming in . 
The Mexican government increased the number of confirmed deaths from swine flu from 8 to 12 . 
President Felipe Calderon has urged people to stay at home over the next five days . 
The US has announced that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico . 
Meanwhile the WHO says it will now call the virus influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- rather than swine flu - which it says is misleading as pork meat is safe and the virus is being transmitted from human to human . 
Egypt has begun a mass slaughter of its pigs , and Ghana is the latest country to ban pork imports as a precaution against swine flu .

2009-05-01,"Swine Flu : Your questions answered More cases of swine flu have been confirmed across the globe , while in Mexico the number of suspected deaths linked to the virus is reported to be more than 160 . 
John McConnell is Editor of The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal One person has died in the US and cases have now been confirmed in 12 countries over three continents . 
Mexican officials say the spread of the virus is slowing , but international experts are more cautious . 
The World Health Organization has raised its pandemic alert to five , the second-highest level , but says it has no immediate plans for another rise . 
Here John McConnell , editor of the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal , answers a selection of your questions about the epidemic . 
How can you differentiate swine flu from the common and seasonal flu ? 
Mvula Zakeyo , Lusaka , Zambia How do the symptoms of swine , or `` novel '' flu differ from those of a regular flu , if at all ? 
It would most likely ease widespread panic if people knew what to look for aside of sneezing and nausea . 
Adam Cullen , Tallinn , Estonia Mr McConnell : Unless you have access to a virology laboratory , you probably ca n't distinguish the two . 
Symptoms of swine and seasonal flu include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , headache , chills , and fatigue . 
Patients do seem to be reporting diarrhoea and vomiting more often with swine flu than is the case for `` normal '' flu , but in practice the two forms are probably indistinguishable . 
I was surprised to be told that wearing masks can actually increase the risk of getting the infection rather than not wearing one at all . 
The area around your mouth and nose becomes very warm and moist , which is a perfect breeding ground for the virus and that wearing a mask does not reduce the risk at all because it can filter through the holes . 
Samantha , Redditch Mr McConnell : The virus breeds in tissues of the respiratory tract , not on the skin however warm and damp it may get . 
Surgical masks , as seem to be handed out in Mexico , are designed to prevent transmission of disease rather than prevent its acquisition . 
Masks will certainly become less effective as they become damp and more porous , so masks would have to be changed several times per day to be of any value . 
The UK government has not stockpiled masks as part of its pandemic preparedness plan , although there have been reports of the government now ordering supplies of masks . 
The Spanish Pandemic killed mainly due to cytokine storms which I understand to be the immune system overreacting . 
Is the swine flu similar ? 
If so , would drugs to lower the immune system in young adults with the virus help lower mortality rate ? 
Trebor Evans , Llandudno , North Wales Mr McConnell : There is no evidence as yet that the Mexican swine flu virus causes the so-called cytokine storm . 
I would be very wary about doing anything to dampen the immune response of someone ill with flu . 
There is so much publicity on the swine flu . 
How do we know that the flu has become pandemic at a more local level ? 
What precautions should the general public who do not travel to any infected region take to minimize the risk of infection ? 
Does a rise the temperature contribute to the spread of the virus ? 
Rozie A R , Sg Buloh , Selangor , Malaysia Mr McConnell : We will know the virus is causing local epidemics when there is a continuous chain of transmission from one person to the next within a country . 
There is no guaranteed way to avoid infection while carrying on the activities of daily life . 
Employers should instruct staff who do not feel well to not come to work . 
People who feel ill should stay at home and call their healthcare provider for advice rather than trying to visit the clinic . 
The flu virus seems to prefer cooler winter temperatures , for reasons we do n't understand , hence the annual winter flu seasons . 
I am on immune suppressant medication for rheumatoid arthritis . 
What implications does this have if I come into contact with swine flu ? 
Susan Seal , Birmingham Mr McConnell : You may be more liable to become infected by the virus if you come into contact with it , and the infection may cause more severe illness . 
You should consult your GP for advice on this question . 
Is the virus strain in Mexico stronger than that in the US and elsewhere ? 
Does it have to do with the treatment , immunity , or something else ? 
Eneida Rista , Tirana , Albania Mr McConnell : I wish we knew . 
The virus does not seem to differ inside and outside Mexico . 
Access to healthcare may be poorer in Mexico , hence the apparently high mortality rate , but we do n't have enough data on illness and death among confirmed cases to even say whether the apparent high mortality rate is `` real '' . 
I understand that Mexico City has a population of almost 9 million . 
Assuming a large proportion of the population has been exposed to the virus is n't 150 deaths rather a small figure , probably surpassed by what we would normally expect as a seasonal outbreak ? 
John Williams , Bromley Mr McConnell : Similar to the answer to Eneida Rista 's question above , we do n't yet have sufficient data to determine whether the mortality rate is exceptional . 
What is clear is that the Mexican swine flu virus is a variant of the H1N1 virus new to human beings , is not the same as the seasonal flu viruses that have been circulating this year , and is causing illness and death among human beings . 
Why are drugs companies permitted to recommend that workers with seasonal flu take a flu remedy and continue at work when infectious and yet we have a panic over swine flu with isolation ? 
Could the Health Protection Agency work with drugs companies and employers to remind individuals that seasonal flu is contagious , serious and that if you do have flu you must stay at home to minimize risk of transmission ? 
Maybe I 'm a cynic but is this not all hyped up to take our collective eyes off the deepening economic situation ? 
Jean Howard , Street , Somerset Mr McConnell : I think the point you are getting at is that drugs against flu are marketed on the basis that they reduce the duration of illness and thus allow earlier return to work . 
The reason that the NHS does not prescribe Tamiflu and Relenza routinely is that the drugs are expensive and flu is for most otherwise healthy people a self-limiting illness from which they will recover within a week or so . 
I agree that people who are ill with flu should stay at home and not risk spreading it to work mates or traveling companions . 
Indeed , if you have flu you will know about it and not want to get out of bed for a couple of days . 
Anyone who tells you they 've had `` a touch of flu '' has had a cold - flu is far more debilitating than a cold . 
A flu pandemic will likely deepen the economic recession , so it 's not the diversionary tactic I would have chosen were I in government ! 
I do n't understand why this is so important . 
Only nine people out of hundreds of millions have died from this . 
Do n't more die everyday from regular flu ? 
Are n't there other more serious illnesses that are killing people ? 
Hope Lomas , Chagrin Falls Ohio USA Mr McConnell : Around the world , every day thousands of people are dying of AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria . 
AIDS is treatable , tuberculosis and malaria are curable . 
Diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases , which are almost certainly infectious in origin , kill millions of children under the age of five every year . 
Even in the fat , wealthy developed world , infectious diseases such as pneumonia -LRB- particularly among the elderly -RRB- and sepsis -LRB- particularly among those with underlying medical conditions -RRB- kill hundreds of thousands of people every year . 
Indeed , overall , infectious diseases cause 15-20 million deaths every year - the cause of about one third of all deaths . 
Swine flu is notable because it 's an exceptional event , something above the everyday toll of deaths caused by infectious diseases . 
A pandemic similar to that of 1918-19 , which killed at least 50 million people , would be a catastrophic event because it would double annual worldwide mortality . 
However , I think the chances of a repeat of 1918-19 are very small . 
What swine flu , and the media reaction to it , does highlight is our willingness to accept the `` routine '' toll of infectious diseases with little apparent concern . 
However , `` Mother dies of TB in Zambia and infects her three children '' is not a headline that sells many papers . 
Mr McConnell : A short and sweet answer : Yes . 
"
2009-05-01,"Influenza viruses are able to swap genetic material Preliminary analysis of the swine flu virus suggests it is a fairly mild strain , scientists say . 
It is believed that a further mutation would be needed in order for the H1N1 virus to cause the mass deaths that have been estimated by some . 
But at this point , it is impossible to predict with any accuracy how the virus will continue to evolve . 
UK experts at the National Institute for Medical Research outlined on Friday the work they are due to start on samples of the virus sent from the US . 
The research , being done at the World Influenza Centre in Mill Hill , will be vital for working out the structure of the virus , where it came from , how quickly it is capable of spreading and its potential to cause illness . 
Analysis done so far suggests what they are dealing with is a mild virus and nowhere near as dangerous as the H5N1 avian flu strain that has caused scientists so much concern over the past decade . 
Influenza A viruses are classified according to two proteins on the outer surface of the virus - hemagglutinin -LRB- H -RRB- and neuraminidase -LRB- N -RRB- . 
Less severe symptoms , but can be deadly Spreads easily between birds but human transmission rare The swine flu strain is a H1N1 virus , the same type as seasonal flu which circulates throughout the world every year , and kills roughly 0.1 % of those infected or higher in an epidemic year . 
Professor Wendy Barclay , chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London says initial indications suggest there is nothing about the genetic make-up of the new virus which is a cause for particular concern . 
The key to its potential lies largely in the H1 protein . 
`` There are two aspects - one is which receptors the virus tends to bind to and what we see is that it is binding to the upper respiratory tract rather than deep in the lungs . '' 
Attaches to receptors in the upper respiratory tract causing mild illness A pandemic is thought to be imminent When a flu virus binds to the upper respiratory tract , it tends to cause mild illness but can be easily spread as people cough and sneeze , Professor Barclay explains . 
If a virus binds further down in the lungs , it tends to cause much more severe illness , as in the case of the H5N1 avian flu virus which has caused concern in recent years . 
`` With the H1 gene we also look at the cleavage site , '' she adds . 
`` The virus has to be cut into two pieces to be active and it uses an enzyme in the host to do that . 
`` Most influenza viruses are restricted to the respiratory tract because they use enzymes in the lungs . 
`` But some , like H5 viruses can evolve to cut into two pieces outside the lungs , so they can replicate outside the respiratory tract . '' 
These initial indications are largely guesswork from looking at the genetic sequence of the virus and comparing that to what is known from work on other influenza viruses . 
It will take weeks and months of biological analysis to properly get a handle on the potential of the H1N1 virus . 
The team at Mill Hill , one of four World Health Organisation 's centres for influenza research will be working in close collaboration with the Health Protection Agency who are carrying out testing in the UK , and their findings will also feed into the development of a potential vaccine . 
What this outbreak does highlight is how difficult it is to predict new pandemic strains Professor Jonathan Ball , Nottingham University Soon , the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge will begin the genetic sequencing of the virus and will also be monitoring any mutations or changes in how virulent it is . 
However , there is one other reassuring aspect about what is known so far . 
That is there seems to be nothing unusual as yet in another protein in the center of the virus , called NS1 , which is linked to the strength of the immune response the virus produces . 
In some more pathogenic viruses , it is this NS1 protein which initiates a `` cytokine storm '' , a particularly severe immune reaction that can be fatal in even healthy young people . 
Scientists have also played down concerns that the milder H1N1 virus , could combine with the more dangerous H5N1 avian flu virus , causing a super virus that has the ability to both spread easily between humans and cause severe illness . 
This is unlikely - or at least just as unlikely as it ever was and the H5N1 virus has been around for a decade without combining with normal seasonal flu . 
Professor Jonathan Ball , an expert in molecular virology at the University of Nottingham said : `` The chance of swine H1N1 combining with H5N1 is as likely as any other strain recombining . 
`` What this outbreak does highlight is how difficult it is to predict new pandemic strains . 
`` Many people suspected that H5N1 was the most likely candidate for the next pandemic strain , but now it appears that this was a mistake - but that 's not to say H5N1 or another reassortment containing parts of H5N1 may not happen in the future . 
`` That 's the trouble - you ca n't predict . ''

2009-05-01,"Girl tests positive for swine flu Year seven pupils from a school in South Gloucestershire have been given anti-viral drugs after a confirmed case of swine flu in a 12-year-old girl . 
Some pupils at Downend school have been seen wearing face masks at the school and others have been given Tamiflu as a precautionary measure . 
A letter has been sent to parents with the symptoms and parents to contact their GP if exhibiting symptoms . 
The girl tested positive for virus A H1N1 , also known as swine flu . 
She is being treated at home and her condition is described as `` well '' . 
In a statement South Gloucestershire Council said on the advice of the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- , the school would be closed for a week as a precautionary measure . 
`` The pupil concerned has recently returned from Mexico and her symptoms so far are mild . 
Precautionary steps have been taken to minimize the risk to pupils and staff , whose welfare is paramount . 
`` Antiviral drugs were issued to year seven students this afternoon -LRB- Friday -RRB- to reduce any possible spread of infection . 
The drugs will also be offered to teaching staff and pupils from other year groups who have had contact with the affected pupil . 
`` All involved have also been advised to contact their family doctor if they develop ` flu like symptoms within the next week and to stay at home . 
Expert advice suggests that no-one else in any other groups at the school needs to be treated . ''

The NIBSC is one of a small group of influenza centres around the world which will create a seed vaccine strain which could then be grown in bulk by manufacturers . 
Its scientists need a steady hand to drill a hole in a hen 's egg . 
For that is the first step in the creation of a vaccine against the swine flu virus . 
Scientists at NIBSC , which is part of the Health Protection Agency , say eggs are ideal for growing up flu viruses . 
`` They are like virus production factories , '' its principal scientist Dr John Wood explained . 
Manufacturers are halfway through producing their normal vaccine to combat winter flu . 
If they are asked to stop - there will be shortages of the normal seasonal vaccine `` Eggs have been used for decades to make flu vaccines . 
It 's an old technology but it works very well . '' 
I was allowed into one of the containment labs which will be used to make the vaccine but not where the live virus is being used . 
This is not because of infection but because I might contaminate the vaccine production process . 
It involves scientists painstakingly injecting a small amount of virus into each egg which will then be incubated over the weekend . 
By Monday , they should have enough virus to begin the next stage . 
Two different techniques are being used . 
First , `` reverse genetics '' , where scientists take the H and the N surface proteins from the H1N1 virus and mix them with a laboratory virus known as PR8 . 
This creates a harmless hybrid virus which can be used for the vaccine . 
The second technique involves injecting both the H1N1 and PR8 viruses into eggs and allowing the hybrid strain to be created through a natural re-assortment of their genes . 
The vaccine will work by tricking the immune system into thinking it has been infected with the H1N1 swine flu virus so that it creates antibodies against it . 
Then , if subsequently exposed to the virus , the immune system will destroy the invader before it can cause illness . 
The first seed strain of H1N1 swine flu vaccine should be ready in three to four weeks . 
It will then take another four or five months for vaccine manufacturers to produce the vaccine in bulk . 
On Wednesday , when the WHO raised the threat level to five - one short of a pandemic , its director general stopped short of asking vaccine manufacturers to switch to an H1N1 strain . 
Dr Margaret Chan said this was because it was not yet clear how severe the virus would be . 
`` It will be an extremely difficult decision for the World Health Organisation and governments to make , '' said Dr Wood . 
`` Manufacturers are halfway through producing their normal vaccine to combat winter flu . 
It could take manufacturers up to five months to mass-produce the vaccine `` If they are asked to stop doing that it means there will be shortages of the normal seasonal vaccine and vulnerable people could be susceptible if there was an epidemic of ordinary flu this winter '' . 
The WHO has a matter of weeks in which to make that decision if it does not want to lose valuable time . 
No-one should expect a swine flu vaccine to be available before the Autumn . 
In fact most of us will have to wait a lot longer . 
Around 300 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine are produced globally each year . 
The vaccine includes three different strains of human flu so each dose takes three eggs to produce . 
If manufacturers switched to producing a single pandemic strain vaccine , they might feasibly triple the number of doses to around 900 million . 
But it may not be that simple . 
We do not know how well the virus will grow in eggs or how much antigen will be needed to create an effective vaccine . 
It may require two injections to provide adequate immunity . 
With a world population of more than six billion , there clearly will not be enough to go round and the disease will hit poorer countries hardest because they can not afford to buy the vaccines . 
The UK government has contracts with two manufacturers to produce 120 million doses of pandemic vaccine - enough for two doses per Briton , if required . 
But unless you are a front-line healthcare worker or someone involved in an essential service , do not be surprised if you are not among the first to receive it . 
If a pandemic is declared and vaccine production begun then most of us are likely to have to wait until well into next year before we are offered it . 
That is why it is so important to try to prevent an epidemic in Britain now . 
That would buy us valuable time in which to create a vaccine .

2009-05-01,"On 1st March we moved to a new blogging system . 
The archives of all the student , teacher and staff blogs are still available here to read but commenting has closed . 
Here is the link to the new system : First of all , I want to thank everyone put his comment on the first entery and I promise I will reply to most of these comments as soon as possible ! 
Unfortunately , my second entery is not that pleasent . 
On the last few days the world was stunned by the news of the outbreak of swine flu epidemic . 
Here in Egypt , people are terrified especially after they learned that this disease is fatal and can be transferred from ahumanbeing to another , and there is a general pessimistic attitude throughout most of Egyptian community . 
As a full-time pharmacist in a community pharmacy , I can tell how people are deepely concerned . 
Many customers , who enter the pharmacy these days , with common cold symptoms ca n't now treat this whole matter simply as the past and some of them do n't hesitate to ask me if they cought swine flu . 
Also , I used to be asked about the availability of `` Tmiflu '' and protective masks . 
Of course I answer these poor patients with a big a smile on my face that there 's nothing to worry about with many of `` Stop it ! '' 
and `` Do n't bother yourself ! '' . 
Frankly speaking , I 'm really ... . 
really worried and afraid to some extent . 
Medically speaking , Most types of influinza , including the swine type , share the same symptoms of the the regular flu and we ca n't reach an exact diagnosis without laboratory test . 
Also , the WHO says that the current anti-influinza vaccines and the widely known antiviral drug `` Tamiflu '' showed little effectiveness against swine flu . 
Added to that , I 'm not sure that using protective musks is adequate to protect ourselves from this virus whish is still classified as the strongest micro organism on earth . 
Absolutely disappointing !!!!!!! Is n't it ? 
But have you realized that some international reactions was to some sort childish and showing a great degree of lack of responsibility and even sense towards an epedimic that threats the all humanbeings ? 
Especially , these animal rights defending organizations who condemned the Egyptian authorities disicion to slaughter all pigs as a preemptive action to avoid a swine flu outbreak in Egypt . 
Very rediulous !!!! So what to do ? 
Just wait and see ! 
The WHO says that a time period of 3 to 6 monthes is needed after the isolation and the identification of the genetic map `` genome '' of the virus to produce an effective vaccine . 
Until that time , we should follow strictly the widely known precautions including washing hands properly , wearing protective masks , which I still do n't believe in its effectiveness , avoid the change of climate and , of course , stop eating pork . 
Next entery , I promise , will be less disappointing ! 
I know that the title may be a little bit strange , but it was just to tell you that I call your name withot the proper way `` Mrs Rachel '' to avoid violation of the friendly image of the blog . 
I hope that it wo n't be percieved as a humulation or a disrespect to you . 
Anyhow , I want to ask you to stress in your next enteries on the proper use of punctuation marks . 
Besides , I will wait impatiently for your tips and remarks on my way of writing to enhance my writing skills and make my essays more understandable and acceptable . 
On the other hand , I consider speaking is the most troublemaking skills for me . 
Due to the nature of my proffission as a pharmacist and the location of the pharmacy I have to speak English , in many cases , to native speakers . 
You ca n't imagine how terrible I become when I have to speak , my face flushes and I sweat heavily and my body temperature spikes suddenly , and how many naieve mistakes Imake . 
For example , a British woman came to the pharmacy to buy her medicine and after I gave it to her I asked her , when I realized her accent , `` Mam , you seems to be British '' She smiled and saied , '' Yes '' I think you now noticed how bad I need to fix this ability of fluent speaking . 
Comments on many comments : -RRB- Oh my God ! 
I do n't believe that the first week passed so quickly like that ! 
Anyway , this is the proper time to reply to some of your wonderful comments I was impressed and surprised that my introductory entery recieved 20 comments . 
That was a very warm welcomming attitude I have never expected ! 
On the other side , I have to tell you that my enteries focus intensively on parts of everyday life in Egypt which , as I think , you will not read about in tourism booklets and , maybe , you ca n't have the chance to learn about when you visit Egypt as tourists . 
I hope this will not disappoint you . 
Cheik Vall from Mauritania and Soroush from Toronto : The advice about avoiding eatin pork was said by many well known physicians and specialists in Egypt . 
I know that this disease is airbourne , but I think that this virus has the strength and the fatality of bird flu -LRB- H5N1 -RRB- and the ability to transfer from a human to another of the human flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . 
This makes the way of the disease transfer unpredictable . 
This is , of course , regardless to the other health hazards of eating pork and the fact that Islam bans eating pork which needs no notice . 
Here in Egypt we have alot of well-equipped labs that can analyze thousands of samples within short time . 
I think that the real problem is not the availablity of equipments . 
It 's all about how to control the outbreak of the swine flu if happened . 
This is the chief concern of everyone in the globe . 
Cristina from Buenos Aires , Argentina : I ca n't agree more with most of what you said except about eating pork and the role of pigs in this dilemma . 
3-To Rachel , with all respect : -RRB- Also the huge number of comments was absolutely impressive . 
I ca n't tell you how grateful I am . 
Thanks alot for your supportive comments and useful advices . 
4 - Dusting dusty dustingly dust !!!!!!! You are 100 % right . 
Spring is not supposed to be that bad , but this is the bitter truth in Egypt . 
Actually , autumn is the best season in the year in Egypt . 
Unfortunately , it 's the beginning of schools activities , so , I can rarely enjoy the fine weather of this season , Cristina from Buenos Aires , Argentina : Well , the sales was n't that good in this day . 
It was another slow day . 
Anyway , every thing emproved after that . 
Actually , I am afraid of that too !!!!!! But I can do nothing !!!! Wish me a good luck , brother !!!! It 's nice to know that Egypt is not alone in suffering . 
Thanks Hyoshi Thanks again for your sweet comments and I apologize for those whom I did n't reply to their comments . 
once upon atime in a line ! 
How long have you standed in a line inside or outside a bilding to do any thing ? 
And what was the longst duratione you have done that ever ? 
Well , letme break your personal records !!!!! So , ladies and gentelmen ! 
Now we will celebrate the new world record !!!!! SIX HOURS !!!!!! HURRAY !!!!!!!!!!!!! Ladies and Gentelmen , let 's applause to our Herooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!!!!! Seriously , Egyptians , especially in Cairo , are used to this kind of tidious activity . 
This is supposed to be natural especially if we are talking a bout a big city with more than 20 million residents . 
An Egyptian journalist described that as '' The worst and most brutal punishmint for your sins ! '' 
Three weeks ago , I had to go to the National Records authority to issue a new copy of this : Egyptian identity card : image removed by BBC Learning English This is the `` The national ID card '' which is the most important document in an ordinary Egyptian life . 
In fact , you ca n't make a passport , enroll in courses or buy a car without it , and in many cases your identity is denied if you missed yours ! 
Actually , I had to change some details in my ID in order to issuing other important documents . 
And that was the very begining of the story . 
10.00 am : I reached the national records building . 
I supposed it was early ... . . 
What a stupid thought ! 
Unfortunately , I found an extremely long line of people extended from the basement to the first floor , department of national IDs . 
So , I have to take my position in that line . 
Some people told me that they were here from 7.00 am till this moment !!!!!!!! 11.00 am : The line moved slowly and I put my exhausted feet on the stairs towards my destination . 
12.00 am : The electrecity cut off suddenly ! 
This meant , with no doubt , many other precious minuets would be wasted just like that ! 
1.00 pm : The electricity was back ... . . 
The line resumed moving with the same slow speed after meaningless stop . 
3.00 pm : Finally , I reached the clerk responsible for finishing my papers . 
But that was n't the end of the suffering . 
She , by the way she was a woman , showed me an ugly smile and said , `` This is the end of my shift ! 
... ... ... . . 
Please , do n't lough !!!!! 4.00 pm : After another hour of waiting that left me and rest of the people very furious , the other clerk arrived . 
Me and the people behind me were so exhausted and tired , my blood pressure dropped and I was near to faint , to blame that man or yell on him . 
He finished my paper and this drama , that seemed to be endless , reached its end ! 
Finding a bus that drove me home was n't that difficult and I layed down on my bed on 5.45 pm !!!!!! Thanks alot for your last enteries , especially the last one . 
They were absolutely useful . 
I 've read the leaflet and , as you , found it strange to read an expression like '' flu friend ' . 
But actually , the statement '' Catch it , Bin it , Kill it '' is my favorite . 
This reminds me with a widely used term in medical books '' Typhoid Marry '' . 
Marry was a cook used to process meals to many high class families in USA in the third decade of 20th century . 
Many children and even elderly members of these families died with typhoid that was a fatal bacterial disease at this time . 
Physicians found typhoid in the samples of food prepared by Marry and , later on , in her blood smear . 
She had typhoid in her blood but did n't harm her . 
Nowadays , This term is used to define people like Marry who can spread a dangerous disease , viral or bacterial , unitentionally . 
In another words , they are called `` carriers '' You are right about new situations that give birth to new words . 
This is also true about Arabic . 
Anyway , languages are described to be adaptable , I spent more than ten minuets to remember this word . 
On the other hand , new situations can give '' life kiss '' to some words that was thought to be burried forever in language books . 
For example , many English language students , like me , had to deal with words like `` terrorism '' , `` tolerance '' , `` mass destruction weapons '' , `` pre-amptive '' , ... . 
etc after 9\/11 attacks . 
During the swine flu crisis , many people I meet and many TV programs presenters used the word H1N1 in stead of swine flu . 
I thaught that this word would still forever used only by medical specialists . 
I was , as usual , wrong . 
That 's it for now . 
See you soon , Rachel . 
Oh yes , I caught flu and I am very sick . 
Actually , I did n't figure out the cause , but I realize that I have to move temporarily from being a flu friend to a flu victim or even a flu prey . 
I am just fine right now and it seems like I will pass this anyway . 
In one of your enteries you said , `` Could you take some photos of yourself at work ? 
I am interested to see what your pharmacy looks like ! '' 
Well , Rachel , I ca n't refuse any thing you ask . 
I took some photos of the most important moments in my work day . 
So , let 's begin . 
10.00 am : I open the pharmacy doors myself Now , it 's time to clean up all this mess of the previous busy night . 
I have never been good in cleening my room and making it tidy , and it was hard at first to do that in pharmacy . 
By time , the whole task has become easier . 
I used to sweep this floor then clean it using a mop every day ... ... Not bad for a young man , is n't it ? 
It 's the time to have my morning tea break . 
I drink one cup of tea with milk two times daily . 
After a while , my mother comes to the pharmacy . 
She is the manager . 
She is a kind woman , but when it comes to work she becomes serious . 
I learned from her many things about managing the pharmacy and how to make my pharmaceutical information very useful . 
She is a good pharmacist and a great manager . 
During this , I have to deal with the new drugs coming to the pharmacy . 
I arrange them in categories , write down their expirey date in the records , put the price lables then puting them in shelves . 
At 3.00 pm my morning shift ends . 
I leave y mother in the pharmacy and stay at home for three hours . 
At 6.00 pm the night shift begins . 
During this shift nothing important happens . 
I spend some moments watching TV . 
I spend most of the night shift with my father . 
He was a surgeon , but he had to retire early when he was 29 because of Parkinsonism , a central nervous system disease . 
In spite of that , he takes part in the management of the pharmacy with my mother and plays successfuly his rule as the leader of the family . 
Also , he gives medical advice to people gratis . 
In fact , he is a brave man . 
I hope you have enjoyed these pictures and looking forward for your comments . 
See you after the weekend . 
When the technology lets you down !!!!! Nowadays , we are sorrunded by many forms of advanced technology . 
Many of us have computers , hold a mobile phone or a pocket pc in the trousers pockets , keep flash memory in hand bags , take photos with digital cameras , ... ... etc. . 
These fancy devices are supposed to make our life easier and that makes us depend on modern technology all the time . 
But what if I tell you that some of these gadgets can let you down and ruin your life ? 
Ther is an old proverb in English , `` The friend in need is the friend in deed '' . 
Well , what my computer and mobile , for example , do is very opposite to a friend action . 
When I was student I used to deal with the computer breaking down suddenly and in critical times . 
I had to spend long nights trying to figure out many problems happened without a just reason during finishing urgent works . 
Last month , my younger sister , by the way I have also a brother , was writing her college assignment . 
She spent 2 days to gather information and 5 long hours typing the report using the Microsoft Word . 
Unfortunately , and before writing the last page , a strange error message appeared and the computer shut down without any warning . 
Yes , the work of 5 hours vanished just like that . 
What do you expect my sister to do ?!!!! Of course she bursted in tears and had to rewrite the report with the tears on her cheaks because the report had to be handed the next day . . 
Yesterday , also , I had to contact the internet service provider to fix a technical problem that cut the internet connection for three days . 
Besides , I ca n't count the number of times my mobile phone turned off during an important call . 
Sometimes , I feel that what happened and happens is , somehow , intentional and these devices do these crimes against me with cold blood because they know that I ca n't afford discarding them right now . 
I know that some of you think that this is a stupid illusions , but I wish that I can treat these idiots like humans and give them a piece of my mind !!!!! From flu victim to flu friend ! 
Roger !!!!! : -RRB- Thanks Rachel for your post . 
I am very glad that you like the photos and I hope I could make you any favor you want . 
By the way , I liked the humming sound you made in the back ground of your fantastic video . 
Do n't be ashamed from something like that . 
It 's a sighn of you that makes your videos unique . 
Finally , thanks alot for your advices about collocations , but could you , please , give me the model answers of your challenge because it 's hard to find the right answers for these mind binding puzzels !!!!!!!!! For the rest of you , thanks alot for your comments and I hope you have liked the photos . 
Happy birthday to you . 
The video is fascinating and I watched it many times . 
It made my day . 
Actually , you are very lucky to have birthday presents and a breakfast on bed . 
Unfortunately , all what I got on my birthday is a cup of black Mocca coffee to help me jump out of my bed and start a new day of busy work . 
Nowadays , my mother is too busy to make a delicious birthday cake as she used to do many years before . 
Life is unfair , is n't it ?!!!! Do n't be sad . 
My father bought me a new trousers which I can consider it as a good compensation . 
Now , Rachel , I will give you a virtual birthday present . 
I realized that you have to go to work every day and I do n't you know if you have a weekly dayoff or , as me , not . 
I want to take with you a `` virtual '' picnic in one of the most significant places in Cairo , just to change the rhythm of life and avoid being another Jack . 
It 's only 10 minuits far from the Citadel . 
Well ... ... it 's not differant from parks in UK , but I hope that the images below will convince you to visit this park when you decide to visit Egypt . 
Now , use your emagination and enjoy these wonderful sceneries . 
I am glad you liked the photos but here are a bunch of nice photos of the sunset from the park . 
I am sure they will give peace to your exhausted souls and end any kind of frustration . 
Thanks Rachel for accepting my humble present and I hope I can give you a real one next time . 
My next entery will be the last before saying goodbye ! 
posted on Thursday , 28 May 2009 | comment on this post Ok guys . 
It 's time to say my last words . 
This a very emotional moment and it 's hard to find anything to say . 
For the blog visitors , thanks alot for your wonderful comments . 
Some of them were funny , some were supportive and some held a lot of sympathy , but , on the end of the day , they made the joy and the benefit of the blog . 
I hope that you liked my few enteries and I am sorry that I did not write many stories about myself , my family , and my country I wanted deeply to write about . 
Sincere thanks to the people of BBC learning English who helped me through this great experience by teaching me how to use the blogging area and removing any technical obstacle . 
I know it is just a small part of your work in your fabulous website , but thanks for your care along this month . 
Finally , I ca n't find suitable words to say to you Rachel . 
I am very glad to know somone like you and I am really sad that this is maybe the last chance to write directly to you . 
I will not forget ever your wise advices you gave me and many writing skills you taught me through this short time . 
An arabic saying tells us , '' The person who taught me a letter deserves my respect and true deeds forever '' . 
`` Thank you '' is not enough for you ! 
I hope I can meet you again through the internet , visit you in the UK , or see you in Egypt to show you hw grateful I am . 
Now , I have to go back to the commenting area and say good luck to our next blogger . 
Here is my very warm or even hot wishes from Egypt , it 's 32 celsius degrees in Cairo today , to you , Taru , in Finland . 
I hope they are warm enough to melt the ice in your country and make you feel warm and able to write . 
Time has come to say thank you Mohammed Jihad for a fantastic blog and some really breathtaking pictures ! 
From Monday please welcome our new blog hostess . 
She is Taru and she is from Finland .

2009-05-01,"Dr Baker is Honorary Secretary of Council to the RCGP Governments around the world are striving to contain a new flu virus suspected of killing more than 100 people in Mexico . 
Experts warn swine flu could spark a global pandemic . 
BBC News online put a number of your questions to flu expert Maureen Baker , Head of Pandemic Planning at the Royal College of General Practitioners . 
Is there a proper definition of how severe a disease is before it can be classed as a pandemic ? 
Chris Bonnello , Birmingham Dr Baker : I believe a pandemic is a disease that spreads round the world . 
In the context of flu , this is when a new strain of influenza virus emerges to which people have no previous resistance , meaning it easily spreads from person to person and from country to country . 
I 'm pregnant and wondered if pregnant ladies will get preference for any vaccination ? 
Sarah Murray , Northamptonshire Dr Baker : If a vaccination for swine flu becomes available , this will not happen for several months . 
As and when that happens , we expect that guidelines will be issued regarding which groups of people should be higher priority for vaccination . 
I have a six-month old baby and we are due to visit a friend who has just returned from Mexico . 
Would you advise staying clear of those individuals who have had recent travel to affected areas ? 
Sarah Jones , London Dr Baker : It is difficult to give specific advice as it probably depends how long ago this friend was in Mexico and whether your friend feels well . 
You should probably weigh these things up and then decide whether to meet your friend just now or not . 
Is swine flu going to be the same as bird flu , i.e. a moral panic , or should we actually be concerned ? 
Chris Berry , Wirral Dr Baker : I believe we should be concerned but not get into a panic . 
Clearly there is significant potential for this outbreak to develop into a pandemic but , as yet , this is not inevitable . 
Any flu is more serious than a cold as a small number of people can develop complications of flu , such as pneumonia . 
The other factor that concerns us in respect of pandemic flu is that large numbers of people can fall ill within a short period of time and this has major implications for health services . 
How long can the virus survive in the air after an infected person has coughed or sneezed ? 
Matthew Sheldon , Derbyshire Dr Baker : Sorry do n't know . 
I expect this information will become available as we learn more about this particular virus strain . 
My husband is nearing the end of a chemotherapy course and we would like to go on a cruise but his immune system is low , will travel be a problem ? 
Marion Vanner , USA Dr Baker : I would suggest you keep a close eye on the developing situation over the next few weeks . 
Your husband should consider consulting his physician for advice nearer your intended travel date . 
Will washing your hands kill the virus on your hands and is an antibacterial soap better ? 
Tim Smith , London Dr Baker : Washing with soap and water is an effective way of cleaning hands . 
Should people who were asthma sufferers as children be worried by this outbreak ? 
Graeme Pearce , Birmingham Dr Baker : So far , we have no information to suggest that people who have a history of asthma are at any higher risk of complications from this strain of flu . 
My friend has recently got back from Mexico and has been feeling ill and now I have developed what seems like a normal cold . 
I have had it for about four days and there is no sign of getting better . 
I have n't been to the doctor . 
What do you advise ? 
Sarah Woollard , Lincolnshire , UK Dr Baker : I think if you have symptoms of a cold - and have had these for four days - then this is almost certainly a normal cold . 
For more detailed advice -LRB- or if your friend wants further information -RRB- it might help to contact NHS Direct . 
What is the incubation time of swine flu from point of exposure ? 
Mrs Catherine Edwards , Cardiff , UK Dr Baker : I do n't believe we know enough yet about this illness to be able to say . 
I would expect this sort of information to become available over the next few days . 
Is the basic flu jab sufficient to protect against this virus ? 
Janice Ward , Banbury , UK Dr Baker : No - so far as we know at present . 
When flu symptoms arise we are told not to bother the doctor , stay at home , keep warm and drink water . 
Good advice usually but in this case , how do you know when it is necessary to contact the doctor ? 
Lesley Buckley , Ely , UK Dr Baker : It is good advice . 
However , people will be able to get more information from NHS Direct . 
If swine flu develops into a pandemic , and reaches the UK , then the public will receive information on leaflets , and from television , that will advise on what to look out for , in terms of worsening symptoms , that should prompt seeking help . 
How does ` flu ' actually ` kill ' someone ? 
How long does it take from becoming infected with virus to death , if that is the outcome ? 
Graham Munn , Stevenage , UK Dr Baker : Flu is an unpleasant illness but one that normally leads to complete recovery within a week or so for most people . 
The danger from flu is mainly from complications , especially pneumonia . 
If people who have flu become much worse , especially if they start to have breathing difficulties , pneumonia should be suspected . 
If pneumonia develops , that probably needs to be treated in hospital with antiviral and\/or antibiotics . 
Some patients with pneumonia can deteriorate very quickly , others may have an illness over a number of days or even weeks . 
The swine flu is from Mexico but how did it come about and is it going to spread in the UK ? 
Sana Mir , Birmingham , UK Dr Baker : Presumably a new strain of flu developed in pigs and then passed to humans -LRB- probably people who work with , or live in close proximity to , pigs -RRB- . 
At present , we do n't know if it will spread to the UK but the authorities are closely monitoring the situation . 
Is there a risk that if the emerging swine flu H1N1 virus comes into contact with the established bird flu H5N1 virus that the two could mix and cause an even bigger pandemic risk ? 
Sarah , Coventry , UK Dr Baker : Any new strain of flu poses a risk of developing into one that can quickly spread and turn into a pandemic . 
Even if these two strains were to meet and lead to evolution of another new virus , I would have thought that would take some time and were it to happen would probably be neither more or less dangerous in itself than any new strain of flu . 
We have booked a holiday to Cancun Mexico in August we have got young children , should we cancel and go elsewhere ? 
Myroulla Christoforou , London , UK Dr Baker : Hopefully by then the outbreak will have passed , however travel advice is regularly updated on the Foreign Office website . 
Let 's hope you are able to go and have a lovely holiday ! 
We are a GP surgery with over 8,000 patients . 
We are obviously awaiting guidance from the Dept of Health . 
In our pandemic flu plan we have been advised by our local PCT to provide 8 masks a day per member of staff - could you clarify the projected usage of a mask - ie : should they be treated like surgical gloves and disposed of after one use ? 
Caroline Dray , Ramsgate , UK Dr Baker : Masks become ineffective when they become damp or after a few hours . 
There has been a lot of debate on the use of facemasks and some authorities say that , in the community , the most effective use is to give to patients who may have symptoms when they present in the surgery - that should help reduce the infectivity of that patient to surgery staff and other patients . 
I expect the Department of Health will issue guidance on use of facemasks if we move into a pandemic phase . 
I have no spleen and I 'm concerned that I will find it hard to fight the flu virus if contracted . 
Is there anything I can do to pre-prepare myself ? 
Stella Lawrence , Norfolk , UK Dr Baker : You should be very careful in having meticulous hand hygiene , washing your hands frequently with soap and water or using alcohol hand rubs . 
Should this become a pandemic strain , some patients -LRB- and people who have had splenectomies may be in this group -RRB- may be directed to take a course of antibiotics if they develop flu symptoms . 
If this course of action is recommended , then GPs will receive guidance and arrangements will be made for patients for whom such treatment is recommended .

2009-05-01,"Matthew Price looks at the impact of the shutdown on businesses in Mexico Mexico has begun a five-day shutdown of parts of its economy in a bid to slow the spread of swine flu . 
Non-essential government services have halted and many businesses like cinemas and restaurants are closed . 
Traditional May Day rallies have been canceled . 
Mexican officials say the spread of the virus - suspected in more than 160 deaths - is slowing , but international experts are more cautious . 
China has now confirmed its first case , taking the tally of nations hit to 14 . 
A Mexican man who had traveled to Hong Kong via Shanghai tested positive for the virus , said Hong Kong 's leader , Donald Tsang . 
The hotel in which the man briefly stayed in Hong Kong has been cordoned off and the alert level raised to emergency , although the authorities have urged residents not to panic . 
In cases outside Mexico the effects of the virus do not appear to be severe , although one death of a Mexican child has been confirmed in the US . 
The WHO has set its pandemic alert level at five - but says it has no immediate plans to move to the highest level of six . 
The shut-down in Mexico covers two public holidays and a weekend . 
US : one death , at least 109 confirmed cases New Zealand : 4 confirmed , 12 probable cases Israel , Costa Rica : 2 confirmed cases each The Netherlands , Switzerland , Austria , Denmark , Hong Kong : 1 confirmed case each Countries with confirmed cases of secondary transmission City authorities say initial evidence suggests infection rates there are slowing . 
Some factories will stop production and schools are already closed . 
Residents have been urged to stay at home . 
But some people say they will ignore it because they can not afford not to work . 
There is also growing concern at the effect the virus could have on Mexico 's already-struggling economy . 
The number of confirmed cases of swine flu infection in Mexico now stands at more than 300 , officials say . 
Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said on Friday that three more deaths from swine flu had been confirmed , bringing the toll to 15 . 
The virus is suspected of causing more than 160 other deaths . 
Announcing the figures , Mr Cordova said that new cases of the virus were levelling off . 
`` The fact that we have a stabilisation in the daily numbers , even a drop , makes us optimistic , '' he said . 
But Dr Keiji Fukuda , acting assistant director general of the World Health Organization , said fluctuations were to be expected . 
`` If it did n't do that -LRB- it -RRB- would be very unusual , '' he said . 
The US has announced that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico An aide to US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu who helped arrange President Obama 's recent trip to Mexico is being tested for swine flu , AP reports , although the aide is said not to have been in contact with the president The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is fine for people without flu symptoms to fly and use the subway , a day after Vice-President Joe Biden said he would advise his own family members against using public transport Denmark reports its first confirmed case of swine flu German authorities confirm that a nurse who treated a patient with swine flu also contracted the disease , in the first person-to-person transmission in the country Test results confirm the UK 's first person-to-person transmission of swine flu , in a friend of a couple from Scotland who were first in the country to be diagnosed with the virus Mexico says it will lodge a formal challenge at the World Trade Organisation demanding explanations from countries that have banned imports of Mexican pork products On Thursday European health ministers held an emergency meeting on measures to tackle the virus , which has now been confirmed in seven European countries . 
SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said Europe was well prepared to handle swine flu and there was `` no need to panic '' . 
The ministers agreed to work with pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine , but rejected a French plan to suspend flights to Mexico . 
Several countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have canceled holidays . 
The WHO , meanwhile , says it will now call the virus influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- rather than swine flu - which it says is misleading as pork meat is safe and the virus is being transmitted from human to human .

2009-05-01,"Friday 1 May 2009 22.47 BST It was a mates ' night out to celebrate a marriage . 
Eight days ago , Graeme Pacitti and friends from his amateur football team gathered to welcome the newly married man back from his honeymoon in Mexico . 
As Pacitti and the others sat around Iain Askham , they noticed he seemed tired . 
That was put down to jetlag but 48 hours later , Askham and his wife , Dawn , were swept into an isolation ward at Monklands hospital , 20 miles away in Airdrie , the first two British cases of swine flu . 
Today , Pacitti , the goalkeeper for their six-a-side team FC Mallard and a clerical worker at Falkirk Royal Infirmary , was confirmed as the first person to catch swine flu within the UK . 
The result left him feeling `` really disappointed '' , he said . 
`` Today I started to feel better than I have done all week . 
I 'm quite gutted . '' 
Confined at home with his mother Lesley , her boyfriend , and his younger brother Alan , he has been taking the anti-viral drug Tamiflu and nursing an aching head and throat . 
`` It started last Saturday when I started to feel like I had an upset stomach . 
From then my throat began to get sore , '' he said . 
`` The worst was when I started to get headaches and feel quite feverish . '' 
Yet earlier this week , Pacitti assumed he had avoided catching the virus . 
He had initially been cleared after he and two other members of that group out drinking with Askham and his best man , Neil Gardner , 26 , developed mild cold-like symptoms . 
But earlier this week , after Pacitti started to feel unwell , further tests confirmed he was carrying the influenza A-type virus the group which includes swine flu , known to the experts at H1N1 . 
But that kind of flu virus is rare in late spring . 
That immediately made it likely that Pacitti was the first case of onward transmission in Britain . 
It has already happened in the US , Canada , Spain and Germany .

2009-05-01,"Pigs to the slaughter in Egypt Amid swine flu hysteria Mubarak has ordered pigs to be killed but is this just another assault on Egypt 's Christian minority ? 
Farmers in Egypt clashed yesterday with officials who had come to destroy their pigs . 
They blocked the roads and some hurled stones at trucks and bulldozers sent by the health ministry . 
The trouble broke out after the government ordered the slaughter of all pigs in Egypt amid a wave of hysteria about `` swine '' flu . 
The Mubarak regime 's record in matters of public health and safety is a dismal one : more than 1,000 dead in a ferry disaster , more than 370 dead in a train fire , 50 dead in a theater fire , plus treacherous roads , and buildings that fall down regularly on top of their occupants . 
Egypt also continues to have cases of bird flu 26 people have died there since 2006 , making it the worst-affected country outside Asia , where the disease originated . 
This time , though , the regime has acted with uncharacteristic haste even before there is a single suspected case of the H1N1 virus in the country , either among humans or even pigs . 
But its decision to kill 300,000-400 ,000 pigs is not just costly . 
It is also pointless . 
As the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation 's chief veterinary officer put it yesterday , the cull is `` a real mistake '' . 
`` There is no reason to do that . 
It 's not a swine influenza , it 's a human influenza , '' he said . 
Time magazine has more , explaining why we should n't blame pigs . 
Not wishing to let science stand in the way of a rousing speech , members of the Egyptian parliament -LRB- whose upper house was carelessly wrecked by fire not so long ago -RRB- have been railing against the enemy within , and calling for pigs to be exterminated or removed from centres of population . 
IslamOnline , the Egyptian-based website supervised for doctrinal correctness by Yusuf al-Qaradawi , also joined in . 
According to an article in its health and science section , `` Egypt has pig breeding farms located in heavily populated areas inside the capital Cairo . 
This means that in case of a swine flu epidemic , the flu will be rapidly transmitted to people living near the pig farms , then to others . '' 
The website also has a discussion forum where readers air their prejudices against pigs . 
There may or may not be an unspoken sub-text to all this but , as everyone in Egypt knows , pig-keeping is associated with the Christian minority who probably account for about 10 % of the country 's population -LRB- the actual figure is a state secret -RRB- . 
For that reason , the response to swine flu ought to have been handled with care and sensitivity . 
Even if it was not intentional , the over-dramatic and obviously ill-planning decision to cull all pigs is likely to be interpreted by Christians as yet another assault on their community . 
It is not even clear if pig-keepers are to be properly compensated . 
Some have reportedly been paid $ 180 per pig after complaining . 
If repeated across the country , that would cost the government tens of millions of dollars which could be far better spent on other things . 
There are also hints , though , that the government may try to wriggle out of paying compensation on the grounds that the dead pigs can be sold for human consumption . 
If that turns out to be the official line it could seriously damage community relations . 
Many of Egypt 's pigs are kept in shacks in cities , in close proximity with humans -LRB- see picture here -RRB- . 
Moving them away from centres of population may be a sensible public health policy regardless of the current flu outbreak but that will also destroy the livelihoods of many urban poor who survive by collecting waste to feed the pigs . 
If it is to be done , though , it will need care and planning to find alternative sources of income for those affected . 
Otherwise , as so often in Egypt , it is likely to make matters worse rather than better .

2009-05-01,"Friday 1 May 2009 21.14 BST People cross a normally busy street in Mexico City . 
The authorities have ordered a five-day shutdown to halt further spread of the H1N1 flu virus . 
Photograph : Joe Raedle\/Getty Images It was the silence more than anything . 
No rumble of traffic . 
No voices in the street . 
Nothing to betray the existence of 20m people . 
The cacophony of noise and life that breaks with the dawn missed its cue in Mexico Citytoday . 
The sun rose higher but it made no difference . 
The avenues stayed empty . 
It was a day of firsts : the first of May . 
The first of a five day nationwide shutdown . 
The first time an epidemic had stilled one of the world 's great cities . 
A first time to do lots of things : sit in the middle of Paseo de la Reforma and not get run over ; stroll through the woods of Bosque de Chapultepec and not see another soul ; have the No 18 bus there was the occasional bus all to yourself . 
For Adriana Mendez , 25 , a tamale seller on Bajio street , it was the first time she was so bereft of customers that she curled up and slept at her stall in the middle of the day . 
`` God , it 's quiet , '' she said , waking up and rubbing her eyes . 
Further up the street there was another glimpse of life : three policeman at a junction waiting for traffic to direct . 
`` I 'm supposed to be training these two cadets but how can I do that if there are no cars ? '' 
said Reyes Alguilar , 62 , a veteran of the force . 
He was cleaning his own car with a red cloth . 
`` Might as well do something useful , right ? '' 
Smog had cleared , revealing an azure sky , but the city felt heavy , expectant . 
The authorities said the H1N1 flu epidemic seemed to be easing and that the five-day lockdown would help snuff out the threat . 
But what if it did n't ? 
What if restaurants , offices , factories , schools , museums would have to remain shut ? 
What if economic pain turned to agony ? 
An opinion poll said that 90 % of Mexicans believe the federal government has responded well or very well to the epidemic but that could swiftly change if the crisis continues . 
Even before the epidemic Mexico had been hit by plunging exports and oil revenues , shrinking the economy by 7 % in the first quarter . 
Tourism , on which many jobs depend , has disappeared . 
`` Its logical that it would be that way and there is not much we can do about it at the moment , '' said the tourism minister , Rodolfo Elisondo . 
It may not help much that there is a t-shirt for sale which bears the image of a pig and the slogan : `` I went to Mexico City and all I got was swine flu . '' 
For the few out on the streets , there was an immediate question : what if the person approaching me is infected ? 
In a pew at the cathedral one worshipper looked in horror at the runny nose of the man beside him and fled . 
Billboard advertising offered mocking reminders of normality . 
The action film Wolverine was supposed to open last week but the premiere was canceled . 
All the cinemas are shut . 
Mexico City resembled a film set for an apocalyptic tale . 
I Am Legend , perhaps , or 28 Days Later , but there were no zombies , just ordinary people making the best of a grim situation . 
On Thursday , as lockdown approached , the only queues were outside DVD shops . 
The most popular rentals were cartoons , said a Blockbuster employee . 
Today was supposed to be workers ' day . 
Normally tens of thousands of flag-wavers would congregate in the Zocalo , a magnifient plaza . 
Fabiano Lopez , a 73-year-old Marxist in a yellow shirt , stood in the empty square holding a red flag . 
It was the only one . 
Capitalism had orchestrated the epidemic , he said . 
`` I 'm not worried . 
My comrades will come later . 
You 'll see . ''

2009-05-01,"Scot confirmed as first UK victim of swine flu who was infected in Britain Clerical worker at Falkirk Royal hospital tests positive as number of confirmed UK cases reaches 13 Friday 1 May 2009 15.49 BST Graeme Pacitti , the first person in Britain to catch swine flu in the UK . 
Photograph : AP A Scottish hospital worker has been confirmed as the first person to catch swine flu from within the UK , after contracting it in a pub from newlyweds who had traveled to Mexico , according to health officials . 
Graeme Pacitti , a clerical worker at the Falkirk Royal hospital , is thought to have caught the virus during a night out with Iain Askham , who contracted it on his honeymoon in Mexico . 
Tonight the Department of Health announced that there were two new cases in the south west and south east . 
The case in the south west is thought to have been a human-to-human transfer within the UK . 
Sir Liam Donaldson , chief medical advisor , said : `` The first non-imported cases of swine flu have been confirmed in England and Scotland . 
The infection appears to have been acquired by person to person spread within the United Kingdom . 
Until now cases were confined to people who had themselves recently come back from Mexico . 
The person in the south west is being treated with Tamiflu . '' 
Tonight 's announcement brought the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 13 . 
Earlier today , a year seven pupil in Gloucestershire , and a woman from Merseyside were also confirmed as suffering from the virus . 
Pacitti , 24 , has been confined to his home in Falkirk under voluntarily quarantine with his mother , Lesley , her partner and his younger brother , Alan , 18 , and has been taking the antiviral drug Tamiflu since becoming ill earlier this week . 
He was given the results from the Health Protection Agency by telephone this afternoon . 
Minutes after getting the results , Pacitti said he was really disappointed . 
`` I 'm gutted really . 
I just found out , '' he said . 
`` I saw Iain last Thursday , he was n't showing any symptoms then . 
My friends thought he looked a bit tired but we thought it was just jetlag . 
`` I 've been feeling a lot better today than I have all week . 
I 've still got an upset stomach and a sore throat . 
Earlier in the week I was having headaches and feeling feverish . '' 
The Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said that authorities believed the virus was still being contained . 
She said : `` This is of course significant because it represents the first case in the UK of person-to-person transmission of this virus . 
The person we 're confirming as positive today had n't been in Mexico or any other affected area . 
He had been in contact with someone who had . 
`` I want to stress , however , that it does n't mean that there is more reason to worry . 
We 're working hard to try to disrupt this infection and stop it spreading . '' 
Sturgeon said that Pacitti 's condition was not causing any medical concern . 
`` I 'm told that his symptoms , as with the other cases , in the context of flu are mild symptoms . 
He is not unwell in a way which would cause clinical concern , as was the case with the other two cases . '' 
This confirmation came as Iain and Dawn Askham , from the small town of Polmont , outside Falkirk , said they believed they caught the virus on the flight home from Mexico from five other men who were clearly ill . 
The five men , who sat in the neighbouring rows of seats to the couple , were coughing and feverish throughout the nine-hour flight from the Mexican resort of Cancun . 
`` I actually said to Dawn : ' I think we 're going to be getting off this plane with the plague ' , '' Askham told the Daily Record , adding the couple were now `` 99 % sure '' they contracted the virus on the flight . 
One other passenger on the flight , a 12-year-old girl from Torbay , in Devon , has since been diagnosed with swine flu . 
Askham said at one point on the flight , two other passengers sitting near the five British Asian men moved seats because of the disturbance from their coughing . 
`` We were on the flight back for nine hours and it would have been impossible not to have breathed in their germs , which will have been getting circulated around the plane , '' he said . 
`` They were really ill , especially the guy sat directly behind us . 
He had a really bad fever . 
We did n't ask to get moved because we 'd have felt a bit rude asking for an upgrade even if it was our honeymoon . '' 
The HPA tried to dampen fears that these five men were at large in the community with swine flu . 
A spokeswoman told the Guardian today that nearly all the passengers within 1 metre of the couple particularly sitting in seats immediately behind and in front of the Askhams had been identified . 
Most had responded to phone calls and emails , and been ruled out as swine flu carriers . 
Some , however , had not yet replied . 
`` Contact tracing has already been done , '' an HPA spokeswoman said . 
`` I ca n't tell you about individual cases because of patient confidentiality . 
`` What I can tell you is that everybody who was in close contact , the 1-metre area for more than an hour obviously anyone near them on a long-haul flight either has been or is being traced . 
That has been going on since the cases were identified as a positive . '' 
Meanwhile , the German health ministry confirmed a nurse as the country 's first case of human-to-human swine flu transmission . 
The World Health Organisation has increased its tally of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus around the world from 257 to 331 . 
"
2009-05-01,"Friday 1 May 2009 22.51 BST What is the significance of the first person-to-person transmission of the H1N1 virus ? 
This is the point at which the virus could , theoretically , start to spread exponentially through the population . 
But it has been taken into account already by officials ; because the new H1N1 virus has already jumped the species barrier into humans , scientists knew the bug would become transmissible between humans at some stage . 
Dr Mark Fielder , a medical microbiologist at Kingston University , says it should not be a major cause for concern . 
`` It 's a fairly mild disease really . 
Its ability to spread between people , while there , is not enormous . '' 
He adds that maintaining good standards of hygiene and following the Health Protection Agency 's advice about regular handwashing and sneezing into tissues would halt the ability of the virus to spread quickly . 
`` The one thing to recognize is that we have n't had that many deaths yet . 
We 've had far more deaths from other diseases going on in the world than we have had from this form of influenza . 
I really do n't see it becoming a major mortality event . 
I see a number of people getting ill , but I 'll hazard it will be no greater than normal seasonal flu . '' 
Have the deaths in Mexico been hyped ? 
Robert Booy , head of clinical research at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance based at the University of Sydney , believes there is a simple explanation for the concentration of more than 100 deaths in Mexico . 
`` It 's likely that this outbreak has been running for not one month or even six weeks , but more than eight weeks -LRB- in Mexico -RRB- . 
Influenza tends to , on average , infect two people for every one case . 
The doubling then occurs every three days , which is the serial interval . 
This means that from day one to day 30 you go to about 1,000 cases , but in the next month , you go to a million . '' 
This means that , if there have been hundreds of thousands of cases already in Mexico , then about 100 deaths gives a mortality rate of 0.1 % . 
`` So the disease may not be nearly as severe as people thought , '' says Booy . 
`` If the disease has been around for two months and infected so many people , many of them must be mildly infected and we have n't heard about them . '' 
Again , this shows that H1N1 is , at the moment , not as lethal as most people might think . 
What are scientists doing now ? 
Samples of the H1N1 virus arrived at the National Institute for Medical Research in north London this week and scientists there will now grow the virus structure and see how it might evolve . 
Working with the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia , the research will help develop a vaccine for the virus in the coming months .

2009-05-01,"Policemen wearing protective masks restrict access to a hotel Hong Kong May 1 , 2009 . 
Hong Kong government has confirmed on Friday a Mexican from Shanghai , who has stayed in the hotel , got influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . 
HONG KONG | Fri May 1 , 2009 6:23 pm BST HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Hong Kong confirmed Asia 's first case of the new H1N1 flu virus in a Mexican traveler on Friday , prompting authorities to seal off the hotel where the 25-year old man had been staying . 
Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang told reporters the man arrived on a China Eastern flight on Thursday afternoon after a stopover in Shanghai . 
He had a fever and went to Ruttonjee Hospital for help on Thursday evening , Tsang said . 
The Mexican is now in hospital in a stable condition . 
The confirmation of the H1N1 infection was made by a laboratory at the University of Hong Kong . 
`` He did n't leave the hotel -LRB- except to go to hospital -RRB- because he was feeling sick , '' Health Minister York Chow told a news conference . 
Two companions of the Mexican and a friend he met in Hong Kong were now in isolation wards at another hospital , he said . 
Tsang said he had accepted the recommendation of government health experts to seal off the Metropark hotel in Wanchai district where the Mexican was staying . 
Dozens of police wearing surgical masks stood guard both inside and outside the hotel late on Friday . 
Hotel guests were prevented from leaving while outsiders could not get in . 
`` I assure you the Hong Kong government will try its best to conquer the virus , '' Tsang said . 
`` At the present moment , I would prefer to do it more stringently instead of missing the opportunity to control the spread of the virus . '' 
Chow said the hotel had about 200 guests and over 100 staff and they would be quarantined for seven days . 
He urged those who were not in the hotel as well as taxi drivers who took the Mexican to the hotel and to hospital to report to authorities . 
The drastic action left some visitors distressed . 
Cinmei Sinaga from Indonesia was left standing for hours on the pavement with her eight-month-old daughter . 
`` I do n't feel that they are doing anything to help me . 
I just need my passport but we can not go to another hotel and my baby needs to sleep . 
I feel scared , '' she told Reuters . 
The affluent financial hub on the south coast of China is widely seen as one of the best-prepared Asian cities to deal with the new H1N1 flu virus , given its experience in handling sporadic outbreaks of H5N1 avian flu , as well as SARS in 2003 which killed 299 people . 
The order to seal off the Metropark hotel brought back memories of how SARS started in Hong Kong in February 2003 . 
A doctor from mainland China who knew he had been infected with SARS had traveled to Hong Kong to try to seek medical help . 
But before he could get admitted to hospital , he infected eight people in a lift lobby of the Metropole hotel where he was staying . 
Some of them then went on to spread the disease in Hong Kong , Singapore , Canada and Vietnam . 
To tackle the H1N1 flu virus , Hong Kong authorities have beefed up surveillance at airports and hospitals , improved public health response systems and stockpiled over 20 million doses of the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu .

In addition to removing all pillows and blankets from its fleet of 114 planes , Alaska is conducting comprehensive interior surface cleaning of all aircraft during overnight maintenance using a disinfectant and sanitizer with `` virucidal '' -LRB- virus - killing -RRB- performance against multiple types of flu . 
The cleaner , registered with the Environmental Protection Agency , provides a lasting microbial barrier to prevent recontamination of surfaces . 
Surfaces receiving special attention include walls , windows and shades , seat belts and buckles , armrests , tray tables , seat backs , passenger air vents , overhead bin doors and handles , and galleys and lavatories . 
Aircraft arriving from Mexico are also receiving an additional , thorough interior surface cleaning before boarding for the next flight begins . 
Alaska 's fleet uses air conditioning systems with HEPA filters that remove 99.7 percent of airborne particulates , reducing the potential for the spread of bacterial and viral organisms through cabin air . 
These filters are checked and changed according to a regular maintenance schedule to ensure optimal performance . 
Cabin air is refreshed through these systems more than 30 times an hour . 
Alaska was the only domestic network carrier to earn this distinction .

2009-05-01,"CIBOLO , Texas | Fri May 1 , 2009 1:22 pm EDT CIBOLO , Texas -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - When Hayden Henshaw came down with a new and worrying kind of influenza last month , he thought he had strep throat . 
Henshaw , 18 , and a senior at Steele High School northeast of San Antonio , was among the first U.S. patients to catch a new strain of the H1N1 swine flu virus , which has spread to 13 countries . 
Within days Henshaw 's fever spiked to 102 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- 39 degrees Celsius -RRB- , and he was confined to bed . 
`` I could n't lift my head up to get out of bed to take a drink . 
I was really sick , '' said Henshaw , who along with his family have been under voluntary quarantine for a week . 
`` I could n't stop coughing . '' 
Mexico , the worst-hit country , has reported as many as 176 deaths from the virus . 
Cases have been reported around the world , mostly among travelers from Mexico , but they have been mild and most people recovered so far with little or no treatment . 
The only death outside Mexico was a Mexican toddler visiting Texas . 
Henshaw has recovered and is feeling better . 
But he 's still confined to his two-story stucco house , along with his family , who were advised by local health officials to remain in `` voluntary quarantine . '' 
A `` do not disturb '' sign hangs from the front door and the phone has been turned off in an attempt to ward off an onslaught of calls from journalists . 
Inside , surgical masks hang from the doors and cans of Lysol and hand sanitizers are in plentiful supply . 
Henshaw said he has grown tired of television and video games , and fears to venture onto the Internet because his class-mates are blaming him and two other flu-infected classmates for interrupting their lives . 
`` I tell them , hey , I did n't ask for any of this , '' he said . 
`` I just want to leave . '' 
`` It 's been a constant turmoil , '' said Patrick Henshaw , Hayden 's father . 
`` It 's like we 've done something wrong or something . ''

2009-05-01,"S. Goldsmith and A. Balish\/Centers for Disease Control\/Handout By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Fri May 1 , 2009 9:46 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new virus that has killed as many as 177 people and spread globally is a mongrel that appears to have mixed with another hybrid virus containing swine , bird and human bits , U.S. researchers reported on Thursday . 
Raul Rabadan and colleagues at Columbia University in New York analyzed the published genetic sequences from the H1N1 virus that has brought the world to the brink of a pandemic . 
`` The closest relatives to the virus we have found are swine viruses , '' Rabadan said in a telephone interview . 
`` Six segments of the virus are related to swine viruses from North America and the other two from swine viruses isolated in Europe\/Asia , '' they wrote in the online journal Eurosurveillance . 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week after discovering this virus in two U.S. children that it had four virus types -- two swine , an avian and a human component . 
It may be even more complex than that . 
Influenza viruses mutate constantly and they also swap genetic material with one another promiscuously , especially if an animal or person is infected with two strains at once . 
Rabadan 's team said this particular strain looked partly like another hybrid , or what scientists call a reassortant , virus . 
`` The North American ancestors are related to the multiple reassortants , H1N2 and H3N2 swine viruses isolated in North America since 1998 , '' they wrote . 
`` In particular , the swine H3N2 isolates from 1998 were a triple reassortment of human , swine and avian origin . '' 
Scientists can study those genetics to try to track the origin of the new virus . 
Mexican officials have denied it came from pigs in Mexico and pork producers have been battling rumors it could have come from pig farms there . 
Rabadan said the findings did not show the virus came directly from pigs . 
`` We do n't know how long this virus has been in humans , '' he said . 
Many different influenza strains are circulating at any given time and pandemic strains -- the ones that cause global outbreaks from a whole new strain -- are believed to have come from animals . 
`` We know that with the two pandemics in 1957 and 1968 they were coming from a mixture of human and avian viruses , '' Rabadan said . 
The H1N1 strain that caused the far more serious 1918 pandemic appears to have been virtually a pure avian strain , according to published analyses .

2009-05-01,"Clinton has `` mild allergies , '' not new flu U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has twice been to Mexico in recent weeks , and so when she appeared at two State Department events on Friday with a cough and apparent cold symptoms , reporters asked an obvious question . 
Did the top U.S. diplomat possibly get the new H1N1 swine flu during her trips to Mexico in late March and with U.S. President Barack Obama last month ? 
`` You 'll be happy to know it 's just mild allergies . 
She suffers from mild allergies . 
That 's all it is , '' said State Department spokesman Robert Wood when asked about Clinton 's health . 
Another aide said Clinton has had allergies for a long time . 
The flu virus has killed up to 176 people in Mexico and since spread to the United States , where there has been one death .

2009-05-01,"KANSAS CITY | Fri May 1 , 2009 8:34 pm EDT KANSAS CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Humans have it . 
At least not yet , and U.S. pork producers are doing everything they can to make sure that the new H1N1 virus , known around the world as the `` swine flu , '' stays out of their herds . 
`` That is the biggest concern , that your herd could somehow contract this illness from an infected person , '' said Kansas hog farmer Ron Suther , who is banning visitors from his sow barns and requiring maintenance workers , delivery men and other strangers to report on recent travels and any illness before they step foot on his property . 
`` If a person is sick , we do n't want you coming anywhere on the farm , '' Suther said . 
Those sentiments were echoed by producers around the nation this week as fears of a possible global flu pandemic grew , with more than 200 people sickened , including more than 100 in the United States , and at least 177 dead , all but one in Mexico . 
`` There is no evidence of this new strain being in our pig populations in the United States . 
And our concern very much is we do n't want a sick human to come into our barns and transmit this new virus to our pigs , '' said National Pork Producers chief veterinarian Jennifer Greiner . 
`` If humans give it to pigs , we do n't have things like Tamiflu for pigs . 
We do n't have antivirals . 
We have no treatment other than to give them aspirin , '' said Greiner . 
The World Health Organization on Thursday officially declared it would stop calling the new strain of flu `` swine flu , '' because no pigs in any country have been determined to have the illness and the origination of the strain has not been determined . 
The never-before-seen H1N1 flu virus has elements of swine , avian and human varieties . 
Still , U.S. hog farmers said flu fears have hit them hard in the wallet as hog prices plummeted this week in response . 
Many countries reacted to the outbreak earlier this week by banning pork or meat from U.S. states that have human cases of the flu . 
And Egypt ordered the slaughter of all pigs in the country as a precaution . 
U.S. hog producers have already been struggling financially for more than a year due to poor prices and high feed costs . 
If the new flu strain does hit their herds , it could spur further price declines , and could potentially spread broadly through herds . 
To try to protect against such a scenario , industry groups and veterinarians this week warned farmers to step up their biosafety protocols , keeping pigs in barns behind security fences with access by any outsiders extremely limited . 
Purdue University veterinarian Sandy Amass said farmers should keep an eye on pigs for `` coughing , runny nose , fever and a reduction in feed intake , '' and to have the animals tested immediately if they exhibit such flu symptoms . 
`` Pigs get flu just like people get flu , '' Amass said . 
`` We 're want to do everything possible so the pigs do n't get infected . '' 
For Carroll , Iowa , producer Craig Rowles that means if any of his workers feel sick , they are ordered to take time off work -- paid -- to keep them away from the pigs . 
`` It 's a real issue , '' Rowles said . 
`` If the pigs get it , there is n't much we can do . 
Water , aspirin , and bed rest , that 's all we 've got . ''

2009-05-01,"WASHINGTON | Fri May 1 , 2009 5:03 pm BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The outbreak of a new and worrying kind of influenza in Mexico may not be as severe as it first looked , with many mild cases that were not immediately noticed , U.S. health experts reported on Friday . 
Health workers are rushing to get a fuller picture of the outbreak of H1N1 swine flu , which the World Health Organization fears could tip into a pandemic . 
Mexico , the worst-hit country , has reported 176 deaths from the new strain of the H1N1 virus . 
Cases have been reported around the world , mostly among travelers from Mexico , but they have been mild and most people recovered so far with little or no treatment . 
The only death outside Mexico was a Mexican toddler visiting Texas . 
Experts have been struggling to explain why so many deaths in Mexico and nowhere else , but the CDC report suggests there is a simple explanation -- there are many cases in Mexico , most are mild , and just the bad ones have been seen so far . 
`` The clinical spectrum of swine-origin influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus illness is not yet well characterized in Mexico . 
However , evidence suggests that swine-origin influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus transmission is widespread and that less severe -LRB- uncomplicated -RRB- illness is common , '' the CDC said in a special report . 
`` To date , case-finding in Mexico has focused on patients seeking care in hospitals , and the selection of cases for laboratory testing has focused on patients with more severe disease . 
Therefore , a large number of undetected cases of illness might exist in persons seeking care in primary-care settings or not seeking care at all . '' 
But more information is needed , the CDC team stressed . 
The CDC has sent test kits to Mexico that will help get a better picture of who is sick . 
It is difficult to know without special tests because respiratory diseases are so common and many infection look like flu . 
`` Additional investigations are needed urgently to evaluate the full clinical spectrum of disease in Mexico , the proportion of patients who have severe illness , and the extent of disease transmission , '' the CDC said . 
Even garden-variety flu can be deadly , with seasonal influenza killing an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 people globally every year .

2009-05-02,"Police are guarding the Hong Kong hotel where the man stayed About 300 people at a Hong Kong hotel have been placed under quarantine after a guest there became China 's first confirmed swine flu case . 
The 25-year-old man , who is now in hospital after testing positive for the virus , had traveled from Mexico via Shanghai , Hong Kong 's leader said . 
Local TV footage showed police wearing masks guarding the hotel exits . 
Meanwhile , the UK joined Canada , Spain , Germany and the US in reporting person-to-person transmission of the virus . 
On Friday , French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said two people were infected with swine flu , France 's first confirmed cases . 
South Korea has also confirmed its first case , local media said . 
The announcements take to 16 the number of countries where swine flu has been confirmed . 
Mexico , where the outbreak began , has shut down parts of its economy for five days in a bid to curb the virus 's progress . 
Late on Friday , Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova announced the confirmed death toll from the virus had risen by one , to 16 . 
`` The mortality rate is n't as great as could be expected , '' said Mr Cordova . 
`` The majority of the deaths are women . '' 
Mexican officials say the spread of swine flu - suspected in more than 380 deaths - is slowing . 
International experts are more cautious - but one , Nancy Cox , chief of America 's Center for Disease Control 's influenza division , said the new virus lacked the traits that made the 1918 pandemic so deadly . 
`` We do not see the markers for virulence that were seen in the 1918 virus , '' she said . 
In cases outside Mexico the effects of the virus do not appear to be severe , although one death of a Mexican child has been confirmed in the US . 
The WHO has set its pandemic alert level at five - but says it has no immediate plans to move to the highest level of six . 
In Hong Kong , the authorities have raised the alert level to emergency but urged residents to carry on life as normal . 
US : One death , at least 141 confirmed cases New Zealand : 4 confirmed , 12 probable cases The Netherlands , Switzerland , Austria , Denmark , Hong Kong , South Korea : 1 confirmed case each Countries with confirmed cases of secondary transmission `` I stress we do n't need to panic . '' 
The Mexican man is said to be in a stable condition in Hong Kong 's Princess Margaret Hospital , after seeking treatment on Thursday night after becoming unwell . 
The Metropark Hotel in Wanchai district where he briefly stayed will be sealed off for seven days , health officials said , and the antiviral drug Tamiflu given to about 200 guests and 100 staff there . 
Medical staff wearing protective clothing were seen carrying boxes of equipment into the building . 
Efforts are also under way to trace people who traveled on the same flights as the Mexican , and taxi drivers with whom he came into contact . 
BBC China Editor Shirong Chen says confirmation that the man has tested positive for the virus has set alarm bells ringing beyond Hong Kong . 
Chinese Health Minister Chen Zhu said the virus was very likely to enter mainland China and urged the country to prepare for an outbreak , as millions start traveling over the May Day long weekend . 
In South Korea , a 51-year-old woman who had recently returned from Mexico was confirmed as the country 's first case , Yonhap news agency reported . 
Two other people are being tested for the virus , the agency said . 
Meanwhile , the authorities in Mexico hope a nationwide shut-down ordered from Friday , covering two public holidays and a weekend , will help curb the spread of the virus . 
SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection Some factories will stop production and schools are already closed . 
Residents have been urged to stay at home , but it is not clear how widely the shut-down order will be followed . 
The number of confirmed cases of swine flu infection in Mexico now stands at more than 300 , officials say . 
Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said on Friday that three more deaths from swine flu had been confirmed , bringing the toll to 15 . 
Announcing the figure , Mr Cordova said that new cases of the virus were levelling off . 
But Dr Keiji Fukuda , acting assistant director general of the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , said fluctuations were to be expected . 
The US announces that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico A flight from Germany to Washington DC is diverted to Boston after a female passenger complains of flu-like symptoms An aide to US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu who helped arrange President Barack Obama 's recent trip to Mexico is being tested for swine flu , although the aide is said not to have been in contact with the president The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is fine for people without flu symptoms to fly and use the subway , a day after Vice-President Joe Biden said he would advise his own family members against using public transport Denmark reports its first confirmed case of swine flu German authorities confirm that a nurse who treated a patient with swine flu also contracted the disease , in the first person-to-person transmission in the country Test results confirm the UK 's first person-to-person transmission of swine flu , in a friend of a couple from Scotland who were first in the country to be diagnosed with the virus Several countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have canceled holidays . 
The WHO , meanwhile , says it will now call the virus influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- rather than swine flu - which it says is misleading as pork meat is safe and the virus is being transmitted from human to human .

2009-05-02,"Did Mexico over-react on swine flu ? 
As tests suggest the swine flu virus in Mexico may be less virulent than first feared , the BBC 's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City looks at whether the response was an over-reaction . 
Pedro Aparicio stocked up on food so his family would not need to go outside Pedro Aparicio shows me his receipt from the supermarket . 
`` My wife thinks I spent too much , '' he says . 
Just before the partial shutdown of this country , the primary school teacher stocked up on everything he thinks he , his wife , and their young daughter Naomi will need for the next five days . 
`` Milk , beans , tuna fish , everything , '' he says , as he shows me his fully-stocked fridge . 
`` We are under quarantine . '' 
I remind him that the country 's partial shutdown of the economy does not include supermarkets . 
`` But we do n't want to go out , it might be risky , '' he says . 
A little over a week ago , this global health crisis was triggered when the Mexican government announced that it had detected a new strain of flu virus , and was closing all schools . 
It informed the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- that it suspected 60 people had already been killed by what soon became known as swine flu . 
So many deaths , after apparently a very short time , worried the Mexican authorities . 
`` We were spooked , '' one government official admitted to me . 
`` People seemed to be dying , and we did n't know why . '' 
It takes several days for tests for swine flu infection to be verified But when those first figures were released , the word `` suspected '' was crucial . 
Mexico was not certain at that stage that 60 people had been killed by swine flu . 
And it still does not know . 
It takes several days for tests to be properly verified . 
The current , confirmed , death toll stands at 16 . 
Initial data indicates that apparent mortality rate is comparable to that of seasonal flu . 
In the grandiose health ministry building in central Mexico City , I sat down with the country 's Health Minister , Jose Angel Cordova . 
As a nod to the enduring risk of infection , he prefers not to shake hands these days , instead offering the sleeve of his perfectly cut suit . 
I asked him whether he thought that his government had initially over-estimated the deadliness of the virus . 
`` Maybe , yes , '' he said . 
But he stressed that his experts were dealing with so many unknowns at that stage . 
What they did know was that the virus was potentially virulent and potentially deadly . 
Humans had no natural resistance to it . 
As they tried to work out who was dying of what and why , it is worth remembering some complicating facts , which are peculiar to Mexico . 
You can imagine that right now there is a lot of paranoia Most of the suspected fatalities were , and still are , in the capital , Mexico City . 
The city is at an elevation of 2,300 m -LRB- 7,540 ft -RRB- . 
It is home to almost 23 million people . 
Most days , a thick polluted smog can be seen hanging over the vast metropolis . 
Every year , swine flu or not , over half a million cases of respiratory problems are reported in the city . 
`` You can imagine that right now there is a lot of paranoia , '' says Dr Franciso Moreno , an expert in infectious diseases at the ABC medical center in Mexico City . 
`` About 90 % of the patients who have come to the hospital in the last few days have mild respiratory problems , from other causes . '' 
The deluge of suspected cases has made it extremely difficult to tell who has swine flu , and who does not . 
H1N1 has had consequences which few would have ever predicted . 
Something which possibly began in rural communities in Mexico has led to the quarantine of a luxury hotel in Hong Kong , and the slaughter of all the pigs in Egypt . 
And has this all been a global false alarm ? 
The Mexican health minister says it is still too early to say . 
He says that the threat of new viruses should not be under-estimated . 
As he spends the bank holiday weekend watching TV with his family , Pedro Aparicio says he thinks that the government did exactly the right thing . 
`` You ca n't be too careful , '' he says .

2009-05-02,"Graeme Pacitti -LRB- right -RRB- became the rst to catch the virus from another person -- friend Iain Askham -LRB- left -RRB- . 
Photograph : PA Two Britons have now contracted swine flu within the UK , it was confirmed yesterday , as the total number of cases rose to 13 . 
Graeme Pacitti , a clerical worker at Falkirk Royal Infirmary , became the first person confirmed with the disease who had not visited Mexico . 
He is thought to have become infected after a night out with Iain Askham , a football team-mate who contracted the virus on his honeymoon in Canc n , Mexico . 
Late last night the Health Protection Agency confirmed that a 42-year-old from south Gloucestershire who had not visited Mexico had become infected in England . 
Sir Liam Donaldson , the government 's chief medical adviser , said : `` The first non-imported cases of swine flu have been confirmed in England and Scotland . 
The infection appears to have been acquired by person-to-person spread within the United Kingdom . 
`` Until now cases were confined to people who had recently come back from Mexico . 
The person in the south-west is being treated with Tamiflu . '' 
A 12-year-old girl was also among five new cases , prompting the immediate closure of her school in south Gloucestershire . 
The girl , a pupil at Downend School , was on the same flight as Askham and his wife , Dawn . 
Government scientists who are studying the virus said early analysis showed it was likely to cause only a mild epidemic , probably no worse than anything seen in a normal flu season . 
Biologists at the National Institute for Medical Research in London said that antiviral medicines such as Tamiflu would probably control the spread of the disease . 
Pacitti , 24 , was the 10th confirmed case of swine flu in the UK , while earlier yesterday a Merseyside woman who had recently returned from Mexico was confirmed as the ninth . 
Referring to Pacitti , the Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said : `` This is significant as it represents the first case in the UK of person-to - person transmission of this virus . 
The person had n't been in Mexico or any other affected area . 
He had been in contact with someone who had . 
`` I want to stress , however , that it does n't mean that there is more reason to worry . 
We 're working hard to try to disrupt this infection and stop it spreading . '' 
The Health Protection Agency said : `` We are working to ensure that any close contacts of patients who test positive for swine influenza are offered antivirals as a precautionary measure . 
At this stage close contacts who should be offered antivirals -LRB- are those -RRB- who have been exposed to a probable or confirmed case within the previous seven days for longer than one hour and within a distance of one metre . '' 
The agency advised people returning from affected areas in Mexico who become unwell within seven days of their return to stay at home and contact their GP by phone or ring NHS Direct . 
The agency said it was aware of head teachers and governors considering temporary closure of schools as a precaution when suspected cases of infection were still under investigation but had yet to be confirmed . 
But it advised these measures only when a case is strongly suspected or confirmed within a school . 
Earlier yesterday Gordon Brown offered reassurance that Britain was well-placed to deal with the outbreak . 
On a visit to an NHS Direct call center in Beckenham , south-east London , he said the advice line was coping well with demand . 
The government was increasing the number of face masks available to the NHS and looking at different vaccines , while stressing that the Tamiflu antiviral drug would deal with the disease . 
Brown added : `` This is happening in every country of the world , but we are better prepared . 
If people have the symptoms they should ask for advice as quickly as possible . 
`` We are finding with NHS Direct that they can both reassure people and give people advice about where to go . 
This is a system that 's working , it 's calm , it 's ordered , it 's giving people the right information . '' 
Brown said all the cases in the UK were mild . 
The Netherlands , France and Switzerland confirmed their first cases of swine flu yesterday , bringing the total number of countries affected to 12 . 
There have been 248 deaths linked to the virus in Mexico , with 12 confirmed . 
The other countries affected are the United States , Canada , New Zealand , Germany , Spain , Israel and Austria .

2009-05-02,"Just as an unsustainable financial system caused the current banking crisis , the intensive farming of animals is at the heart of the swine flu pandemic A litter of pigs . 
Photograph : Christopher Furlong\/Getty Images In modern disaster management theory , when any large system experiences a major shock or failure , you assess the risk , activate an ordered emergency response , and manage the after-effects . 
In the world of real people hit directly by the real shock , you look for someone to blame . 
For ordinary Mexicans this week , who faced the shutdown of their country by swine flu and an unknown number of deaths , it was a culprit that was needed . 
The Fred Goodwin of the epidemic was easy to identify in their eyes . 
Just five miles from the town of La Gloria , which appears to be the epicentre of the flu outbreak , is a giant industrial pig complex jointly owned by the world 's largest pig processor , Smithfield Foods . 
Smithfield is adamant that the swine flu is not of its making and has no connection to its factory farms in Mexico or in any of the countries where it has established its powerful presence . 
By the end of the week , the company had , like a besieged banker , gone into shutdown mode and declined to give interviews , but it issued a statement : `` We have found no evidence of the presence of influenza virus in any of our pig herds or any of our employees at any of our worldwide operations . 
All our herds are tested regularly for disease including influenza . 
We routinely administer flu vaccines to protect them and conduct monthly tests to examine the presence and identity of different flu strains . '' 
When a young boy from La Gloria who had been ill in March became the earliest confirmed case of the current swine flu outbreak , following new tests by the US Centre for Disease Control -LRB- CDC -RRB- on previously cleared samples from Mexico , Smithfield said it too was re-examining its herds . 
It was confident that it could reassure people who have been `` bombarded by unfounded opinions , non-scientific statements and unrestrained internet rumor and speculation '' that it was not the source . 
It declined to answer the Guardian 's detailed questions on its tests . 
The results were not due till this weekend . 
Like the rest of the world watching a pandemic unfold as though in a slow-motion car crash , Smithfield could do little but wait to see how hard or soft the landing would be . 
Smithfield 's predicament has not been helped by the fact that , like Sir Fred , it has made itself somewhat conspicuous with its habits . 
It operates on a grand scale . 
The volume of its pig waste is extravagant . 
But just as RBS did not alone cause the financial crisis but merely conformed to the latest banking type , so it is the very nature of today 's globalised meat industry that is at the heart of this emerging swine flu pandemic . 
The factory unit near La Gloria fattens nearly a million pigs a year . 
Globally Smithfield slaughtered 26 million pigs in 2006 , generating sales of $ 11.4 bn -LRB- # 7.6 bn -RRB- and profits of $ 421m . 
It already controls over a quarter of the total US processed pork market and it has expanded by acquisition in Europe . 
Like the banking sector , the global food system has seen the emergence of unprecedentedly large players that are dominant at every stage of production from pig breeding to bacon slicing . 
The modern food system has a sophistication and global interdependence to match the financial system , too . 
It looks too big to fail . 
But like that sector , it is also extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable to shock . 
Many of the shocks are likely to be of its own making . 
Smithfield 's intensive factories of densely packed hogs , like those of the rest of the large-scale industry , produce vast lagoons of foul-smelling discharges . 
In many of the areas where it has sited its factory farms or slaughtering and processing complexes , activists and locals have campaigned against it , accusing it of environmental pollution , labor rights abuses and in some places operating without proper permits . 
The people of La Gloria have had long run-ins with the company 's nearby subsidiary Granjas Carroll . 
When 60 % of the town 's population became ill in March with flu-like symptoms , they quickly blamed the pigs . 
Swine flu is currently being passed from human to human , and it is possible that this particular strain of swine flu was created without ever seeing a pig directly , as UN 's Food and Agriculture Organisation 's -LRB- FAO -RRB- experts on animal health point out . 
The FAO has , however , dispatched a surveillance mission to help the Mexicans check their pig herds . 
But the focus on Smithfield is not surprising given its history . 
It won notoriety a decade ago when two of its US subsidiaries were given the largest ever environmental fines by the government 's Environmental Protection Agency , having to pay $ 12.6 m for illegally discharging pollutants from its operations in to the Pagan river in Virginia . 
It had committed more than 5,000 violations of permit levels for discharging faecal coli forms , phosphorus , ammonia , cyanide and oil from its pig factories over more than five years , destroying fish stocks and polluting water tables . 
Even more troublingly , it was also found guilty of falsifying documents and destroying records . 
And as expert labs continued their forensic work through the week , the ancestry of this latest strain of flu and its connection with modern intensive pig farming in general if not with any farm in particular was established . 
By Wednesday night the reason why scientists had pressed the full flu alert button even though only a few hundred cases outside Mexico , almost all mild at that point , had appeared , also became clearer . 
At CDC the head of virology had completed the genetic fingerprinting of the swine flu and was able to say that it has arisen from a strain first identified on industrial pig units in North Carolina in the late 1990s . 
It is no coincidence that this threat to global human health should have emerged from that particular state , as Michael Greger , director of public health at the US Humane Society and leading author on the history of bird and animal flu explains : `` North Carolina has the densest pig population in North America and boasts more than twice as many corporate swine mega-factories as any other state . 
With massive concentrations of farm animals within which to mutate , these new swine flu viruses in North America seem to be on an evolutionary fast track , jumping and reassorting between species at an unprecedented rate . '' 
Novel human disease is the toxic debt of today 's industrial livestock farming . 
The influenza virus has eight genetic segments . 
If two different types of flu infect the same cell at the same time , the genes from both viruses mix , swapping segments to form totally new hybrids . 
In Mexico as in many poorer countries , industrial pig and poultry farms are increasingly sited close to crowded urban populations , making simultaneous infection by different flu strains more likely . 
The 1918 flu pandemic was an H1N1 strain and was a kind of bird flu new to humans so they had no immunity to it . 
It killed at least 50 million people as it raged around the world in less than a year . 
The 1918 H1N1 strain passed from humans to pigs , and became the dominant form of flu among pigs , albeit one that evolved into a fairly mild strain . 
But then in 1998 there was an explosive new outbreak of swine flu in a factory farm in North Carolina that made thousands of pigs ill . 
The virus had evolved into a triple hybrid that had never been seen before , containing gene segments from bird , human and swine flu . 
It had found the ideal breeding ground . 
Pigs , whose immune systems were suppressed by the stress of crowding and fast feeding , and kept confined indoors , were perfect disease incubators for flu whose preferred method of transmission is virus-infected aerosol droplets , expelled by the million in the hog 's famous barking cough . 
Thanks to the modern practice of transporting live animals , the new virus spread rapidly through pig herds around the country . 
Six of the eight genetic segments of today 's swine flu outbreak isolated by CDC experts can be traced back to the triple hybrid from North Carolina . 
Factory animal farming has developed as a giant ecological credit bubble . 
It has delivered enormous growth in global meat production over the last three decades . 
Consumers have happily bought its cheap products just as they gobbled up the freely-offered loans of the financial boom without asking too closely how such consumption could be sustained or what the eventual consequences might be . 
Swine flu should make us question that complacency . 
Jan Slingenbergh , a senior animal health officer at the FAO believes the precise final evolution of the current virus may never be found . 
`` We do n't know , but what is most likely is that a human was infected by a common flu virus and at the same time with a second virus which had elements probably from pigs and they mixed to form a new virus . 
The last bit of human mixing probably took place around mid-March in Mexico . '' 
Slingenbergh is sceptical that a link will be found to the Granjas Carroll factory . 
The current virus may now progress as a mild strain and die down or it may mutate and evolve further to become more virulent . 
The reason experts have invested so much effort in preparing for a flu pandemic and are taking this one so seriously , is that these rapidly evolving strains that mix bird , pig and human forms could throw up a particularly deadly variety . 
Health experts have warned for years about the danger of intensive livestock farming creating new and rampant human disease . 
If these new viruses are the toxic debt of the food system , the genetically improved pig is its highly engineered and artificial derivative . 
Pumped up like a bodybuilder , dependent on antibiotics and vaccines to keep it going , it has disproportionately large back legs to meet a market that likes hams more than shoulder of pork ; it has tiny ears and no tail to limit the scars from the aggressive behavior distressed conditions produce ; and it is bred without hair for ease of slaughter . 
When herds of 5,000 of these genetically identical modern animals catch flu , it rips through them . 
Large-scale producers pride themselves on their economic efficiency , but if the true costs of such polluting and disease-harbouring methods were internalised rather than externalised as environmental debts , they would be anything but good value . 
The cost of the flu pandemic will be unquantifiably large , but it is not the industry that will pay . 
Instead , the damage will affect the poorest disproportionately . 
It is ordinary Mexicans who are most affected now , just as the sub-prime mortgage crisis has made those at the bottom of the ladder homeless . 
Where the next shocks to the food system will come from is unpredictable . 
As well as outbreaks of disease , climate change may produce a sudden dislocation in supplies . 
A coincidence of drought in two or more grain producing countries could , for example , lead to price spikes and shortages . 
An energy crisis could expose how dependent our food system has become on an uninterrupted flow of oil and transport - earlier this year , after just two days of snow , there were worries that London might not be able to maintain its food supplies , according to Rosie Boycott , chairman of the mayor 's London Food board . 
Official government figures show that there has been a steady erosion of any slack in the system . 
In the UK , stocks of all food are typically down to 11 days of supply . 
The UK now carries just eight days ' worth of stocks of frozen foods , and 10 days of perishable goods . 
Globally , grain stocks are down to 50 days . 
Tim Lang , professor of food policy at City University and a member of the government 's Sustainable Development Commission , warns that the whole British food network has become taut . 
`` In that last 30-40 years there has been enormous investment in what is called efficiency , '' he says . 
`` That means there is no spare . 
The food system is like a fully stretched rubber band . 
If it breaks , there would be a sharp rebound . 
I do n't think a systemic failure is imminent but it is very vulnerable to shocks . 
They could be technical shocks , ecological shocks or human disease shocks . 
We do n't have a sustainable UK agriculture base at the moment and we need one . '' 
But instead of addressing these wider issues , the response to the flu pandemic in terms of food production is `` carry on as normal '' . 
Urged to spend our way out of ecological recession , we are exhorted to keep eating pork products . 
Keen to protect the economic interests of its meat industry , the US government took to calling this swine flu `` H1N1 flu '' a couple of days ago , in order not to put people off their chops . 
The World Health Organisation , which depends on the US for a large part of its budget and has been bullied by it before , has now followed suit , rebranding the flu influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . 
But simply saying `` as you were '' is no more an adequate response to the cause of this current crisis than it is to the banking collapse . 
If we carry on as before , the pigs may yet have their revenge . 
And if not the pigs , the chickens .

2009-05-02,"MEXICO CITY | Sat May 2 , 2009 7:53 pm EDT MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mexico 's flu outbreak appeared to be stabilizing on Saturday but officials warned the unpredictable virus still threatened a global pandemic . 
Mexican officials said hospitals were seeing fewer new cases of people with symptoms from the new swine flu virus and cut the estimated death toll from the outbreak . 
`` It would still be imprudent to say that we 're past the worst of it but I do think ... we are in a stage of stabilization , '' Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told reporters . 
Costa Rica , Italy , and Ireland confirmed cases of the virus , which has now been found in 18 countries . 
In Geneva , the World Health Organization said H1N1 influenza had not spread in a sustained way outside North America , as would be required before the pandemic alert level is raised to its highest level . 
But it said that would probably happen soon . 
`` I would still propose that a pandemic is imminent because we are seeing the disease spread , '' Michael Ryan , WHO director of Global Alert and Response , told a briefing . 
Few are ready to take chances with the new virus , widely dubbed swine flu . 
In Hong Kong , police quarantined a hotel after a Mexican guest fell ill with the virus , which may have killed more than 100 people in Mexico , the worst-hit country . 
Mexico called the action `` unjustified '' and advised its citizens to avoid travel to China . 
Mexican authorities cut their suspected death toll to up to 101 from as many as 176 as more test samples came back negative . 
Fewer patients with severe flu symptoms were checking into hospitals , suggesting a falling infection rate , and no new deaths were reported in Mexico City in the past two days . 
The World Health Organization said 15 countries had reported 615 infections , not including the later reports of confirmed cases in Ireland , Italy and Costa Rica . 
The United States , the second hardest-hit country , said it had confirmed 160 cases in 21 states . 
U.S. officials said they were encouraged by reports from Mexico that the outbreak may be leveling off , although they said it was too early to relax . 
`` We are remaining vigilant , '' said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
`` We have seen times where things appear to be getting better and then get worse again . 
... I think in Mexico we may be holding our breath for some time . '' 
Almost all infections outside Mexico have been mild . 
The only death in another country has been a Mexican toddler who was taken to the United States before he fell sick . 
President Barack Obama said the United States was responding aggressively to the new flu strain and was closing some schools temporarily and distributing antiviral drug supplies as needed . 
The White House said Obama spoke to Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday about U.S.-Mexican cooperation on limiting the spread of the virus . 
Scientists are still trying to assess how the new virus behaves and how it compares to regular seasonal flu strains , which kill between 250,000 and 500,000 globally every year . 
The outbreak remains tiny compared with other epidemics such as malaria , hepatitis and meningitis . 
But the WHO hiked its pandemic alert level to 5 from 3 this week -- the last step before a pandemic -- due to its rapid spread and the possibility it could hit hard in poor and disease-prone communities , including among people with HIV . 
Ryan said the WHO would send more than 2 million treatment courses of antiviral drugs to poor countries to help them prepare for the virus , which is already causing havoc with a travel industry that flies hundreds of thousands of people to and from Mexico each week . 
China suspended flights to Mexico after Hong Kong authorities on Friday confirmed a Mexican man who flew via the Chinese mainland was infected with the flu strain . 
Hong Kong was hit hard by the 2003 SARS outbreak . 
Police in surgical masks quarantined 200 guests and 100 staff inside a Hong Kong hotel where the Mexican , 25 , had been staying , saying they would be confined for a week . 
`` They said everybody needed to go back to their rooms . 
I do n't want to go to my room because I want to be out , '' an Australian man at the hotel told a TV reporter by telephone . 
Public hospitals in Mexico have noted a steady drop in patients turning up with fevers , suggesting the infection rate may be declining as people don face masks and use hand gel . 
Cordova said of 159 suspected flu deaths , tests showed 58 died of other causes . 
He said 16 deaths were confirmed as caused by the H1N1 flu and 85 were being tested . 
In Mexico City , big parks , museums and zoos were shut and in the sprawling metropolis of 20 million people many were heeding a government call to stay home for a prolonged five day-holiday to try to stem new infections . 
Jose Francisco Suarez , 15 , said he wanted to get back to school . 
`` We 're sick of this situation . 
A few days off school would n't be so bad but now there 's nothing to do , '' he said during a break playing basketball with two friends .

2009-05-02,"-LRB- For full coverage of the flu outbreak , click -LRB- nFLU -RRB- -RRB- HONG KONG , May 2 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Travellers quarantined in a Hong Kong hotel for a week after a Mexican guest tested positive for the H1N1 flu expressed dismay on Saturday at the tough steps , while an infectious disease expert said the authorities had over-reacted . 
Police wearing surgical masks sealed off the Metropark hotel on Friday night after test results on the 25-year-old Mexican man were confirmed , ordering approximately 200 guests and 100 staff to stay in the hotel for the next seven days . 
The measures taken by the authorities in Hong Kong underscore the concern here about the new flu and the confirmed case , Asia 's first . 
Hong Kong was badly hit by the SARS virus in 2003 and has had many episodes of H5N1 bird flu for more than a decade . 
Officials said no one would be allowed to leave the hotel in the Wanchai district , an area popular with tourists . 
`` They said everybody needed to go back to their rooms . 
I do n't want to go to my room because I want to be out , '' an Australian man in the hotel told local television by telephone . 
`` They told me I will stay here . 
I wo n't be allowed out and this is it . '' 
Brice Chevallereau , a French tourist , checked into the hotel on Friday afternoon but did not stay the night . 
When he returned to the hotel on Saturday , he was told by authorities he would have to be quarantined . 
`` Why do I have to go inside ? '' 
`` I just stayed two minutes in the lobby . 
It 's not fair . '' 
Journalists and camera crews massed on the street outside the hotel , which is being guarded by police and cordoned off with blue and white tape . 
Shops near the hotel were shuttered . 
`` How can there be business ? 
The police vans are all around here , '' said Li Mingtai , a waiter at a nearby restaurant . 
Twelve guests who had refused to stay were taken to a lodging house close to the border with mainland China . 
The site was used to quarantine Hong Kong people who were exposed to the SARS virus back in 2003 , a government spokesman said . 
PASSENGERS URGED TO COME FORWARD The Mexican man arrived in Hong Kong from Mexico on Thursday following a stopover in Shanghai . 
He developed a fever after arriving and took a taxi to a hospital on Thursday evening . 
He is in a stable condition , officials said . 
Authorities appealed for 142 passengers and crew on the same flight as the Mexican to report to health officials . 
Lo Wing-lok , an infectious disease expert , said the government was over-reacting . 
`` He would have been infectious starting from the time he was on the plane . 
Think about all the people around him on the plane , while he was going through customs , waiting for baggage , in the taxi , in the hotel and when he got to hospital , '' Lo said . 
`` So how can it be effective if the government is just trying to isolate people in the hotel , it is a mission impossible . '' 
Health officials said the `` essential needs '' of those inside the hotel would be looked after . 
They would also get regular medical check-ups and psychologists were on standby . 
An elderly couple passed a bag of clothes to police at the entrance for their daughter , who works in the hotel . 
The new virus , which is largely swine and part avian and human , has killed up to 101 people in Mexico , but confirmed cases in other countries have been mild . 
Nevertheless , news of the infected traveller caused jitters in Hong Kong and some people were taking no chances . 
In subways , ferry terminals and on the streets , more people went about their business on Saturday wearing surgical masks , although some had masks fashioned out of cloth . 
At the checkout counters in a supermarket , residents rifled through masks and sterilisers . 
A sign nearby said : `` Prevent flu infection . ''

2009-05-02,"Credit : Reuters\/Las Vegas Sun\/Steve Marcus LAS VEGAS | Sat May 2 , 2009 2:35 am BST LAS VEGAS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - About 25,000 British fans are expected to descend on Las Vegas for Ricky Hatton 's IBO light-welterweight title defense against Filipino Manny Pacquiao on Saturday , despite the global economic downturn . 
`` For Ricky Hatton to be able to bring 25,000 Brits to Las Vegas because he has a fight , even when most of them do n't have tickets , is incredible , '' promoter Bob Arum told Reuters on Friday . 
Around 4,500 fans crammed into the MGM Grand 's Garden Arena for Friday 's weigh-in while many more were turned away . 
`` It was probably the biggest weigh-in we 've ever had , '' said Richard Sturm , president of sports and entertainment for MGM Mirage . 
According to former middleweight and light-heavyweight champion Bernard Hopkins , the huge turnout gave further proof that boxing was still in excellent shape . 
`` Today showed that boxing is n't going anywhere , '' Hopkins told Reuters . 
`` The pay-per-view numbers are going to show , I believe , that boxing is alive as long as people are getting something they can be excited about . '' 
Hopkins , who is now a partner with Golden Boy Promotions who look after Hatton , said the struggling economy had placed an extra burden on organisers to produce competitive bouts . 
`` We 've got to take risks because now people are choosing wisely with their dollars , '' he said . 
`` They 're not going to buy tickets just because your name is Bernard Hopkins if you 're fighting Donald Duck . '' 
Boxing experts are eagerly anticipating Saturday 's 12-round bout because of its competitiveness and unpredictability . 
Although Pacquiao is widely regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world , he has never fought at light-welterweight where Hatton is unbeaten after 44 bouts . 
However Sturm said the popularity of the two fighters in their respective countries had been another significant factor in the fight 's huge interest . 
`` Both of these fighters have tremendous fan bases , '' he said . 
`` They 're icons and they both have the same number of fans . 
`` The British fans may be louder but Pacquiao has a fan base here -LRB- in the U.S. -RRB- that is n't all from the Philippines . 
He has a history of great fights in the States . '' 
Ultimately , Hopkins argued , the sport will withstand the economic downturn in the same way it has overcome previous obstacles . 
`` Boxing has survived the Depression , it survived the Mob , '' he said . 
`` It 'll survive everything , including the swine flu . ''

2009-05-03,"Mexico and China in swine flu row Mexico 's ambassador says he was denied access to citizens at a hotel A row is growing between Mexico and China over Beijing 's treatment of Mexicans traveling to China following the recent swine flu outbreak . 
Mexican officials said their citizens were being unfairly confined . 
The Mexican ambassador was denied access to a group being held at a Beijing hotel . 
China says the steps it has taken are lawful and justified . 
Some 400 people have been quarantined in China since the virus was confirmed in a man who arrived from Mexico . 
Most are in the Metropark hotel in Hong Kong , where the infected man checked in , but the number also includes his fellow passengers . 
No-one else has displayed any symptoms . 
Mexico has now confirmed 19 fatalities from the virus , but officials said it appeared that the outbreak could be levelling off . 
Mexicans are being held in hotels and other sites across China , including in Shanghai and Hong Kong . 
There are reports of international flyers being tested for the virus Ambassador Jorge Guajardo said many of them had no connection with the Shanghai-Hong Kong flight which carried the infected Mexican man . 
`` We are objecting to the fact that they are holding Mexicans in isolation for fear that they might have the flu virus , even though they have no signs of having the flu virus , '' he said . 
Mr Guajardo tried to visit 10 Mexicans quarantined in Beijing 's Guo Men hotel but was denied access by Chinese officials . 
On Saturday Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa criticised China , along with Peru , Argentina , Cuba and Ecuador , for cutting flights to Mexico . 
She also urged Mexicans to avoid travel to China , accusing its government of discrimination for the quarantine measures . 
Chinese Ministry of Health spokesman Mao Qunan said extra protection was needed after the virus reached Hong Kong . 
`` The confirmation of this case clearly raised the risks of A-H1N1 flu entering our country , '' he said , quoted by state media . 
He said the ministry had ordered for all those in `` close contact '' with the virus to be put under `` protective control '' .

2009-05-03,"Ministers face choice between stockpiling drugs to fight seasonal sickness and tackling new strain Barry Greatorex , of Chipping Sodbury , with wife Fran and son Jamie , has swine u . 
Photograph : Ben Birchall\/PA Ministers are facing a dilemma over their battle to combat swine flu . 
They will have to decide if Britain should cut back production of seasonal flu vaccines in order to allow pharmaceutical companies to concentrate on making a vaccine against the new virus . 
Such a move could have severe consequences . 
For the past eight years , seasonal vaccines have helped limit flu deaths , mostly among the elderly , to around 10,000 a year . 
But a switch to a new vaccine would force companies to stop making the seasonal vaccine . 
This could leave the country underprepared for outbreaks of standard flu later in the year and deaths could rise significantly . 
However , the alternative - a decision not to make a vaccine against swine flu - would put Britain at risk of a second wave of the new virus returning in a lethal form this winter . 
In the past , second waves of flu infections have caused widespread deaths after a first , relatively harmless wave has passed through the country . 
To date , only 15 non-lethal infections have been reported in Britain . 
`` Deciding to give priority for a new vaccine will be a judgment call , based on evidence we are now gathering about the swine flu virus 's behavior , '' said Professor David Salisbury , head of immunisation at the Department of Health . 
`` Pharmaceutical companies have only got a limited manufacturing capacity . 
So we will have to decide soon which way to go . 
At the moment , it looks likely that we will go ahead with a new vaccine . 
That means that this winter we will have some seasonal flu vaccine supplies and would also be ready should a second wave of swine flu appear . '' 
British scientists are studying virus samples sent to them by the US Centres for Disease Control on Thursday in the hope of understanding how it might behave in future . 
Early tests have suggested that the H1N1 virus passes fairly easily from person to person but has a low fatality rate . 
In particular , it lacks proteins - possessed by some strains - that would allow it to infect cells outside the body 's respiratory system , making it more dangerous . 
At the National Institute for Biological Standards Control -LRB- NIBSC -RRB- , in north London , researchers are also developing a candidate virus to form a vaccine against swine flu . 
`` We have injected viruses into hen 's eggs , where they will grow for two or three days before being extracted , '' said Dr James Robertson , a virologist . 
Then the virus will be broken open and its eight genes extracted and mixed with harmless laboratory flu strains to create a range of hybrid viruses . 
Researchers will then select one that possesses the right features for a future vaccine : a harmless virus that stimulates immune responses when injected into humans . 
Constructing this candidate virus vaccine will take around four weeks . 
Then scientists will pass it to pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline , which will manufacture the vaccine from it . 
The virus will be grown in hen 's eggs and then extracted . 
Proteins on their surfaces will be removed , mixed with chemical preservatives and a swine flu vaccine created . 
`` Coat proteins raise antibodies in the blood so that a person , coming across the real live virus , will be prepared to launch an immune attack against it , '' added Robertson . 
Creating supplies of the new vaccine will take an estimated four to six months . 
This would give time for UK ministers , acting under advice from Salisbury and colleagues , to give the go-ahead for vaccine production in three or four weeks ' time , allowing sufficient supplies to be ready by winter . 
In addition , the government faces the issue of deciding who would be treated as vaccine priorities . 
`` At the moment , we really do n't know who should get it first , '' said Dr Alan Hay , director of the World Influenza Centre , in north London . 
`` Normally we would propose giving it to the elderly . 
But in the case of the Mexican outbreak of this virus , those who succumbed were typically aged between 10 and 50 . '' 
Professor Salisbury told the Observer that the current advice of the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation was that health workers would still target the elderly , their carers , health service staff and those suffering from clinical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease . 
`` However , we will be ready to change those priorities rapidly if we have to , '' he added . 
He warned that health service staff would have to improve their attitude to flu vaccines in the event of a second outbreak of swine flu later this year . 
`` Only about 20 % take up offers of immunisation , compared with the elderly , who have a 70 to 75 % uptake . 
We can not allow that to continue . 
We are going to need to have all our doctors , nurses , ambulance drivers and other carers at work if there is a second serious outbreak later in the year and not at home in bed , sick . 
That means they will have to change their attitude to the vaccine . '' 
In fact , the best protection against the virus is available now , added Professor Peter Openshaw , director of the center for respiratory infection at Imperial College London . 
`` The virus is relatively harmless at present and the best possible protection against future , possibly more dangerous , infections would be an infection now . 
Just how you get that is a different matter . '' 
cents There are currently 15 confirmed cases of swine flu in Britain , 12 in England and three in Scotland , out of 631 suspected cases under investigation . 
cents Mexico yesterday revised downwards its suspected death toll from the disease from 176 to 101 . 
The health minister , Jos Angel Crdova , told the BBC that , based on samples tested , the mortality rate was comparable with that of seasonal flu . 
cents A total of 17 countries have now confirmed cases of swine flu within their borders , Denmark being the latest . 
cents Hong Kong has sealed a hotel with hundreds of tourists and employees inside as authorities try to prevent an outbreak of swine flu there . 
They are searching for all those who had contact with a Mexican tourist who brought the virus into the territory . 
"
2009-05-03,"Why have the numbers of deaths in Mexico changed ? 
Initial reports that 176 people had died from swine flu in Mexico were only suspected cases . 
The bodies would have been tested for the virus , which was not confirmed in all cases . 
Of the 101 suspected deaths from the virus in Mexico , 19 have been confirmed . 
Hospitals in the country have also noted a drop in patients appearing with fevers as officials think public health messages such as washing hands regularly must be getting through . 
There are 18 confirmed cases in the UK but health officials are certain this figure will rise in the coming days as further tests are completed on suspected cases . 
In the US , the second hardest-hit nation , 226 cases have been confirmed across 30 states . 
The World Health Organisation yesterday confirmed 787 H1N1 infections in 17 countries . 
The number of cases has been small but no one yet knows how far the H1N1 virus will spread , how it will mutate and how many people will be caught up in this first wave of infection . 
By raising its global alert status to level 5 , the WHO thinks that a pandemic is imminent . 
In that eventuality , the alert will be raised to level 6 , meaning the disease is spreading between people in a sustained way in more than two regions of the world . 
A pandemic is used by health officials to describe the geographical spread of a disease rather than its severity so , even if H1N1 became a pandemic , the number of cases could still be low . 
Should we worry about Tamiflu resistance ? 
All flu viruses mutate so , theoretically , a new version of H1N1 could become resistant to the UK 's frontline defense of Tamiflu . 
Doctors have been encouraged to prescribe Tamiflu only if absolutely necessary and patients will have to ensure they finish their courses . 
Will there be a winter wave of infections ? 
Though the number of cases outside Mexico has been relatively low , it could be because the flu season in the northern hemisphere is coming to an end as the weather warms up . 
The flu season in the southern hemisphere , however , is due to begin in a few months so if the H1N1 virus reaches countries there , it might circulate for several months , build up a number of infections , and then reappear in the northern hemisphere later in the year . 
Previous pandemics have behaved in this way , such as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , with a second or third wave returning months later to infect many more people than the milder first wave .

2009-05-03,"cents Jesus statue paraded around square to bring health A near-empty church in Mexico City . 
Photograph : Eitan Abramovich\/AFP\/Getty For Mexico 's Catholic church it is a tricky dilemma : how do you reach out to the faithful in a time of crisis if you are not supposed to touch them ? 
The flu epidemic has tapped the country 's deep religious sentiment , but to avoid spreading infection the church has had to suspend masses and discourage large gatherings of worshippers . 
`` It pains us a lot not to have mass on Sunday , but we have taken this decision in solidarity with the health authorities . 
They asked us to avoid having multitudes of people , '' said Diego Monroy Ponce , rector of Mexico City 's Basilica of Guadaloupe . 
In previous centuries , before science explained the transmission of germs , plagues had the one virtue from a clerical viewpoint of filling pews and coffers . 
Now , instead of harnessing anxiety for religious devotion and boosting its influence the church risks being sidelined . 
`` On weekends we would normally get 200,000 people here , '' lamented Monroy Ponce , gesturing to a basilica deserted save for a dozen priests on the altar singing hymns through surgical masks . 
On Friday , Mexicans were heartened by figures that showed the number of deaths and new infections stabilising . 
Fewer people wore masks , and children virtually invisible during the past week 's lockdown reappeared in some neighborhoods . 
But late yesterday the health minister , Jose Angel Cordova , dented optimism by saying 11 people were suspected to have died within 24 hours . 
The Catholic hierarchy , frustrated that it can not convoke large gatherings , has come up with several tactics to remain relevant . 
Cardinal Norbeto Rivera has written a prayer , which people can recite at home , asking for divine deliverance from swine flu . 
He urged people to follow religious services on radio and television . 
Pope Benedict XVI , speaking in Spanish to pilgrims at St Peter 's Square in Rome , urged Mexicans and others to keep praying for God to help them overcome their difficulties . 
The church 's ace , however , is a 17th-century statue , Jesus of Health . 
The six-foot replica of a bloodied messiah nailed to a cross is credited with banishing medieval plagues . 
Last week , for the first time in three centuries , it was removed from its chapel in Mexico City 's metropolitan cathedral and carried in procession around Zocalo Square . 
`` We took it out to ask for intercession in the epidemic , '' said Felipe Sanchez , a priest and cathedral spokesman . 
`` If things do not get better and it 's necessary to take it out for another procession , we will do it . '' 
Each day a few dozen people have defied warnings to stay indoors to see the statue . 
It has been placed just inside the cathedral entrance where there is plenty of ventilation . 
`` All Mexicans have to commend themselves to the Christ of Health because he helped us during plagues and epidemics in earlier eras , '' said Maria Granados Martinez , 59 , a widow . 
`` Those of us that have faith believe he could deliver us from that evil again . '' 
In New Zealand , which reported its first cases of the H1N1 virus last week , church authorities at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Wellington banned receiving the eucharist wafer on the tongue as well as drinking communion from a shared chalice and shaking hands at the sign of peace .

2009-05-03,"MEXICO CITY | Sun May 3 , 2009 7:36 pm EDT MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mexico announced on Sunday that its swine flu epidemic had passed the worst and experts said the new H1N1 virus might be no more severe than normal flu , although it could still impact on world health . 
Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said the flu was easing but warned that it was too early for Mexico -- the epicenter of an outbreak that has spread to 19 countries -- to let down its guard . 
The mayor of Mexico City , Marcelo Ebrard , said the capital of 20 million inhabitants was likely to resume normal activities on Thursday , observing certain health precautions , after a five-day partial shutdown to limit the virus ' spread . 
Cordova said the H1N1 flu outbreak appeared to have peaked in Mexico between April 23 and 28 and fewer people had gone to hospitals with serious flu symptoms in the past few days . 
`` The evolution of the epidemic is now in its phase of descent , '' he told a news conference in Mexico City , where millions of people heeded government advice to stay at home . 
After days of alarm that had kept streets eerily quiet , the atmosphere in Mexico City appeared more relaxed on Sunday , with some people venturing out on bikes or running . 
Many no longer wore the surgical masks that have been almost obligatory in the city in the last week as residents feared infection . 
But millions of Catholics stayed away from churches , watching Sunday mass on television instead . 
Mexican authorities have scaled back their estimate of deaths from the flu strain to over 100 , down from 176 . 
Only 19 deaths in Mexico are confirmed as being caused by the new flu . 
But new cases of the virus , which mixes swine , avian and human flu strains , still were being tracked across the world , keeping alive fears of the threat of a pandemic . 
The World Health Organization said its laboratories had identified a total of 898 H1N1 flu infections in 18 countries , including one case in Italy . 
Its toll lags national reports but is considered more scientifically secure . 
The flu has spread to 30 U.S. states and infected 226 people , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . 
It appears to be hitting mostly younger people , with very few cases reported in those over 50 years old . 
CDC acting director Richard Besser said there were `` encouraging signs '' that the new strain was not more severe than what would be seen during normal seasonal flu . 
But he still expected the virus to have a `` significant impact '' on people 's health . 
`` We 're not out of the woods , '' Besser told `` Fox News Sunday . '' 
The U.S. government said it hoped to have a vaccine ready for the new flu strain by the autumn . 
In Britain , Health Secretary Alan Johnson said the spread of the new flu strain had been contained there . 
A World Health Organization spokesman said in Geneva its emergency committee had no meeting scheduled to review its global alert for the H1N1 flu , which it set last week to 5 , one notch below pandemic level . 
Health officials and scientists from around the world have been focusing on how the new mutated , mongrel flu strain may be passed between animals and humans . 
The WHO said flu surveillance should be increased in both humans and animals now that the latest H1N1 strain was found to have infected pigs in Canada . 
Canadian health officials said a traveler carried the virus from Mexico to Canada and infected his family and a pig herd . 
Mexico has seen a stabilization of serious cases in the past few days , bringing some relief to its population , millions of whom have stayed indoors in line with a government order for non-essential businesses to remain closed through Wednesday . 
`` We 've been indoors since Friday . 
So now we 've come out to enjoy some fresh air , '' cyclist Silvia Rodriguez told Reuters , relaxing on the grass of a central park in Mexico City . 
Others were more wary . 
`` I 'm not totally convinced that the worst is over , '' said Juan Antonio Hernandez , 48 , a caretaker . 
A Mexican Embassy official in China said Chinese authorities were quarantining more than 50 Mexican business people and tourists after some showed flu symptoms . 
Asia 's trade and tourism could be hit by the latest flu outbreak but lessons learned from the SARS epidemic in 2003 would boost efforts to counter the effects . 
SARS , or severe acute respiratory syndrome , killed more than 800 people around the world in 2003 after first appearing in southern China . 
"
2009-05-03,"2009 05 3 08:53 JST MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mexico 's flu outbreak appeared to be stabilizing on Saturday but officials warned the unpredictable virus still threatened a global pandemic . 
Mexican officials said hospitals were seeing fewer new cases of people with symptoms from the new swine flu virus and cut the estimated death toll from the outbreak . 
`` It would still be imprudent to say that we 're past the worst of it but I do think ... we are in a stage of stabilization , '' Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told reporters . 
Costa Rica , Italy , and Ireland confirmed cases of the virus , which has now been found in 18 countries . 
In Geneva , the World Health Organization said H1N1 influenza had not spread in a sustained way outside North America , as would be required before the pandemic alert level is raised to its highest level . 
But it said that would probably happen soon . 
`` I would still propose that a pandemic is imminent because we are seeing the disease spread , '' Michael Ryan , WHO director of Global Alert and Response , told a briefing . 
Few are ready to take chances with the new virus , widely dubbed swine flu .

But not if your sport is ping pong and you are playing in the world table tennis finals in Yokohama . 
Players were undergoing thermographic imaging checks upon arrival at the venue following a local flu scare . 
Japanese organisers brought in the equipment , similar to machines used at the country 's major airports , after a schoolboy was admitted to hospital . 
The case proved to be a false alarm , but neighbouring South Korea has already confirmed its first case of the deadly new influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- strain , which has killed at least 100 people in Mexico . 
Players competing in the world table tennis championships were scanned for signs of increased body temperature , but one official admitted the technique had a potential flaw . 
Competitors do tend to get excited , Takashi Arakawa told Reuters .

2009-05-04,"Swine flu cases close UK school Another nine UK cases of swine flu have been confirmed taking the total to 27 , according to the Health Protection Agency . 
Five of the nine diagnosed with the H1N1 virus were year seven pupils from Alleyn 's School in Dulwich , south London . 
It is the fourth school to close . 
"
2009-05-04,"Parents say Alleyn 's School has everything under control Another nine UK cases of swine flu have been confirmed , taking the total to 27 , the Health Protection Agency has said . 
Five of those diagnosed with the H1N1 virus are year seven pupils at Alleyn 's School in Dulwich , London , which has announced it will close . 
All 1,200 pupils plus staff are receiving Tamiflu antiviral drugs . 
On Monday night , it emerged another school , Dolphin School in Battersea , London , had also been closed as a precaution - the fifth in the UK . 
A spokeswoman for NHS Wandsworth said that the two Dolphin pupils confirmed with swine flu were siblings of pupils at Alleyn 's . 
Since displaying symptoms , the pupils had not attended school . 
A message on the Dolphin School 's answering machine said : `` As a precautionary measure , the governors and senior team have decided to close the school for the next few days . 
`` You will be informed by the end of the week when children should return . 
If you or your family is unwell please contact your GP in the normal way . '' 
The two other new cases confirmed on Monday were adults who had visited Mexico . 
Alleyn 's , which is an independent school , has said it will be shut for at least seven days . 
Dr Ann Marie Connolly , director of public health at Southwark Primary Care Trust , said the symptoms were `` relatively mild '' and all five Alleyn 's pupils were responding well to treatment . 
She said the source of the outbreak was being investigated and all the contacts of each of the pupils were being offered antiviral treatment . 
Headmaster Colin Diggory is contacting exam boards to reschedule some exams , he said in a statement on the school website . 
A Department of Health spokesperson said seven of the nine new cases involved person-to-person contact . 
`` The arrangements in place across the UK are continuing to ensure that we are well-placed to deal with this new infection , '' the spokesman added . 
However , Health Secretary Alan Johnson told the BBC he expects a second , more serious , wave of cases later this year . 
It 's still like seasonal flu - and seasonal flu does kill There are now 23 cases in England and four in Scotland , the DoH said . 
The tally in London has reached 13 , according to NHS London . 
Swine flu has closed three other schools - South Hampstead High School in north west London , Downend in South Gloucestershire and Paignton Community and Sports College in Devon . 
Classrooms at South Hampstead have been closed until at least Thursday after a 14-year-old girl from Barnet in year nine was diagnosed with the virus . 
Antiviral drugs have been been offered to her year group and special arrangements are being made for upcoming exams . 
In a letter to parents on its website , the independent school said the girl was `` at home and well '' . 
An 11-year-old girl from south-west London who had visited the US as well as a man from Ayrshire are also amongst those who have contracted swine flu . 
The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- said the 11-year-old 's school will remain open as the child `` did not attend school while symptomatic '' . 
Several Britons are still under quarantine in a Hong Kong hotel after a guest there became China 's first confirmed case of swine flu . 
Eddie Sweeney and his wife Terry , from Buckinghamshire , checked into the Metropark Hotel on Thursday for two days but were told on Friday they and about 300 other guests would be confined to the building for a week . 
Mr Sweeney told BBC News : `` Effectively we 're in our rooms , apart from going to collect meals . 
Some of us are using the stairs as a way of exercise . 
Otherwise we 're confined . '' 
Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said there was one further probable swine flu case in Scotland , in addition to the four already confirmed . 
It involves a woman from Fife who traveled from Las Vegas to Edinburgh via London on 30 April . 
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader She said eight of the 10 people regarded as close contacts of the man from Ayrshire on flight BE7096 on 30 April had been traced , none of whom were showing any symptoms . 
He is thought to have picked up swine flu while in Texas and was diagnosed with the virus on Sunday . 
Cases have been confirmed in Newcastle , Oxfordshire , Devon , Merseyside , Worcestershire , Gloucestershire , as well as London and Central Scotland . 
A six-year-old girl in Oxfordshire diagnosed with the flu has made a full recovery , doctors have told the BBC . 
Health chiefs are awaiting the results of around 300 more tests . 
Environment Secretary Hilary Benn told GMTV the outbreak was less severe than first thought , but people should `` play safe '' . 
Two previous cases had seen Britons falling ill without having traveled to Mexico . 
Barry Greatorex , 43 , from South Gloucestershire , had been in contact with a traveller to the country . 
And Graeme Pacitti , of Falkirk , was infected through contact with the first British people to develop the flu . 
Information leaflets about how to reduce the chances of spreading infection are to be sent to people 's homes from Tuesday . 
Members of the public can call 08001513513 for recorded information about swine flu .

2009-05-04,"China has urged Mexico to handle the matter `` objectively and calmly '' China has denied it is discriminating against Mexican citizens in moves to stem the spread of swine flu . 
More than 100 people , including many Mexicans , have been quarantined in mainland China since the virus was found in a Mexican man in Hong Kong . 
Mexican officials said their citizens were being unfairly confined . 
No-one else has displayed any symptoms . 
China 's foreign ministry said the move was `` a purely medical quarantine issue '' and not an act of discrimination . 
Mexico should `` give full understanding to the measures adopted by China and handle this matter objectively and calmly '' , said a statement on the ministry 's website . 
The Mexican authorities say they are sending a plane to China to bring back those nationals who wish to return . 
Mexico has now confirmed 25 fatalities from the virus , but officials said it appeared that the outbreak could be levelling off . 
The a 25-year-old man diagnosed with H1N1 flew from Mexico to Shanghai to Hong Kong . 
After the positive test , China decided to track down everyone on his flight and put them into quarantine . 
It also isolated everyone in the traveller 's hotel in Hong Kong . 
Mexican officials say more than 70 Mexican citizens in China have been isolated . 
It is not yet clear whether or not these people had any contact with the infected traveller . 
About 50 are being held in quarantine in Shanghai in two five-star hotels , with 10 in Beijing . 
Mexican nationals are also being held in the city of Wenzhou . 
The BBC 's James Reynolds in Beijing says China 's actions are dramatic but the government may be trying to prove a point to its own people . 
In 2003 , the Communist Party was widely criticised for covering up the outbreak of the respiratory disease Sars . 
So , this time the government may want to show that it is capable of taking early , effective action - even if it leads to a bit of a row with a foreign government , our correspondent says . 
There are reports of international flyers being tested for the virus A spokeswoman at the Mexican Embassy in Beijing said the quarantined Mexicans were being treated well , but added the country 's ambassador to China had not been allowed to see those in Beijing 's Guomenlu Hotel . 
Ambassador Jorge Guajardo said many of them had no connection with the Shanghai-Hong Kong flight which carried the infected Mexican man . 
`` We are objecting to the fact that they are holding Mexicans in isolation for fear that they might have the flu virus , even though they have no signs of having the flu virus , '' he said . 
On Saturday Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa criticised China , along with Peru , Argentina , Cuba and Ecuador , for cutting flights to Mexico . 
She also urged Mexicans to avoid travel to China , accusing its government of discrimination for the quarantine measures .

2009-05-04,"Eateries in Mexico City have been restricted to offering takeaway food Restaurants and cafes in Mexico City are to reopen on Wednesday after the country recorded a fall in new cases of the swine flu virus . 
Libraries , museums and churches are to follow suit a day later but cinemas , theaters and bars are to remain closed , the mayor 's office said . 
Government officials are meeting to discuss when schools and businesses across the country can resume work . 
More than 1,000 cases of the virus have been reported in 20 countries . 
Confirmed cases in the US have risen from 226 to 286 , spread over 36 states , with most patients suffering mild symptoms . 
One death has been confirmed - that of a Mexican two-year-old boy who was visiting Texas . 
US : One death , 286 confirmed cases Netherlands , Switzerland , Austria , Denmark , Hong Kong , South Korea , Irish Republic , Costa Rica , Colombia , Portugal : 1 confirmed case Countries with confirmed cases of secondary transmission : Mexico , US , Canada , Spain , Germany , UK Officials say the rise in cases in recent days was due to results of lab tests coming through , rather than because of a new surge in cases . 
The UN says it has seen no evidence of a spread at community level in Europe and Asia - a development that would trigger the highest level of alert . 
Dr Keiji Fukuda , deputy chief of the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , told reporters it was essential that surveillance remained strong worldwide . 
Transmission to people who have not visited Mexico has been confirmed in six countries . 
The virus is suspected of claiming 101 lives in Mexico though the number of confirmed cases there is 26 , its health minister said on Monday . 
After Mexico accused China of unfairly quarantining some of its citizens , the two countries sent planes to pick up each other 's citizens . 
Canada 's confirmed number of cases rose to 140 Of nine new confirmed cases of swine flu in the UK , seven appear to have been acquired from people who had not been to Mexico ; total confirmed cases stood at 27 About 250 recruits and personnel at an army camp in the western Swiss canton of Fribourg were placed under quarantine after two recruits reported having flu symptoms Mexico 's shutdown is credited with stemming the spread of the virus but it badly affected the country 's economy . 
SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection President Felipe Calderon went on national TV on Sunday night to say a nationwide shutdown and an aggressive information campaign appeared to have helped curtail the outbreak in Mexico . 
`` We have succeeded in detaining or at least slowing the spread of the virus precisely because the measures have been the correct ones , '' he said . 
Swine flu has been confirmed as the cause of 26 deaths in Mexico and 701 people have been infected , Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said on Monday . 
Earlier , he had said the epidemic was `` in its phase of decline '' , having peaked between 23 and 28 April . 
Ban Ki-moon called for global co-ordination on swine flu Talking about the possible reopening of schools , he warned it would `` not happen just like that '' . 
`` There will have to be training , preparations for teachers and parents , '' he told reporters . 
Inhabitants of the capital interviewed by Reuters news agency on Sunday spoke of their frustration at the upset caused by the restrictions . 
`` They should open everything back up so we can work , '' said Alberto Vazquez , 28 , who washes cars for a living . 
`` These last days have been hard on us . 
If we do n't work , we do n't eat . '' 
Mexico has criticised China for placing in quarantine up to 70 Mexicans even though they showed no sign of having contracted swine flu . 
Mexico 's ambassador to Beijing helped deliver food for quarantined Mexicans A Mexican-chartered plane has left for Beijing to pick up Mexican citizens from different Chinese cities . 
China , which denies discrimination , sent a plane in the opposite direction to pick up 200 Chinese nationals stranded in Mexico City . 
A Mexican man staying in a Hong Kong hotel was confirmed to have contracted the virus on Friday . 
More than 250 guests and staff at the hotel are being held under quarantine for a week . 
Canada asked China for an explanation on Monday after it also quarantined a group of at least 20 Canadian students , none of whom had shown any flu symptoms , in the north-eastern town of Changchun . 
WHO chief Margaret Chan said there was `` no indication '' that swine flu , or H1N1 , might develop into a pandemic similar to the Spanish Flu which killed tens of millions at the end of World War I. Addressing a meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York by video link from Geneva , she also cautioned against complacency : `` Flu viruses are very unpredictable , very deceptive ... We should not be over-confident . 
One must not give H1N1 the opportunity to mix with other viruses . '' 
UN chief Ban Ki-moon , in New York , said the WHO did not plan to raise its pandemic alert to the highest level if the outbreak continued in its current pattern . 
The severity of the swine flu virus remains uncertain , the BBC 's Imogen Foulkes reports from Geneva . 
Health experts worldwide want to know which population groups are most vulnerable and why the virus has caused severe pneumonia among some patients , and diarrhoea - not normally associated with flu - in others , our correspondent says . 
On Tuesday the WHO will hold a meeting of doctors and scientists to discuss these questions . 
The answers , the WHO says , will help all those working to control and treat the virus . 
"
2009-05-04,"The head of the World Health Organisation , Margaret Chan , yesterday suggested the swine flu pandemic alert would eventually move to its highest level . 
But the woman in charge of the global fight against the H1N1 outbreak said a move to level six should not be taken as a cause for panic . 
`` Level six does not mean , in any way , that we are facing the end of the world . 
It is important to make this clear because -LRB- otherwise -RRB- when we announce level six it will cause unnecessary panic , '' she told Spain 's El Pa s newspaper . 
Officials from the United Nations and the WHO later insisted that there were no imminent plans to raise the alert level . 
But they agreed that going to the highest level could be an eventuality . 
Raising the alert level to six would mean that a global pandemic was in full effect . 
However , the officials emphasised that a pandemic did not necessarily mean the disease was particularly deadly . 
And in a video link with the UN , Chan appeared to attempt to allay fears , adding : `` We are not there yet . '' 
The Financial Times also reported that Chan , who recently raised the threat of a pandemic to level five , had suggested a move to level six was likely . 
She warned that the real blow might come if a second wave of cases swept across the globe at the start of the winter flu season . 
`` If it 's going to happen , it would be the biggest of all outbreaks the world has faced in the 21st century , '' she said . 
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , said : `` Let us remember that even if the WHO does declare phase six , a pandemic , that would be a statement about the geographic spread of the virus , not its severity . '' 
Spain remains the European country with the most cases of swine flu . 
By yesterday there were 54 reported cases , including four people who were infected in the country . 
The outbreak has raised concerns over its potential impact on tourism . 
"
2009-05-04,"I can still remember the precise moment when I finally realized what a chronic control freak I am . 
It was a Wednesday , and I was calmly designing the uniforms for my proposed global Reich on a computer , but the mouse would n't work properly , so I stood up and repeatedly smacked it against the wall like a tiny plastic coconut , screaming insults at God , decrying his intolerable insubordination and telling him he was fired . 
And a shard of shattered mouse hit me in the eye and set me blinking uncontrollably . 
I did n't like that . 
I do n't like `` uncontrollably '' . 
Lack of control is the core unifying characteristic of all the things I 'm afraid of . 
Air travel spooks me . 
Because I 'm not in control of the aircraft . 
Yes , cars are more dangerous , but if I imagine a car crash , at the back of my mind I can also picture myself opening the passenger door and leaping out , or grabbing the wheel at the last minute . 
It may be unrealistic , but it 's not entirely outside the realms of possibility . 
What can I do on a stalling plane ? 
Wish all the atoms in the ground away ? 
My long-standing phobias stem from a lack of control . 
My jitter-inducing emetophobia - fear of vomiting , thanks - stems from a terror of the stomach suddenly going freelance and ejecting its contents while I 'm trying to impress someone over dinner . 
Arachnophobia - well , spiders run in crazy patterns , do n't they ? 
And you ca n't tell what they 're thinking because their faces are so small . 
Thus they 're unpredictable . 
Thus , to my mind , dangerous . 
I have a niggling fear of heights , or more specifically , a niggling fear of hurling myself off one . 
A paranoid voice whispers that , hey , you might inexplicably go crazy and lob yourself over the ledge for a short-lived maniacal chuckle . 
Lack of control , once again , is the bogeyman . 
Recently I 've been away from this column because my arm started doing things beyond my control . 
It tingled up and down , as though de-materialising in an old episode of Star Trek . 
Some of its fingers went numb . 
Naturally I Googled these symptoms and discovered that , as far as Doctor Internet was concerned , I was nine seconds from death . 
I grew dizzy with fear . 
No control over my fate , see . 
Turns out it 's a herniated disc in my neck pressing against a nerve . 
It 'll heal slowly but surely . 
And if it gets worse , well , there 's stuff they can do . 
The continual discomfort is infuriating , but not the end of the world . 
Anyway , as part of the diagnostic process , I underwent several exotic tests - partly to rule out more sinister conditions , but mainly to gather more info on what was happening . 
One was a nerve conduction study , which basically involves passing an electric current through sections of your arm , hands , and wrist to measure what happens . 
It does n't hurt , but it 's super-creepy , because your fingers start doing things beyond your control . 
As a sort of finale , the doctor made my entire arm jump around of its own accord , like a wet fish flapping on a deck . 
No pain at all , but boy did it give me an existential shudder . 
Because I , like every one of us , in this push-button , automated world of instant results and comfort , have grown accustomed to the illusion of total control . 
And here was that control stripped clean away from me . 
Sadly , our magic controllable world is an illusion bearing little relation to the one we actually inhabit , where bad things sometimes occur for no reason . 
But rather than come to terms with it , we stubbornly refuse to accept the entire concept of risk , hence our neurotic hunt for the nearest scapegoat the moment anything goes wrong - or even looks as if it might . 
Having just finished a TV series that spent most of its time debunking news broadcasts , I 've been swamped with emails and Tweets saying , `` Ha ha - the news is really overdoing it on this whole swine flu thing , eh ? '' 
There 's a slightly hopeful tone to the queries , as though I 'm going to tell them everything 's going to be OK . 
But it 's not that simple . 
Yes , we 've seen bold headlines and chest-thumping graphics , but pandemic flu could turn out to be a serious threat , even if the symptoms seem mild at the time of writing . 
Sars and bird flu may have failed -LRB- so far -RRB- to become pandemics , but only because health professionals took the threat seriously . 
This here swine flu might mutate . 
It might grow fangs for all I know . 
It 's beyond our control . 
Blind fear is counter-productive , but so is blind denial . 
As with anything potentially risky , it 's best to know what to do in advance , in case swine flu turns nasty - just as it 's prudent to memorise the number 999 in case someone breaks into your house in the dead of night . 
There are aspects of any outbreak we can influence , if not entirely control . 
Chortle about growing trotters and a curly tail all you like , Captain Irony , but it might be a good idea to , y ' know , actually follow the medical advice by carrying tissues and developing a fairly studious hand-washing routine . 
Oh , and that 's proper 20-second hot-water-and-soap hand-washing , not that feeble imitation 99 % of people in public toilets perform , where they run a tap and waggle their hands vaguely near it for three seconds . 
You can catch this virus by touching , say , an infected doorhandle , then absent-mindedly wiping your eye five minutes later .

2009-05-04,"cents All but two of latest batch caught virus in Britain Monday 4 May 2009 10.22 BST Hotel staff and guests wave from inside the Hong Kong Metropark hotel , which is under swine flu quarantine . 
Photograph : AP Nine new cases of swine flu were confirmed in the UK today , leading to the closure of another London school . 
All but two had caught the infection in this country . 
Apart from one adult in the West Midlands , the other sufferers are all from London . 
The update brings the overall tally of confirmed cases in the UK to 27 , with more than 1,000 people infected worldwide . 
The latest school to be shut down is Alleyn 's , in Dulwich . 
A pupil at the fee-paying school who visited the US during the Easter holidays had already been diagnosed with swine flu . 
Now five more pupils , off sick on Friday , have been confirmed as having contracted the virus . 
The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- said the school would be closed for at least seven days . 
`` Those who are still unwell are receiving antiviral treatment and are recovering at home , '' a spokesman said . 
The school has arranged for all pupils and staff to be offered antiviral treatment tonight or tomorrow morning . 
A statement posted today on the school 's website by the headmaster , Colin Diggory , said he was aware the closure would cause `` particular concern '' to students due to take exams this week . 
Some of the tests may be rescheduled . 
Alleyn 's is the fourth UK school to be closed as a result of swine flu . 
Yesterday health officials announced that South Hampstead high school would be closed until Thursday on advice from the HPA . 
The infected pupil , a 14-year-old from Barnet , had come into contact with someone recently returned from Mexico . 
North of the border , the Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said that another `` probable '' swine flu case had emerged . 
A woman from Fife is thought to have contracted the H1N1 virus in Las Vegas before flying home on 30 April , and is now under voluntary quarantine and taking antiviral drugs . 
A close relative of the first Britons to catch the virus has been flown home from a North Sea oil rig as a precaution . 
The oil industry is distributing treatment kits , including antiviral drugs , to North Sea installations in case of an outbreak on a platform . 
In New York the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , insisted that the World Health Organisation did not plan to raise its pandemic alert to the highest level , six , if the current outbreak of a deadly new strain of flu continued at its present level . 
Addressing an informal session of the UN General Assembly , Ban said the World Health Organisation chief , Margaret Chan , had told him that `` if the situation remains as it is , WHO has no plan to raise the alert level to six at this moment '' . 
Chan , addressing the conference by videolink from Geneva , said the number of confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza reported to the WHO had risen to 1,003 from 20 countries . 
But she said there was `` no indication that we are facing a situation similar to that in 1918 '' , when a flu pandemic killed tens of millions . 
Six is the highest level on the WHO 's scale for the spread of a pandemic . 
Earlier the environment secretary , Hilary Benn , had said that swine flu appears to be `` relatively small and relatively mild '' and responds well to treatment . 
Urging the health authorities to remain vigilant , he remarked : `` It 's best to play safe . 
We are still not absolutely sure what it is that we are dealing with . '' 
The biggest worry was that the H1N1 virus could mutate , Benn said , and that a second wave of infections in the autumn could be more severe . 
Alan Johnson , the health secretary , said the spread of the H1N1 virus had largely been contained in the UK , though this might only last until the autumn . 
`` Our evidence from all previous pandemics is that you get two phases , '' he said . 
`` You get a first wave that is often very mild and then you get a much more serious wave that comes along in the autumn and the winter . '' 
There are 331 people currently undergoing tests for the virus across the UK . 
The officially confirmed global death toll deaths remain low at 26 . 
It includes include 25 in Mexico and one , a 21-month-old boy , in Texas . 
Hong Kong , criticised for delaying quarantine measures during the outbreak of Sars in 2003 , has sealed the central Metropark hotel , quarantining 350 guests and employees , after a Mexican tourist fell ill . 
The 25-year-old man had arrived in the territory on Thursday afternoon after a stopover in Shanghai and was said to be in a stable condition yesterday . 
Staff inside hung pieces of cloth in lobby windows , covering the pieces of paper reporters had stuck to the glass outside urging those inside to call them . 
Thomas Tsang , controller of Hong Kong 's center for health protection , said all those at the hotel were healthy . 
A British couple , Eddie and Terry Sweeney , who are quarantined inside the building , had only planned to stay in Hong Kong for two nights on the return journey from a visit to see their daughter , Sharon , who is a teacher in New Zealand . 
The couple , who have been married for 38 years , are stuck in their room for most of the day although they are allowed downstairs to collect meals . 
`` It could be a test of the marriage , '' joked Mr Sweeney , 62 , a retired Metropolitan Police officer from Hazlemere , Buckinghamshire . 
`` When you look out of the window and see the weather which is fantastic you think you should be on a beach . ''

2009-05-04,"Mexicans can start to relax a bit now that the country 's deadly flu virus appears to be under control . 
But the country 's health minister said on Sunday his countrymen should n't loosen their neckties , they should take them off altogether . 
Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova -LRB- pictured above with President Felipe Calderon last week ; Calderon is the one wearing a tie -RRB- was visibly relieved by new data showing a decline in the number of people severely ill with the new H1N1 flu virus . 
He ranted lightheartedly about germ-filled ties and bottom-pinching theater seats on Sunday as he issued new health safety guidelines for Mexicans preparing to return to work and school after a five-day shutdown . 
Citizens must continue to avoid physical contact , wash hands frequently and say goodbye to the tie , Cordova said . 
`` There is even a guideline -- and this is why you have n't seen us wearing ties -- it 's because the tie can harbor germs . 
We tend not to wash ties as often as other clothing and so all the microbes fall onto your tie when you sneeze and then we your ties falls into the soup and all over the place , '' he said . 
The moment of comic relief contrasted with the grave tone adopted at his previous , twice-daily press conferences to update reporters on the death toll from the new strain that has spread to 20 countries and infected just over 1,000 people worldwide . 
Mexicans have been forced to change their customs during the epidemic , to avoid spreading infection . 
The kiss on the check is out , rubbing elbows is in . 
The face mask has become a politically correct fashion statement , even if just left dangling around the neck . 
And bottles of antiseptic hand-washing gel are all ubiquitous . 
Journalists attending the minister 's press conferences dutifully hold out their hands so that security guards can administer a squirt of gel , a prerequisite for entry . 
Restaurants , movie theaters , schools and businesses have all been closed and are likely to reopen on Wednesday . 
But authorities do n't want Mexicans getting too close to each other just yet . 
`` The guidelines recommend that there be a minimum of two meters -LRB- six feet -RRB- between one person and another , '' Cordova said . 
`` For example in restaurants there should be unoccupied tables and distance between the diners . 
And the movie theaters might open but people wo n't be able to sit together , '' he said . 
`` There should be one person every four or five seats . 
Well , it depends on the size of the seats because sometimes you ca n't even fit in one , '' he complained . 
How seriously are Mexicans taking it all ? 
Many are skeptical of the politicians when it comes to explanations for the flu outbreak . 
But on the need to permanently change personal hygiene habits , its hard to argue . 
`` It would be great if we could keep this up forever , '' said Rodrigo Valdez , a taxi driver donning a mask and latex gloves but no tie . 
`` This might be the one good thing to come out of all this . ''

2009-05-04,"MEXICO CITY | Mon May 4 , 2009 3:56 pm EDT MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mexico will keep most of its schools closed until May 11 due to the flu outbreak that has killed at least 26 people in Mexico and raised fears of a pandemic in the rest of the world . 
The government had originally shut schools throughout the country until May 6 to avoid children catching the H1N1 swine flu virus but extended the shutdown , Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said on Monday . 
All schoolchildren up to the age of about 15 years old will stay off but older students will return on Thursday , he said .

2009-05-04,"DUBAI | Mon May 4 , 2009 8:25 am EDT DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Pharmacists in the United Arab Emirates have ignored regulations on the sale of Tamiflu to satisfy `` panic '' demand for the drug following a flu outbreak . 
`` We ran out of stock about a week ago . 
When the news came out about the cases in Mexico we had people flooding into the pharmacy asking for Tamiflu , '' one pharmacist said . 
Tamiflu is one of the medicines recognized by the World Health Organization as effective in treating the H1N1 flu that has spread across the world after an outbreak in Mexico . 
Ali Al-Marzouki , director of public health affairs in the UAE emirate of Dubai , said pharmacies had been reminded that Tamiflu should be sold only on prescription . 
`` We have to protect the stocks that we have now and we can not allow people 's panic to eat through our supplies , '' he said . 
`` There is no reason for people to panic , the UAE is safe . '' 
Pharmacies are selling a box of Tamiflu with 10 tablets meant to last five days for around 180 dirhams -LRB- $ 49 -RRB- . 
New stocks of Tamiflu and face masks are expected in a week , the pharmacist said . 
Monday , the World Heath Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said its laboratories have identified a total of 985 H1N1 flu infections in 20 countries , including 590 people infected in Mexico and 226 people in the United States . 
Marzouki said Dubai alone has 1 million Tamiflu capsules , imported four years ago during the avian flu outbreak . 
The UAE , most of whose population of 4.5 million are foreigners , is a commerce and tourism hub which has a large number of travelers transiting through its airports . 
`` The reason I want to buy Tamiflu is because I 'll be traveling to New York in two days and I 'm worried about the situation there , '' said a French businessman based in Dubai .

2009-05-04,"A boy wears a mask inside a bus in Bogota May 4 , 2009 . 
MADRID\/GENEVA | Mon May 4 , 2009 12:48 pm EDT MADRID\/GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organization is likely to raise its flu alert to the top of its six-point scale and declare a pandemic , its director-general indicated in an interview published on Monday . 
In remarks setting the scene for another alert increase , but without saying when , WHO chief Margaret Chan warned against over-confidence following a stabilization in the number of new cases of the H1N1 strain that has proved deadly in Mexico . 
`` Level 6 does not mean , in any way , that we are facing the end of the world . 
It is important to make this clear because -LRB- otherwise -RRB- when we announce level 6 it will cause an unnecessary panic , '' she told Spanish newspaper El Pais . 
`` Flu viruses are very unpredictable , very deceptive ... We should not be over-confident . 
One must not give H1N1 the opportunity to mix with other viruses . 
That is why we are on alert . '' 
The WHO 's pandemic phases reflect views about how a virus is spreading , and not how severe its effects are . 
Last week the United Nations agency raised the alert level twice , from 3 to the current 5 , in response to the sustained transmission of H1N1 in Mexico and the United States . 
Before issuing a level 6 alert , the WHO would need to see the virus spreading within communities in Europe or Asia . 
A declaration of a full pandemic would send a signal to governments worldwide to institute their pandemic response plans , which may include measures affecting hospitals , schools or public events . 
Phase 6 would also trigger increased support for developing countries which lack the drugs , diagnostic tests , and medical staff to respond appropriately to the flu that the WHO has said could be especially dangerous for people with HIV\/AIDS . 
While the top-level alert would not have an automatic effect on the world 's flu vaccine production , the WHO is expected to make an announcement alongside any such declaration to specify whether manufacturers should switch from making seasonal to pandemic flu vaccines . 
In her remarks to El Pais , Chan said that weather patterns could play an important role in how the flu continues to spread . 
The southern hemisphere is about to enter winter , when seasonal flu cases normally spike , the infectious disease expert said . 
`` We have to be very careful . 
No one can predict what is going to happen when countries in the south have flu peaks and this new one arrives -- which it is going to do , without a doubt , '' she said . 
On Sunday , a WHO spokesman said the relatively large number of infections in Spain of what has been commonly known as swine flu -- at 40 , according to the WHO 's count -- seemed to be mainly `` imported '' cases involving people returning from Mexico , the epicenter of the disease outbreak . 
Chan echoed this and said that so far , there were not many flu patients in Europe that have not been to Mexico or had direct contact with those who had . 
`` It is true that the number is small , but because of that I would say that we have not seen the full situation or the whole picture of what is happening . 
The situation is evolving and the virus is changing , '' she said . 
Chan , who fought SARS and bird flu in her previous job as Hong Kong 's health director , said it was too early to predict what proportion of the population would catch the new flu strain after the European Union predicted 40 percent of the population would become infected .

2009-05-04,"NUSA DUA , Indonesia | Mon May 4 , 2009 6:47 am EDT NUSA DUA , Indonesia -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The global downturn could lead to unrest , more poverty and environmental challenges in Asia , regional leaders were warned on Monday , after they agreed on a $ 120 billion emergency fund to counter the crisis . 
Asia has been hard hit by the collapse in global demand largely because of the region 's heavy reliance on exports . 
Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan and Japan are in recession and growth elsewhere is the weakest in years . 
`` Poverty is worsening in many countries . 
The extremely urgent climate change agenda could be affected , '' Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said at the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank . 
`` If all this goes unchecked , down the road we could see social and political unrest in many countries , '' he told representatives of the ADB 's 67-member countries , including finance ministers and central bank governors . 
To counter the downturn , the ADB said it will raise lending by half and Asian governments agreed at the weekend to launch a $ 120 billion fund countries can tap to avert a balance of payments crisis . 
Japanese Finance Minister Kaoru Yosano warned that private capital flows into Asian developing nations could turn negative in 2009 after falling below $ 100 billion in 2008 from over $ 300 billion in 2007 . 
`` ADB should play a leading role to cushion the impact of such a brutal reversal in capital flows , '' he told the meeting , adding though that a resurgence in Asia could trigger a global recovery . 
Longer term , it was vital for emerging Asian economies to build domestic demand to counter the reliance on export earnings , ADB delegates said . 
Many Asian exporters have seen demand for their products halve from a year earlier as the deepest global downturn in decades hammered world trade . 
`` The Chinese government 's basic approach is to expand domestic demand , particularly consumer demand , to promote growth , '' Finance Minister Xie Xuren said . 
Karen Mathiasen , the chief U.S. delegate , said the shift to rely more on domestic demand would be profound . 
`` Such a fundamental economic transformation will not be easily or rapidly attainable , but ultimately will be key to underpinning a healthy , global and balanced recovery . '' 
To achieve this goal , ADB Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Asia needed to channel more savings into investments and consumption . 
`` They need to spend more on health , education and social security to reduce household needs for precautionary savings . 
They need strategies to transfer more corporate savings to households to encourage greater consumer spending . '' 
The ADB has forecast that the region 's economies are likely to grow just 3.4 percent in 2009 , the slowest pace since the Asian financial crisis a decade ago . 
It sees growth recovering to 6.3 percent next year if demand rebounds . 
But transforming household savings into consumer spending and investments has been a difficult task for Asian policymakers . 
In the 10 Southeast Asian or ASEAN nations -- Brunei , Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam -- savings exceed investments by at least 10 percent , ratings agency Standard and Poor 's says . 
The ADB is meeting on the Indonesian resort island of Bali , where finance ministers from China , Japan , South Korea and ASEAN on Sunday set up a $ 120 billion emergency fund aimed at countering the sort of capital flight seen during the 1997\/98 Asian financial crisis . 
It is Asia 's first independently managed multilateral liquidity facility and will be launched by the end of the year . 
Japan , the region 's biggest economy , also announced a plan to supply up to 6 trillion yen -LRB- $ 61.54 billion -RRB- to support its neighbors in an economic downturn . 
Several Asian policy makers have flagged the risk of social unrest if governments fail to deal with the crisis . 
Chinese officials have warned economic discontent could threaten social stability as the giant economy 's growth dropped below double digits for the first time in years . 
And during the last crisis a decade ago , Indonesia 's long-term president , Suharto , stepped down after street protests . 
Governments also changed in South Korea and Thailand . 
To counter the current crisis , the ADB plans to ramp up lending to its developing members to about $ 33 billion in 2009 and 2010 , almost a 50 percent increase over 2007-2008 . 
Most of the new loans will be for infrastructure . 
If approved , the bank will also create a $ 3 billion fast-disbursing facility to meet `` urgent needs , '' Kuroda said .

2009-05-05,"Masked medical staff escorted the Mexicans into ambulances Dozens of Mexicans quarantined in China because of fears they may be infected with swine flu are being flown home on a specially-chartered Mexican plane . 
About 70 Mexicans were confined despite just one confirmed case of the virus . 
The issue sparked a diplomatic row , with Mexico accusing China of targeting its citizens unfairly , and Beijing saying it was a `` purely medical '' issue . 
Some 26 people have died of the virus in Mexico and more than 1,000 cases have been reported in 20 countries . 
But just one fatality has been recorded outside Mexico - a two-year-old Mexican boy who died in the US while on a visit . 
Mexico now puts the number of infections within its borders at 840 . 
The World Health Organization says 1,490 people around the world have so far contracted the H1N1 swine flu virus . 
However , WHO figures often lag behind those announced by national government laboratories In the UK , delivery begins of specially-produced leaflets offering advice on swine flu and advice on how to prevent its spread South Korea reports its second confirmed case of swine flu , the first instance of human-to-human transmission in Asia . 
The charter plane taking Mexicans out of China landed in Shanghai on Tuesday at about 1300 local time -LRB- 0500 GMT -RRB- to pick up the first group of quarantined Mexicans . 
US : One death , 403 confirmed cases Masked medical staff then escorted the Mexicans into ambulances to take them to the airport , before they cleared immigration and customs at a temporary outdoor facility . 
The flight then continued on to Beijing , Guangzhou and Hong Kong before returning to Mexico City . 
The quarantine row between Mexico and China developed after a 25-year-old man who had flown from Mexico to Shanghai and Hong Kong was diagnosed with swine flu - or H1N1 . 
Mexican officials said more than 70 of their citizens in China were confined . 
It is not yet clear whether or not these people had any contact with the infected traveller . 
About 50 were being held in Shanghai in two five-star hotels , with 10 in Beijing and several more in the city of Wenzhou . 
Masked Chinese set up a temporary immigration post for the Mexicans China decided to track down everyone who landed on the same flight as the infected man and put them into quarantine . 
It also isolated everyone in the traveller 's hotel in Hong Kong . 
In Beijing , Yu Debin , deputy director of the Beijing Tourism Bureau insisted that those kept in the Guomen were treated `` very well '' . 
They had been given `` luxurious '' rooms complete with flowers , fruit , and toys for children to play with . 
A `` special menu '' was prepared to ensure the guests ate well , Mr Yu said . 
However , one traveller quarantined in Beijing told Mexican radio that soldiers were guarding the hotel gates . 
`` This is like a kidnapping for us , '' Mirna Elisa Berlanga said , while Mexico has issued strongly-worded statements over the past few days condemning Beijing 's response . 
Meanwhile , another diplomatic row could be brewing after Canada asked China to explain why a group of at least 20 Canadian students had been quarantined in the north-eastern town of Changchun . 
Canada said none of the students had shown any flu symptoms . 
The US embassy said on Tuesday that four American citizens had also been quarantined in China due to swine flu fears . 
Speaking on Mexican TV late on Monday evening President Felipe Calderon praised the country 's precautions against swine flu and said children would soon begin returning to schools closed at the height of the scare . 
Chinese authorities are taking no risks with the quarantined Mexicans Large parts of Mexico 's economy have been shut down since 1 May in an effort to stem the spread of the virus . 
`` Thousands of lives have been saved not only in Mexico but in the world , '' Mr Calderon said . 
Hailing the `` energy '' with which Mexicans tackled the previously-unknown virus , Mr Calderon said the nation 's `` enormous effort '' was helping the country avoid a major tragedy . 
`` The number of deaths recorded has notably decreased , and the numbers of cases of people infected with the virus has also reduced . '' 
Pupils without symptoms of flu will begin returning to school on 7 May , the president said , adding that school buildings would also undergo a deep clean to limit chances of contamination . 
Mexico will also begin a worldwide effort to repair the nation 's tarnished international image in the hope of convincing tourists from around the world to continue visiting Mexico , including reducing entry and exit taxes for tourists .

Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon told a press conference that no health minister could ignore World Health Organisation warnings about the possible impact of a flu pandemic . 
`` It 's absolutely right that we prepare for the worst here , that 's what we 've been doing - not that we 're necessarily expecting the worst , but we are preparing for that because it 's the right and responsible thing to do , '' she said . 
Cases of the virus have been confirmed in Newcastle , Oxfordshire , Devon , Merseyside , Worcestershire , Gloucestershire , as well as London and Central Scotland . 
A six-year-old girl in Oxfordshire diagnosed with the flu has made a full recovery , doctors have told the BBC .

2009-05-05,"Advert warns about the dangers of swine flu It is too early to assume the swine flu outbreak is a mild infection just because no-one in the UK has died , England 's chief medical officer says . 
Sir Liam Donaldson warned against complacency because flu viruses could change character `` very rapidly '' . 
A new case of the H1N1 virus in England has taken the confirmed UK total to 28 , the Department of Health said . 
Leaflets suggesting ways people can treat and prevent catching swine flu have begun dropping through doors . 
We must not be complacent . 
We know that flu viruses can change their character very rapidly as they move through populations Sir Liam , who updated the government 's weekly cabinet meeting on the flu situation , told BBC News : `` We may see an apparent peak in the incidents over the next month or so , but that does n't mean it 's gone away . 
`` It could be that we 'll see a resurgence of the virus in the autumn and winter when the normal flu season starts . 
`` We must not be complacent . 
We know that flu viruses can change their character very rapidly as they move through populations . '' 
He added : `` These next few months are vitally important in understanding what sort of virus we 're dealing with . '' 
The latest case of swine flu , confirmed on Tuesday , was in an adult from the Slough area of Berkshire , the South Central Strategic Health Authority said . 
The individual , who is associated with travel to Mexico , is responding well to antiviral drugs , the authority added . 
It brings the overall totals to 24 in England and four in Scotland . 
A spokesman said : `` It is right that we are preparing for the possibility of a global pandemic . 
`` The UK 's arrangements are continuing to ensure that we are well-placed to deal with this new infection . '' 
Five UK schools hit by the virus have begun rescheduling GCSEs and A-levels as the summer exam season begins .

Four are secondary schools . 
The latest to be hit by the virus is Alleyn 's School in Dulwich , London , where five year-seven pupils were diagnosed on Monday . 
A sixth pupil from the independent school , who visited the US during the Easter holidays , was diagnosed with the virus on Sunday . 
The school said it was rescheduling A-level exams in art , biology and foreign languages for next week . 
In a statement it said : `` In line with procedure , the school will be writing to the examination boards who are always sympathetic to students in these circumstances . '' 
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Nine out of 10 of the parents had now collected the Tamiflu anti-viral medication offered by the Health Protection Agency , the school added . 
More than 1,200 private schools have been given legal advice by the Independent Schools Council , which suggests setting up `` quarantine rooms '' for pupils suspected of having the virus . 
It also says schools should provide a policy on what to do in case of a pandemic . 
Governors at Dolphin School in Battersea , London , closed its doors as a precaution after it emerged that two pupils - siblings of pupils at Alleyn 's - had been confirmed with the virus .

2009-05-05,"Swine flu plan to award GCSEs without exam Exam boards may base grades on coursework alone if virus stops tests Tuesday 5 May 2009 21.31 BST Exam boards are working on contingency plans to award children GCSE and A-level grades based on coursework marks if they are unable to attend an exam because of swine flu , the schools minister , Jim Knight , has revealed . 
Five schools and a nursery have now closed after children were diagnosed with the H1N1 virus and some have had to urgently reschedule practical tests for art and music GCSEs scheduled for this week . 
There are now fears for the Sats tests , due to be taken by 600,000 11-year olds next week , and the GCSE and A-level exams , which are scheduled to run through to the end of June . 
John Dunford , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said : `` Schools are extremely worried about the exams , GCSEs , AS and A-levels . 
They need to know what to do if one of the pupils or staff is ill . 
They want to know what the contingency plans are for external examinations . '' 
One further person , an adult living in the south-east who has returned from Mexico , was confirmed to have swine flu by the Health Protection Agency today , bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 28 , with 333 still under investigation . 
Knight said exam boards were considering new contingency plans but urged schools not to panic and rush to close unless they had received specific advice from the HPA . 
It comes after one school , Dolphin school in Battersea , south London and its nursery , closed without taking advice from the HPA . 
Knight said : `` I would be surprised if schools were to unilaterally decide to close without consulting the Health Protection Agency , who are experts in this matter . 
`` I do n't advocate schools doing anything without reference to the HPA . 
The HPA has been thorough and professional in advice to schools on swine flu . 
Heads have a legal responsibility to make sure their children and staff are safe at school . 
I would encourage schools to take advice from the HPA before they make the decision to close . '' 
He revealed that the exam boards were looking at expanding the system of giving `` special consideration '' to pupils who are sick at the time of their exams . 
Under the system , GCSEs , A-levels and other qualifications can be awarded on the basis of coursework grades and marks from modules already sat . 
Knight said : `` There are already procedures in place if candidates ca n't sit their exams and are given special consideration . 
That can be put into action if things get worse . 
In contingency terms all these things are being discussed by exam boards . '' 
Other options include looking at how pupils can sit exams in isolation even if a school is closed . 
The exams watchdog , Ofqual , said : `` We are looking again at contingency plans to take coordinated action for the exam season if needed . '' 
The exam boards are due to meet on Thursday to discuss the situation as it unfolds . 
Private schools have been issued with guidance advising them to expand their medical facilities to `` quarantine '' any infected pupils . 
The HPA said it was not advising the same to all schools . 
It does not advise schools to close automatically as soon as a pupil is diagnosed with swine flu , but recommends a risk assessment to see if is is possible to limit the disruption to other children 's education . 
Most schools affrected have called in the local authority 's health protection unit to help them decide whether to shut their doors . 
`` All the schools that have closed did close on the advice of the health protection unit , apart from the Dolphin schools , where the board of governors made the decision to do so , '' the HPA said . 
Though cases of swine flu have so far been mild in the UK , the HPA says it must be treated differently from seasonal flu . 
`` Although it would be unusual to close a school in response to a single case of flu , in the light of evidence emerging that swine influenza can spread rapidly in the school setting , it is recommended that , if a probable or confirmed case of swine flu occurs in a school setting , consideration should be given to closing the school temporarily -LRB- initially for a period of seven days -RRB- , '' the HPA guidance says . 
Key to the decision to close is how easily the flu could spread . 
Staff should consider how long any sick child has been in school , for instance , and whether classes or year groups intermingle and all eat together . 
No such precautions are recommended for offices and workplaces . 
The HPA said schools were a special case because children play together and are frequently in close physical contact . 
If an office worker gets swine flu , public health officials will trace his or her close contacts , who will include work colleagues . 
Only those who have been working within one metre of the affected person for an hour or more are considered sufficiently at risk to be given antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu , which can prevent them falling sick . 
Tonight one flu expert warned that the UK 's much-lauded drug stockpile might not be enough if people in contact with flu are given drugs , as children in UK schools have been . 
Dr John McConnell , editor of the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal , said in an online comment in the Lancet that 16 times as much antiviral medicine is needed to prevent illness as to treat people . 
`` By this measure , the UK has stockpiles of oseltamivir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- sufficient to treat 30 million people -LRB- about half the population -RRB- but to prevent infection in only 1.9 million , '' he said .

2009-05-05,"Five schools shut because of swine flu GCSE and A-level exams rescheduled as schools in London and south-west close to prevent virus spread Tuesday 5 May 2009 14.37 BST Governors at Dolphin school in Battersea decided to shut its doors as a precaution after two of its pupils were confirmed with the virus .

Five schools in England are now closed after pupils fell ill with the virus . 
Three of them are private schools and all but one are secondary schools . 
Alleyn 's school in Dulwich , south-east London , closed when six pupils were confirmed with having the H1N1 virus yesterday . 
The school expects to be closed until at least Sunday . 
A statement on the school 's website said teachers were drawing up contingency plans for exams this week when students were due to sit A-level art exams and language oral tests . 
All parents and staff were given a one-to-one medical consultation with GPs and nurses and offered the antiviral medication Tamiflu for their children . 
Paignton community and sports college in Devon was one of the first to close after a 12-year-old girl contracted the virus after a holiday in Mexico . 
The school said it was asking exam boards to give its GCSE and A-level pupils `` special consideration '' because of the loss of six and a half days of lessons and `` the anxiety and stress our pupils are under '' . 
Downend school , in south Gloucestershire , will be closed this week after a 12-year-old was confirmed to have the virus . 
The school said it would be making arrangements for a `` deep clean '' and hoped to open again next week . 
Tamryn Savage , the school 's headteacher , said : `` We are working closely with the awarding bodies to make alternative arrangements . '' 
South Hampstead high school in north-west London shut after a 14-year-old was diagnosed with swine flu . 
It will re-open on Thursday and has offered all year 9 pupils medication . 
Jenny Stephen , the school 's headteacher , said : `` Unfortunately large school events need to be canceled , but special arrangements are being made to accommodate GCSE and A-level exams . 
The important message is that any students who have any symptoms of a flu-like illness must not attend school and will be turned away . '' 
Two pupils who are siblings at the Dolphin school in Battersea , south London , fell ill with the virus leading the school to close . 
More than 1,200 private schools have been told to consider setting up `` quarantine rooms '' for pupils suspected of having the virus . 
The Independent Schools Council 's lawyers , Veale Wasbrough , also told the schools that they did not have to refund fees if a school was affected . 
The Joint Council for Qualifications , the umbrella group for exam boards , said examiners would take into consideration pupils who did not sit exams because of the swine flu . 
Mock exam papers may be used if a student had completed under half of their assessments for A-levels and under 35 % for GCSE . 
But `` the awarding body would need more than just the mark achieved by the student in the examination , '' the JCQ said . 
`` It would need to have the candidate 's scripts and a copy of the examination paper . 
Senior examiners would evaluate the adherence of the mock examination paper to the specification requirements . 
If the mock examination paper meets the demands of the specification and its assessment objectives , then the marks can be taken into consideration . '' 
At the Department of Health 's last count there were 27 confirmed cases in the UK 23 in England and four in Scotland . 
The government 's swine flu information line is 08001513513 .

Is it safe to travel ? 
In a statement on 1 May , the WHO said : `` Limiting travel and imposing travel restrictions would have very little effect on stopping the virus from spreading , but would be highly disruptive to the global community . '' 
`` Regarding the risk of being infected by an influenza virus , travellers are advised , whenever possible , to avoid crowded enclosed spaces and close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections .

2009-05-05,"cents Kathleen Sebelius ` optimistic ' about virus threat cents UK confirms new case of swine flu Tuesday 5 May 2009 17.04 BST The swine flu leaflet to be distributed to UK households . 
Photograph : Tim Ireland\/PA The swine flu virus could turn out to be less severe than previously feared , the US government said today , as one more new case of the outbreak was confirmed in the UK . 
Kathleen Sebelius , making her first speech as the US health secretary , said : `` We are cautiously optimistic that what we are seeing right now is presenting itself as a much milder virus than the initial cases that presented themselves in Mexico . '' 
There are 403 confirmed cases of swine flu in the US , and so far one death . 
The British government 's chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , today warned it would be `` premature '' to assume the virus was a mild infection . 
His comments came as the World Health Organisation said it had started to distribute 2.4 m treatments of antiviral drugs to 72 countries `` most in need '' . 
It declined to name the countries but confirmed that they included Mexico , which has been hardest hit by the outbreak with 590 laboratory-confirmed cases and 25 deaths , according to WHO figures . 
Donaldson predicted that a second , larger wave of infections could be expected during the usual flu season in the autumn and winter . 
Health officials today announced one more confirmed case of swine flu in Britain , taking the national total to 28 . 
The unnamed patient , from south-east England , had traveled to Mexico . 
Every household in the UK has been sent a leaflet advising how to prevent the spread of the virus , in what is the biggest public health campaign since the 1980s . 
The leaflets suggest ways in which people can reduce their chances of catching swine flu and gives advice on what they should do if they develop symptoms . 
Donaldson said officials were closely monitoring the progress of swine flu in southern hemisphere countries such as Australia and New Zealand , which are in winter . 
This week , five year seven pupils at Alleyn 's school in Dulwich , south-east London , tested positive for the virus . 
The school will close for a week on Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- advice . 
The five had come into contact with a pupil who had recently returned from the US and was diagnosed with the virus at the weekend . 
All of the new patients are recovering well at home . 
`` Our advice is : please do n't panic , '' said Antony Faccinello , the senior deputy head at the school . 
`` Parents should keep reading our website for advice , and stick to that advice . 
We want them to come in to the school to collect their child 's preventative dose of Tamiflu . '' 
Alleyn 's shares facilities , including buses , with at least two other schools , James Allen 's girls ' school and Dulwich College . 
The HPA said about 1,200 people , including Alleyn 's pupils and staff , would be offered the antiviral treatment . 
A course of Tamiflu involves a pill a day for 10 days , but younger children will be given smaller amounts . 
Donaldson said there was no need for the public to stock up on antiviral drugs . 
Asked on BBC Radio 4 's Today program whether people should buy Tamiflu over the internet , he said : `` No , they should not . 
We have a very large stockpile of antiviral drugs the largest in the world . '' 
Commenting on accounts from some swine flu victims who had suggested the virus was no more severe than a cold , he said : `` At the moment we do n't know enough about this virus to draw any conclusions about its severity . 
There have been deaths in Mexico it is premature to conclude that is a mild infection . '' 
In addition to the five Alleyn 's cases , two further children siblings who came into contact with a separate confirmed case in London were confirmed as being infected . 
Yesterday their school , the Dolphin school in Battersea , south-west London , said it would be closed for a few days as a precautionary measure . 
Over the weekend independent schools were issued with advice about what to do in the case of a pandemic , mirroring that already supplied to state schools . 
They are advised to set up text message systems to inform parents of school closures , and web access for pupils to work from home if necessary . 
The advice , drawn up by lawyers for the Independent Schools Council , says : `` Consider whether extra space will be required for effective quarantine of suspected victims . '' 
Melvyn Roffe , chairman of the Boarding Schools ' Association , said the organization had been in daily contact with government officials monitoring the potential for an outbreak among boarding pupils . 
`` We are stocking up on cleaning equipment and making contingency plans , '' he said . 
Later this week the exams watchdog , Ofqual , and the Qualification and Curriculum Authority will meet exam boards and representatives from the Department for Children , Schools and Families -LRB- DCSF -RRB- and the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly to discuss this year 's exams . 
Next week 's Sats tests are expected to go ahead as planned in primary schools . 
A-level and GCSE exams are scheduled from now into June . 
Another suspected case of H1N1 came to light in Scotland , the fifth in eight days . 
A traveller from Fife , thought to have contracted the virus in Las Vegas , is under voluntary quarantine . 
Scottish officials were investigating another probable case involving a 21-year-old woman from Grampian who recently traveled to New York . 
Nicola Sturgeon , the Scottish health secretary , said further cases were still likely but said the virus appeared to be far less virulent than first feared . 
`` I remain optimistic that our containment strategy at this stage has proved successful , '' she said today . 
Sturgeon also criticised a decision by the Russian government to ban pork imports because of the outbreak . 
`` There 's absolutely not a shred of evidence whatsoever that pork products are n't entirely safe , '' she said . 
`` We 've been operating on the precautionary principle but also in a way which is proportionate , and I would n't think that action was proportionate . '' 
Scotland 's chief medical officer , Dr Harry Burns , said the UK 's veterinary authorities were clear that flu in pigs was mild and `` self-limiting '' and was not a cause for human concern . 
H1N1 had come from a combination of swine , avian and human strains . 
`` There 's absolutely no evidence you can contract influenza from infected pigs , '' he said . 
Health authorities issued an alert for passengers on board a FlyBe short-haul flight from Birmingham to Glasgow on 30 April after a man from Ayrshire and Arran fell ill . 
The man tested positive for swine flu and is being treated at home . 
A relative of the first Britons to catch the virus , Iain and Dawn Askham , from Polmont , near Edinburgh , has been flown home from a North Sea oil rig as a precaution . 
He is not showing any symptoms , and is not among the 19 other `` possible '' cases in Scotland . 
According to the WHO , 21 countries had officially reported 1,085 cases of H1N1 infection . 
China has forced dozens of Mexican nationals in quarantine , with a plane being sent to take them home , while Chinese nationals prepared to leave Mexico .

2009-05-05,"CDC Recommends Flocked Swabs and Copan-Manufactured Viral Transport Media for Collection ... \* Reuters is not responsible for the content in this press release . 
As the situation with the novel H1N1 -LRB- Swine Flu -RRB- virus continues to evolve , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- continue to update their document Interim Guidance on Specimen Collection and Processing for Patients with Suspected Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- Virus . 
The objective of this document is to provide guidance on appropriate specimen collection , storage , processing , and testing for patients with suspected swine-origin influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus infection . 
One of the most widely used methods for detection of H1N1 flu virus is to collect a nasopharyngeal swab sample . 
The CDC recommends the use of synthetic tip swabs , such as Flocked Swabs , which exhibit a superior recovery of viruses . 
Several independent scientific studies published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology and presented at Clinical Virology Symposium show that the quality of the sample taken using Copan Flocked Swabs is comparable to the quality of a sample collected from a nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasal was , which are considered the gold standard for upper respiratory virus samples . 
The open structure of Copan Flocked Swabs acts like a soft brush that efficiently dislodges and collects cells and mucus , then releases the sample immediately when put in a viral transport medium . 
In Ontario , the Agency for Health Protection and Promotion also lists Flocked Swabs as the preferred type of swab for respiratory virus sample collection on its latest version of LABstract on H1N1 Flu Virus -LRB- human swine influenza -RRB- , Updated Guidance for Laboratory Testing , Hospital Setting . 
Copan Flocked Swabs are easy to use , are less invasive and cause minimal discomfort for the patient . 
Copan holds a worldwide patent on Flocked Swabs . 
To transport H1N1 viral specimens collected using swabs , the CDC also recommends that the swab specimen collection vials should contain 1 - 3ml of viral transport medium -LRB- e.g. containing , protein stabilizer , antibiotics to discourage bacterial and fungal growth , and buffer solution -RRB- , such as the BD Universal Viral Transport System , which is manufactured by Copan and distributed in different parts of the world under the Copan brand name Universal Transport Medium -LRB- UTM -RRB- . 
Copan UTM is room temperature stable and available in vials containing 1 or 3 ml of transport medium for different applications . 
About Copan Diagnostics , Inc. . 
With a reputation for innovation in preanalytics , Copan is the leading manufacturer of collection and transport systems in the world . 
Copan offers a complete range of microbial sampling products used for traditional culture analysis and molecular diagnostic assays .

2009-05-05,"-LRB- For full coverage of the flu outbreak , click -LRB- nFLU -RRB- -RRB- \* Quarantine of Mexicans in China sours relations \* Spat revives old tensions between the countries MEXICO CITY , May 5 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - China 's decision to quarantine dozens of Mexicans to guard against the spread of a deadly new flu has soured the relationship between the two exporters , which compete for access to the U.S. market . 
Still , a desire on both sides to boost bilateral trade and ship more Mexican raw materials to fast-growing China means the diplomatic flap should only be a temporary setback . 
Mexico accused China of discrimination after Beijing , worried about the H1N1 flu strain , ordered some 70 Mexicans , including a honeymooning couple , into seclusion , even though none had symptoms . 
Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa called the isolation measures `` unacceptable '' and `` without foundation '' and advised Mexicans against traveling to China . 
China rejected the criticism , saying the steps it had taken were purely medical and not discriminatory . 
`` This should not affect the relationship in the medium-term because we are talking about an overreaction on both sides , '' said Enrique Dussel , an expert on Mexican-Chinese trade at the UNAM University in Mexico City . 
Across China , a Mexican man in Hong Kong was the only person found to be infected with the new flu strain that has killed 26 people in Mexico , two in the United States and made more than 1,500 people ill in 22 countries . 
China sent a plane from Shanghai on Tuesday to pick up about 100 of its citizens from Mexico , mainly tourists , students and business people . 
Some Chinese had been holed up in hotels in northern Mexico for days waiting to leave . 
The spat has revived old tensions between the two nations , which established diplomatic relations in 1972 . 
There has been intense trade rivalry in recent years with Mexico blaming China for muscling in on its top export territory by flooding the United States with cheap goods made in low-wage factories . 
President Felipe Calderon visited Beijing last July in a push to improve bilateral trade and Chinese President Hu Jintao came to Mexico in 2005 promising more investment in areas like auto parts manufacturing and mineral exploration . 
Yet China has leaned more on South American commodities producers like Brazil and Chile for the materials it needs to fuel its export-oriented economy . 
Mexico exported just $ 2 billion worth of goods to China last year , Dussel said , but imported $ 34 billion of Chinese products , from clothing and electronics to tourist trinkets . 
`` Of all the major countries in Latin America , China has the most tense relationship with Mexico , '' said Dan Erikson , an analyst at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue . 
`` The swine flu crisis has just revealed once again that they have n't built the partnership that both countries say that they want , '' Erikson said . 
Other flu-affected nations have had citizens ensnared in China 's quarantine measures , including at least four from the United States and more than 20 from Canada , but Mexico , the epicenter of the outbreak , said it has been unfairly targeted . 
The person-to-person spread of the virus has kept alive fears of a pandemic , though scientists say this strain does not appear more deadly than common seasonal flu , which can kill 250,000 to 500,000 people a year globally . 
Governments around the world are reacting to the outbreak with different levels of severity . 
Many suspended flights or warned their citizens against travel to Mexico . 
Even as Mexico said the flu crisis seemed to be dissipating and prepared to reopen closed businesses , Chinese nationals wearing face masks and loaded with luggage streamed aboard a Chinese-chartered jet that stopped in Mexico City and the northern city of Tijuana . 
`` There is a lot of mutual ignorance and no strategic framework . 
This just shows there is a lot of work to be done '' to improve ties , Dussel said .

2009-05-05,"SINGAPORE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - City-state Singapore has ordered eight people who have just returned from Mexico into a week-long home quarantine , threatening those who violate the order with a fine or a prison term . 
A Health Ministry statement said on Tuesday those who violated the order would be fined S$ 10,000 -LRB- $ 6,789 -RRB- and\/or six months in jail . 
The penalty would be doubled for those who breach the order for a second time . 
`` The Home Quarantine Order is issued under the Infectious Diseases Act to contacts and suspected contacts of the Influenza A -LRB- H1N1-2009 -RRB- virus , with the aim of limiting the spread of Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- in the community , '' it said . 
The eight , two foreigners and six Singaporeans , have to monitor their temperature twice a day and check for flu-like symptoms . 
They must report to a designated public hospital immediately if they develop such symptoms , the ministry said . 
Singapore , which was hit hard by the 2003 SARS respiratory virus epidemic , has not had a confirmed case of the H1N1 virus . 
But the government has warned people to be `` mentally prepared '' for it . 
The virus has infected more than 1,200 people in 21 countries over the past week . 
To date , 27 deaths have been officially confirmed -- 26 in Mexico and one in the United States -- though more than 100 are suspected to have died from the flu .

2009-05-05,"HOUSTON | Tue May 5 , 2009 7:51 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Texas woman with the new H1N1 swine flu died earlier this week , state health officials said on Tuesday , the second death outside of Mexico , where the epidemic appeared to be waning . 
The death of the woman , who was in her 30s and had health problems , followed that of a Mexican toddler visiting Texas . 
U.S. health officials have predicted that the virus would spread and inevitably kill some people , just as seasonal flu does . 
The World Health Organization was monitoring the spread of the virus and said 21 countries have officially reported 1,490 cases . 
The United States has 403 confirmed cases of the swine flu in 38 states , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said , with another 700 `` probable '' cases . 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius warned that `` those numbers will go up , we anticipate , and unfortunately there are likely to be more hospitalizations and more deaths . '' 
Canada has reported 165 cases . 
Health officials said the outbreak seemed to be slowing in Mexico , hardest-hit by the virus , which is a mixture of swine viruses and some elements of human and bird flu . 
At the same time , infections were breaking out globally and are expected to spread . 
Meanwhile , trade skirmishes have flared over pork , with some countries imposing new restrictions , despite assurances by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization that pork , especially cooked pork , was safe to eat . 
The question remained how far the virus would spread and how serious would it be . 
The WHO remained at pandemic alert level 5 , meaning a pandemic is imminent . 
`` If it spreads around the world you will see hundreds of millions of people get infected , '' the WHO 's Dr. Keiji Fukuda told a news briefing . 
If it continues to spread outside the Americas , the WHO would likely move to phase 6 , a full pandemic alert . 
This would prompt countries to activate pandemic plans , distribute antiviral drugs and antibiotics and perhaps advise people to take other precautions like limiting large gatherings . 
`` It 's not so much the number of countries , but whether the virus sets up shop in any of those countries like it has here and starts to spread person to person . 
And given the number of countries that have cases , one would think that eventually that criteria would be met , '' said acting CDC director Dr. Richard Besser . 
He and Fukuda said it would be important to watch the Southern Hemisphere , where winter and the flu season are just beginning . 
Other pandemics have started with a mild new virus in spring that has come back to cause severe disease later in the year . 
The WHO said it would begin sending 2.4 million treatment courses of Roche AG 's and Gilead Sciences Inc 's Tamiflu , an antiviral proven effective against the new flu , to 72 nations , including Mexico . 
Fukuda said the WHO was still trying to answer the most pressing questions , including why more people have died in Mexico than anywhere else . 
`` More people have had mild illness than have had severe illness , '' Fukuda said . 
`` The reasons for that are not clear . 
I do n't think it reflects differences in treatment . '' 
Most of those who have become ill with the new flu , including in Mexico , have recovered with little or no treatment . 
Mexico began to return to normal , but a five-day lockdown ordered by the government to try to slow the influenza 's spread cast a pall on the normally exuberant Cinco de Mayo celebrations . 
Mexican Finance Minister Agustin Carstens said the outbreak could knock as much as half a percentage point off growth this year . 
Because the flu seemed both mild and unstoppable , the CDC eased recommendations for closing schools in the United States when children or teachers had infections , but advised parents to keep sick children at home to prevent further spread . 
H1N1 continued to spark trade and diplomatic quarrels . 
An AeroMexico plane picked up dozens of Mexicans stranded in China after they were quarantined there . 
Mexican President Felipe Calderon condemned the measure as discrimination against his compatriots -LRB- nSP348835 -RRB- . 
Singapore also issued orders to quarantine sick travelers . 
Mexico told the World Trade Organization it was `` deeply disappointed '' by what it called `` divisive measures '' applied by some WTO members against its pork products . 
-LRB- nL5956461 -RRB- `` Mexico urgently requests all its trading partners to eliminate any restrictive measures established on Mexican products , which are not in accordance with the scientific information available , '' the government said . 
U.S. and Canadian pig and pork exports have also been hit by bans that rattled the $ 26 billion-a-year global pork industry , in which Mexico , the United States and Canada are among top exporters .

2009-05-05,"WASHINGTON | Tue May 5 , 2009 2:45 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - With Mexico saying the worst may be over and the new H1N1 virus starting to look more like a seasonal flu strain in the United States and elsewhere , critics are going to start asking if public health officials overreacted to the outbreak . 
Since the new swine flu virus was first identified two weeks ago in two children in Texas and California , the World Health Organization pushed its pandemic alert level from a three to a five , meaning a pandemic is imminent . 
Mexico closed schools , stopped public events and took a big hit to tourism . 
The U.S. government mobilized 25 percent of its stockpile of antiviral drugs and started work on a vaccine against the new strain . 
But the death toll is being rolled back as Mexican officials realize it will be impossible to know if long-buried or cremated victims died of H1N1 swine flu . 
And while the infection is spreading rapidly across the United States , it appears to be no worse than seasonal flu . 
Scientists who study flu say the coordinated , global response was appropriate . 
`` If it does n't become more virulent , first of all , many people will heave a great sigh of relief , '' said Dr. Scott Lillibridge , who helped set up the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 's Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Program and who is now at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston . 
But Lillibridge echoes what the WHO and CDC have been saying : viruses mutate and change all the time and it is too early to say how bad this virus really is . 
`` We are only a few days into a major international mobilization for an outbreak that could continue months into the future , '' Lillibridge said in a telephone interview . 
The U.S. government has been preparing for this scenario for years . 
One of the messages that has come up repeatedly is that the 1918 pandemic , cited as the worst-case scenario because it killed upwards of 40 million people , started with a mild arrival of a new virus , now identified as H1N1 , in the spring . 
It disappeared over the summer , but roared back with a vengeance in August . 
`` Will there be later disease , and if so , will it be more severe ? '' 
CDC acting director Dr. Richard Besser asked on Monday . 
`` There is no doubt in my mind that CDC , the Department of Homeland Security , and the Health and Human Services Department will use the lull to get ready , '' said risk communications consultant Peter Sandman , who has taken a special interest in pandemic flu . 
`` They will stay focused on this problem . 
They will continue to get ready for a possible pandemic in the fall . '' 
Many public health experts also remember the 1976 swine flu outbreak that was n't . 
Manufacturers raced to make a vaccine and 40 million Americans were vaccinated amid a monster public relations campaign . 
But the flu never spread . 
`` One big difference between then and now was that when the swine flu was detected in 1976 , it was found at a single military installation in Ft. . 
Dix , New Jersey , '' said Dr. Harvey Fineberg , president of the Institute of Medicine and author of `` The Epidemic that Never Was . '' 
`` In the ensuing weeks and months it was not detected elsewhere -- not elsewhere in New Jersey , not elsewhere in the United States , not elsewhere in the rest of the world . '' 
Worse yet , some people developed a rare neurological reaction to the vaccine called Guillain-Barre syndrome . 
Even now , a considerable minority of people believe that vaccines are harmful . 
In contrast , said Fineberg , this virus spread globally in a matter of weeks , carried by holidaymakers and jet travel , and has shown it can be transmitted from one person to another . 
`` Last week the lesson is we got lucky , '' said Sandman . 
`` We have no reason to think we will stay lucky . '' 
He hopes the alarm bells will continue to ring , at an appropriate level . 
`` I just hope the government is more worried about the public being caught with its pants down than the government being called fearmongerers , '' Sandman said . 
`` One thing we have learned about flu is we should not be surprised by anything , '' he said .

2009-05-06,"Advert warns about the dangers of swine flu The government has appointed a swine flu `` tsar '' for England to deal with the threat of a pandemic . 
Ian Dalton , currently chief executive of NHS North East , will become national director for NHS Flu Resilience . 
He will ensure that the NHS `` is in the best possible position to protect the population , '' the health secretary said . 
The appointment came as the number of UK cases of the H1N1 virus reached 28 and information leaflets about the disease began dropping through doors . 
Mr Dalton , who will take up the post immediately , will coordinate the supply of anti-viral medication and the implementation of any future vaccination program . 
He said : `` The NHS is well-placed to deal with such an eventuality and I am looking forward to working with colleagues throughout England to ensure the NHS continues to respond appropriately to any developing situation . '' 
Health Secretary Alan Johnson said Mr Dalton would `` support the vital operational side of our plans '' for a major flu outbreak . 
On Tuesday , England 's chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson warned that it was too early to assume the swine flu outbreak was a mild infection just because no-one in the UK had died . 
`` We must not be complacent . 
We know that flu viruses can change their character very rapidly as they move through populations , '' he said . 
Sir Liam spoke after the latest case of swine flu , an adult from the Slough area of Berkshire , was confirmed . 
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader It brought the overall totals to 24 in England and four in Scotland . 
Five UK schools remain closed after being hit by the virus . 
Three are in London - Alleyn 's School in Dulwich , Dolphin School in Battersea and South Hampstead High School . 
Downend in South Gloucestershire and Paignton Community and Sports College in Devon have also shut their doors . 
A spokeswoman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families confirmed that officials were working with schools and exam boards to put contingency plans in place for the summer exam season . 
`` Arrangements will be made on a case by case basis , so that all students are fairly treated , '' she said . 
Exam regulator Ofqual is due to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss plans , which could mean pupils sitting exams elsewhere , or receiving final grades based on other evidence , such as coursework or modules already completed . 
Members of the public can call 08001513513 for recorded information about swine flu . 
The number for NHS 24 in Scotland is 08454 24 24 24 .

2009-05-06,"Technology Reporter , BBC News , Silicon Valley 20,000 plus new samples of malware are detected every day , say experts Twelve million computers have been hijacked by cyber-criminals and detected by security vendor McAfee since January , the firm has said . 
It reports there has been a 50 % increase in the number of detected so-called `` zombie '' computers since 2008 . 
The true number of newly hijacked PCs is likely to be higher than those detected by McAfee alone . 
The figures come as a report from Deloitte said a global approach to cyber-security was needed . 
`` Doing nothing is not an option , '' said Deloitte 's Greg Pellegrino . 
Everything that depended on cyberspace face unprecedented risks , said Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu -LRB- DTT -RRB- . 
`` This issue is moving so quickly , and with so much at stake economically and in terms of safety and security for people , we do n't have 100 years to figure this out , '' explained Mr Pellegrino , who is a global public sector industry leader at DTT . 
McAfee also revealed that the United States now hosted the world 's largest percentage of infected computers at 18 % with China a not too distant second with just over 13 % . 
`` The massive expansion of these botnets provides cyber-criminals with the infrastructure they need to flood the web with malware , '' said Jeff Green , senior vice-president of McAfee . 
`` Essentially , this is cyber-crime enablement . '' 
The DTT findings revealed a growing awareness of the role the internet plays in so many different aspects of our lives from security to commerce and from transportation to communication . 
Better cyber-security measures will benefit global commerce , says the report `` We are seeing this change from protecting the internet to a conversation about how we succeed and prosper in cyberspace , '' Mr Pellegrino told the BBC . 
`` Security spending is growing at a rate never seen before while the threat environment is growing at a pace of 40 % a year . 
`` In terms of volume and severity of incidents , the math does n't work and we have to come up with a different approach that requires public and private sectors working together , '' Mr Pellegrino said . 
`` We are talking about daily living , '' said fellow author Gary McAlum , who is a retired US Air Force colonel and senior manager of security and privacy services at Deloitte . 
`` There is a lot of discussion about the economy and the military and the public and private sector , but we have now reached a sense of urgency about the interconnectedness of all these areas . '' 
That view was echoed by a member of the US military top brass who just gave evidence to a branch of the House Armed Services Committee . 
`` Our economy , the nation 's critical infrastructure , and many of our military operations depend on unfettered access to cyberspace , '' said Lt Gen Keith Alexander , the director of the National Security Agency -LRB- NSA -RRB- who also heads the Pentagon 's new Cyber Command . 
`` Maintaining freedom of action in cyberspace in the 21st Century is as inherent to US interests as freedom of the seas was in the 19th Century , and access to air and space in the 20th Century . '' 
He has called for the creation of a digital warfare force for the future and has stated that the US needs to reorganise its offensive and defensive cyber-operations . 
The Deloitte study included interviews conducted with government officials and industry experts from around the world . 
While it revealed a patchwork approach to the problem it also showed it was one that was gaining prominence . 
There are 32,000 suspected cyber-attacks every 24 hours , says the NSA `` We were very pleased that there was a similar tone and awareness and leadership effort coming from different countries across the world , '' Mr Pellegrino said . 
`` Clearly this particular issue has a different context depending on where you are in the world . 
We can not afford to go backwards . '' 
In America , President Obama has made the issue of cyber-security a priority . 
Shortly after taking office he ordered a 60-day review that has now been delivered to his desk . 
It is understood the release of the review has been delayed by the ongoing H1N1 swine flu crisis . 
When the report is made public , it is expected that the president will also announce his choice for cyber-security tsar to lead the charge . 
While the Deloitte research said security in Asia-Pacific needed to `` catch up '' it noted that the United Kingdom was in the process of writing a national cyber strategy with an emphasis on public-private partnership . 
On the continent , the European Commission has urged member states to co-ordinate on cyber-security measures , while in Latin America the report authors conclude that there is a `` diversity of approaches '' . 
Canada has completed its own cyber-security review and this year will be implementing the National Cyber-Security Strategy as well as creating a new Directorate of Cyber-Security with a mandate to engage closely with the private sector . 
Despite all these efforts , the Deloitte authors point out that time is of the essence . 
`` Not only do we have to take action , we do n't have enough time , '' warned Mr Pellegrino . 
Mr McAlum agreed and said mapping a clear strategy was crucial . 
`` We need to get our house in order first so that we can interact with the rest of the world with one voice , with clear roles and responsibilities aligned . ''

2009-05-06,"Manny Pacquiao knocked out Britain 's Ricky Hatton last weekend Health officials in the Philippines have asked the country 's star boxer to delay his return from the US as a precaution against swine flu . 
Manny Pacquiao was scheduled to return home on Friday , after his knockout victory against Britain 's Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas at the weekend . 
But Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque urged the champion to postpone his flight . 
There is no suggestion that the boxer actually has swine flu . 
But his fight last weekend was in Las Vegas , where confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus have been reported . 
The health secretary told reporters he wanted Mr Pacquiao to delay his triumphal return to the Philippines until at least next Tuesday . 
Mr Duque explained that it takes about five days for swine flu symptoms to appear , and he was hoping Mr Pacquiao and his entourage would impose `` self-quarantine '' until then , to be absolutely sure they had not contracted the virus . 
The Philippines was due to hold a `` national day of celebration '' for Mr Pacquiao this Friday , in honor of his win . 
But Mr Duque said there were concerns that the motorcade , which was due to drive through Manila in celebration , could pose a risk of spreading the virus . 
There are no confirmed swine flu cases in the Philippines , although some patients are under observation . 
According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization , nearly 1,500 people around the globe have been infected with swine flu , most of them in Mexico . 
Two fatalities have been reported in the United States .

2009-05-06,"Zoo animal placed in quarantine over swine flu fears Wednesday 6 May 2009 15.16 BST It was lonely enough anyway , being the only pig in one of the world 's most devoutly Muslim countries . 
And that was before swine flu . 
The white pig , a resident of Kabul Zoo , and believed to be the only such animal in a country where pork and pig-related products are illegal for religious reasons , has been placed in quarantine over fears it could spread the virus . 
The animal , the sole survivor of a pair of pigs donated by China in 2002 , normally grazes alongside deer and goats at the rundown zoo . 
But at the weekend it was removed and put in solitary confinement after visitors became alarmed . 
`` For now the pig is under quarantine . 
We built it a room because of swine influenza , '' Aziz Gul Saqib , the director of the zoo , told Reuters . 
`` We 've done this because people are worried about getting the flu . '' 
While there is speculation that the new strain of the H1N1 virus could have originated on industrial pig farms before spreading to humans , there would appear to be little risk from a solitary pig , particularly in a country with no direct flight connections with Mexico , where the majority of the 1,000 or so worldwide swine flu cases have been identified so far . 
Saqib conceded that there was no real public health argument for locking the pig away : `` We understand that , but most people do n't have enough knowledge . 
When they see the pig in the cage they get worried and think that they could get ill . '' 
The pig arrived as part of a consignment of animals despatched by China to restock a zoo that had become a symbol of Afghanistan 's descent into chaos during the country 's civil war and the rule of the Taliban . 
Rebel fighters ate the zoo 's deer and rabbits and shot dead its elephant . 
One militant climbed into the pen of the resident lion , Marjan , and was promptly killed and eaten . 
The man 's brother responded by throwing a grenade into the enclosure , leaving Marjan blind and lame . 
China 's planeload of animals included a pair of lions to replace Marjan , who died in early 2002 . 
Lonely though Kabul zoo 's pig might be , it has actually escaped lightly by the standards of its peers in some other countries . 
At the weekend health officials in Baghdad said three wild boars at the city 's zoo had been destroyed because of fears about flu . 
Egypt , meanwhile , has ordered the slaughter of the estimated 250,000 pigs inside the country , eaten by the country 's Christian minority , even though the World Health Organisation stresses that the virus can not be passed on through properly cooked meat .

2009-05-06,"A blood sample is taken from a pig by Malaysia 's veterinary personnel during an inspection at a pig farm in an effort to prevent swine flu in Ipoh April 29 , 2009 . 
Credit : Reuters\/The New Straits Times Press\/Muhaizan Yahya \* Flu viruses can survive freezing , be present on thawed meat \* Blood of H1N1 infected pigs may contain virus \* Meat from sick pigs or pigs found dead must not be consumed \* WHO drawing up guidelines to protect workers handling pigs HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Meat from pigs infected with the new H1N1 virus should n't be used for human consumption , the World Health Organization cautioned on Wednesday , adding it was drawing up guidelines to protect workers handling pigs . 
The WHO comments appear more cautious than those from the Food and Agriculture Organization -LRB- FAO -RRB- and World Organization for Animal Health -LRB- OIE -RRB- , which said import bans are not required to safeguard public health because the disease is not food-borne and has not been identified in dead animal tissue . 
The WHO however said it was possible for flu viruses to survive the freezing process and be present in thawed meat , as well as in blood . 
`` Meat from sick pigs or pigs found dead should not be processed or used for human consumption under any circumstances , '' Jorgen Schlundt , director of WHO 's Department of Food Safety , Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases . 
`` While it is possible for influenza viruses to survive the freezing process and be present on thawed meat , there are no data available on the survival of Influenza A\/H1N1 on meat nor any data on the infectious dose for people , '' he wrote in an email reply to questions from Reuters concerning the safety of pork , respiratory secretions and blood of H1N1-infected pigs . 
Schlundt warned people to be cautious with blood and meat-juices from H1N1-infected pigs . 
`` The likelihood of influenza viruses to be in the blood of an infected animal depends on the specific virus . 
Blood -LRB- and meat-juice -RRB- from influenza H1N1-infected pigs may potentially contain virus , but at present , this has not been established , '' Schlundt said . 
`` Nonetheless , in general , we recommend that persons involved in activities where they could come in contact with large amounts of blood and secretions , such as those slaughtering\/eviscerating pigs , wear appropriate protective equipment , '' he said . 
The new H1N1 swine flu virus is being transmitted from person to person , not from pigs to people . 
Its global spread has prompted many countries to limit pork imports , however . 
As many as 20 governments have imposed import bans on live pigs and meat from affected countries to prevent exposure to the virus . 
Such fears increased after Canadian authorities said on Saturday a herd of swine was infected by a farmer who had returned from Mexico . 
The WHO said 22 countries have officially reported 1,534 cases of the flu virus . 
While health officials say the outbreak appears to be slowing down in Mexico , authorities everywhere are asking how far the virus would spread and how serious it would be . 
U.S. officials confirmed that a Texas woman with the H1N1 swine flu virus died earlier this week , the second death outside Mexico . 
Last week , a Mexican toddler visiting Texas died . 
Mexican officials have reported 29 confirmed deaths . 
While the new virus is mainly spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing , experts do not know for sure how this virus came to be , which animal passed it to the first human patient and when that occurred . 
But the case of the farmer infecting the pigs in Canada fueled fears of the virus yet again jumping the species barrier -- this time from pig to human -- and possibly becoming more virulent in the process . 
Joseph Domenech , FAO chief veterinary officer , said on Tuesday : `` This new strain of influenza virus does not contaminate humans easily and has a very low pathogenicity for both humans and pigs , unlike the avian flu which killed millions of poultry . '' 
On Tuesday , Alex Thiermann , senior adviser to the OIE 's director-general , said there was no difference between raw and cooked meat in terms of H1N1 transmission risks . 
`` The OIE is very concerned that differences are being made between cooked and not cooked meat . 
All pork products are safe for consumption , '' Thiermann said .

2009-05-06,"Boost Natural Killer Cells to Prevent Swine Flu \* Reuters is not responsible for the content in this press release . 
Herbal and nutritional supplements can dramatically increase protection from swine flu by increasing levels of Natural Killer Cells , which destroy viruses , without attacking healthy body cells . 
Drastic measures including closing schools , canceling graduation ceremonies and airline flights are being used to slow spread of the H1N1 swine flu virus . 
Governmental authorities recommend increased hand washing and avoiding handshakes , which did not prevent previous influenza epidemics from killing millions of people , in 1918 . 
Rick Sponaugle , MD , Medical Director of Florida Detox and Wellness Institute , recommends increasing levels of Natural Killer Cell white blood cells , to prevent infection with swine flu and other viruses . 
Natural Killer Cells protect us from viruses , during new infections , while other white blood cells attempt to produce antibodies against new viruses . 
Research proves over the counter herbal and nutritional supplements can increase Natural Killer Cell levels . 
Dr. Sponaugle reported , `` We have measured 60 percent increases in Natural Killer Cells , using over the counter formulas containing naturally occurring inositol phosphates . 
The 60 percent Natural Killer Cell increase is consistent with results published in scientific studies . '' 
Since Inositol phosphates occur naturally in the body , there is essentially no risk of allergic reaction . 
AHCC , is an immune booster extracted from mushrooms which increased Natural Killer Cell levels , 200 to 300 percent , in published studies . 
Florida Detox and Wellness Institute increased Natural Killer Cell levels in one severely immune suppressed patient , from 3 per milliliter to 150 per milliliter . 
Natural Killer Cell levels tend to decrease with age . 
Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome , fibromyalgia , Lymes Disease , Babesia , or HIV are more likely to have lower Natural Killer Cell levels . 
Herpes Simplex , Human Herpes 6 , Epstein Barr and Cytomegalus viruses also suppress immunity . 
Dr. Sponaugle also recommends reducing sugar consumption , to increase immunity . 
Studies reveal consuming 100 grams of sugar reduced immunity for over five hours . 
Researchers measured activity of neutrophils , white blood cells which engulf and destroy bacteria and other harmful microorganisms . 
Neutrophil activity was reduced over 45 percent , two hours , after sugar consumption . 
, 30:613 , 1977 Am . 
, 26:180 , 1973 . 
Excessive sugar consumption causes chronic immune suppression , in many Americans . 
The average American consumes 125 grams of sucrose sugar daily , in addition to 50 grams of other refined sugars daily . 
A typical 12 ounce cola drink contains ten teaspoons or 41 grams of sugar . 
A Milky War candy bar contains 35 grams of sugar . 
Many herbal teas and energy drinks are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup , which is essentially a refined sugar . 
Estimates indicate twenty percent of Americans consume over 75 grams of high fructose corn syrup daily . 
Since different parts of the immune system work together , through chemical messenger systems , increasing neutrophil activity can enhance Natural Killer Cell activity .

2009-05-07,"Khanzir was given to the zoo by China in 2002 Afghanistan 's only known pig has been quarantined because of fears over swine flu , officials from Kabul Zoo say . 
The pig , a curiosity in a country where pork products are illegal , lives at the zoo , where he had previously enjoyed grazing next to deer and goats . 
However visitors expressed fears that the animal could be carrying the H1N1 virus and he was moved into isolation . 
The director of the zoo , Aziz Gul Saqib , says the pig , whose name is Khanzir , is strong and healthy . 
Speaking to the BBC World Service , Mr Saqib says : `` The only reason we moved him was because Afghan people do n't have a lot of knowledge about swine flu , and so when they see a pig they get worried and think they will get ill . '' 
The animal , known simply as Khanzir , the Pashtu word for pig , was given to the zoo by China in 2002 . 
The zoo director says Khanzir has been moved to a large space with lots of windows and fresh air and that he hopes the pig will be quarantined for only a few days . 
Acknowledging that being Afghanistan 's only pig is a lonely existence , Mr Saqib says he hopes to find Khanzir a female companion soon . 
However , he says , because of swine flu , `` it is a dangerous and difficult time to get a new pig for our pig '' .

2009-05-07,"cents One patient is pupil at school closed due to outbreak cents Johnson : no evidence of ` sustained ' human transmission South Hampstead high school , which was reopening today . 
Photograph : Carl de Souza\/AFP\/Getty Images Two new cases of swine flu have been diagnosed in the UK , one in a child , the health secretary , Alan Johnson , said today . 
The child is a pupil at one of the five schools that have already been closed due to the outbreak . 
Johnson said there was no evidence of `` sustained '' person to person transmission of the virus in Britain . 
But he warned in a Commons statement : `` This does remain a serious situation which could rapidly escalate . '' 
The new cases bring the UK total to 34 . 
Johnson told MPs an alternative quick-response system was being developed in case the outbreak escalates before a dedicated flu helpline is opened in the autumn . 
The exams regulator Ofqual was meeting today to discuss contingency plans for pupils disrupted by the outbreak . 
It is understood that children could sit exams elsewhere or , if they are sick with the virus , be awarded a grade based on papers or coursework they have completed . 
Johnson and the chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , will give a further update on the outbreak later today . 
Laboratory tests are being carried out on 390 people who may have the H1N1 virus , the Health Protection Agency said . 
News of the latest cases came as South Hampstead high school , in north-west London , became the first of the five closed schools to reopen . 
Four other schools Paignton community and sports college , in Devon ; Alleyn 's school , in Dulwich , south-east London ; Downend school , in south Gloucestershire ; and the private preparatory Dolphin school , in Battersea , south London remain closed . 
GCSE exams began across the UK today with a design and technology practical test , under the OCR board . 
It was not known whether pupils at any of the affected schools were sitting this exam . 
Schools hit by the illness are rescheduling exams or asking for special consideration for GCSE and A-level pupils . 
A Department for Children , Schools and Families spokeswoman confirmed that officials were working with Ofqual and the exam boards to put in place contingency plans . 
She said : `` Arrangements will be made on a case by case basis , so that all students are fairly treated . 
Basing final results on other evidence , like coursework or modules already completed -LRB- also known as special consideration -RRB- , is just one contingency arrangement , and would only happen in specific circumstances where a student was unable to take a particular exam . 
`` This is a tried and tested system that exam boards use to award students grades if they are unable to take an exam for a given reason . '' 
Alleyn 's school , which closed after five year seven pupils were diagnosed with swine flu on Monday , said it was rescheduling A-level exams in art , biology and foreign languages for next week . 
The government today pledged # 6m in aid to help poor countries in the global fight against swine flu . 
The money from the Department for International Development will be given to the World Health Organisation and the UN for drugs , logistics and training to assist efforts to stop the spread of the virus and to prepare countries for a pandemic .

2009-05-07,"No exercise , more than lying around , tied to fat in kids Full Article Nigeria meningitis death toll rises above 2,000 ABUJA | Thu May 7 , 2009 1:13 am IST ABUJA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A meningitis outbreak in Nigeria is more serious than initially feared with the death toll rising more than sixfold over the past two months , the Health Ministry said on Wednesday . 
Deaths from the epidemic have risen to 2,148 since the first case was recorded in December from 333 announced by the health minister in early March . 
The number of reported cases has climbed more than eightfold to 47,902 over the same period . 
About two-thirds of Nigeria 's 36 states are affected by the epidemic , the ministry said . 
Nigeria is Africa 's most populous country with a population of more than 140 million . 
UNICEF said last month that more than 2,500 people had been killed by meningitis this year in West and Central Africa in what could be the worst epidemic for five years . 
Nigeria , Niger , Burkina Faso and Chad are considered Africa 's high-risk zone . 
Meningitis is the inflammation of the tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord , and can be caused by viral or bacterial infections . 
It spreads mainly through kisses , sneezes , coughs and in close living quarters . 
The meningitis death toll in Nigeria since December is almost 50 times the number of people killed worldwide by the H1N1 swine flu virus . 
But the speed with which it has spread underscores the potential dangers if swine flu reaches Africa . 
Basic healthcare is limited in rural parts of Nigeria , where most people live on less than $ 2 a day , despite the country 's huge oil resources . 
Many Nigerians fear that an outbreak of swine flu would be devastating . 
The Health Ministry said no suspected case of swine flu had been recorded in the country but that it had taken steps to contain any outbreak . 
The worst recent meningitis epidemic in West and Central Africa occurred in 1996-97 when an estimated 100,000 people were infected in Nigeria and 50,000 in Niger .

2009-05-07,"Flu hygiene hard in slums as Mexico scrubs off flu CIUDAD NEZAHUALCOYOTL , Mexico | Thu May 7 , 2009 4:26 pm EDT CIUDAD NEZAHUALCOYOTL , Mexico -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The water dribbling from the tap is not enough for Miriam Guerrero to clean her fingernails , let alone wash down her hair salon in a Mexico City slum as the country fights a deadly flu virus . 
With 44 people dead from the new H1N1 flu virus -- many of them in the sprawling capital of 20 million -- the government has urged Mexicans to scrub up as often as they can . 
But while the wealthy hose down storefronts with disinfectant and squirt hand sanitizer gel abundantly , impoverished families in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl -- a vast , grimy slum on the northeast edge of the capital -- barely have running water . 
Low rainfall has left Mexico City 's already strained reservoirs badly depleted , and taps are driest in the poorest areas . 
Even though city officials have patched up leaky pipes several times , poor neighborhoods still suffer chronic shortages . 
`` When the water 's running short it 's not easy to keep washing your hands like they say , and there 's not enough to disinfect all the furniture , '' said Guerrero , who often fills her metal bucket from a water truck to clean her small salon . 
Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl , known as `` Neza , '' and other poor neighborhoods like nearby Iztapalapa , largely rely on the trucks that come around sporadically . 
Countries around the world are taking measures to halt the spread of the virus , which has infected more than 2,000 people in 24 countries . 
After grinding almost to a halt for several days , Mexico and its capital were getting back to normal on Thursday , reopening schools , bars , churches and restaurants as health officials said the worst of Mexico 's outbreak was over . 
But the government warned it was too early to stop taking hygiene measures . 
Many people still wore face masks and Mexico City restaurants sanitized diners ' hands as they arrived . 
Home to around 1 million people , Neza is infamous for being next to a huge open-pit garbage dump . 
`` We are worried about colds , the flu , especially being so close to the dump , '' said Alicia Soto , a vendor of sunflower seed snacks who took her daughter to the doctor two weeks ago , alarmed by her flu-like symptoms . 
Local health officials say they can not solve the water problem , but they are carting boxes filled with bottles of hand sanitizer to as many health clinics as they can .

2009-05-07,"Pigs might fly , but swine flu ! 
I called the swine flu hotline , but all I got was crackling . 
The reference to `` crackling '' , or pork rinds , starts a host of Internet jokes and puns about the new H1N1 strain of flu that has the world on edge but fortunately , so far , has not reached the pandemic proportions feared originally . 
Piggybacking this information exchange is a wealth of disinformation . 
Although this new strain of swine flu has complex origins not restricted to pigs , the association has stuck . 
To the delight of many , the subject has spammed enough jokes cartoons and bad puns to last out a quarantine . 
I ve been sent home because I came out in rashers , is one doing the rounds . 
You can cure it with oinkment , comes the reply . 
Amid the bad puns are a host of quirky and off beat stories that are keeping the web abuzz . 
Spare a thought for the only pig in Afghanistan , a curiosity so rare in this strictly Muslim country that it actually lives at Kabul Zoo , where it is exhibited along with a pair of lions , some monkeys , a bear , and assorted other wildlife . 
Although the poor little piggy is unlikely to ever come into contact with another of its species and even less likely to come into contact with an Afghan it has been quarantined indoors . 
Actually , it might be the best thing to happen to it . 
On every visit I have paid to Kabul s zoo , the creature has been subjected to abusive taunts by curious onlookers as well as the the not infrequent thrown stone . 
Pig farmers in Kansas City were making a great effort to save their bacon by banning outsiders from coming into contact with their swine herds . 
They even told staff with the sniffles to keep away on full pay . 
`` If humans give it to pigs , we do n't have things like Tamiflu for pigs . 
We do n't have antivirals . 
We have no treatment other than to give them aspirin , '' said Jennifer Greiner , chief veterinarian with the National Pork Producers group . 
In Malaysia , thousands of Hindus sought blessings from goup of wild boars they believe have mystical powers , the Daily Star reported . 
Pigs have long been known to be one of nature s most intelligent creatures , but this group appeared to have mastered the art of a free lunch by making a temple their home , where they are fed by visitors who arrive from as far afield as Thailand and Singapore . 
The pigs do n't have any disease . 
The country is diseased , '' said Marzouk Badr Adli after residents of the poor Manshiet Nasr shantytown of Cairo clashed with authorities who tried to cull his herd . 
The United Nations said killing the pigs would be a mistake , but even after the World Health Organization formally distanced itself from using the name swine flu , the language was still causing problems . 
Under Jewish dietary laws , pigs are also considered unclean and pork is a forbidden food , but Israeli authorities made a ham-fisted attempt to change the name . 
`` We will call it Mexico flu . 
We wo n't call it swine flu , '' Deputy Health Minister Yakov Litzman said . 
prompting an immediate protest from the Mexican ambassador . 
Confusingly , they then settled on South American flu , despite Mexico still being in North America the last time anyone checked . 
The European Union , mindful of its enormous domestic pork industry -LRB- and anxious , perhaps , to avoid creating a swine lake -RRB- , said it would call the new virus `` novel flu '' . 
In true EU style , however , it then produced an internal document which called it novel flu in English , Mexican flu in French and swine flu in German . 
it truly shows the selfish of American not taking serious steps to prevent H1N1 spreading , as U.S has good and sound health care system , so H1N1 is not a big concern to most Americans , but considering you brought the virus to worldwide , including those countries without good health care system , you should be guilty !

2009-05-07,"By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Thu May 7 , 2009 7:41 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. health officials predicted worsening outbreaks of the new H1N1 flu on Thursday , and a top global health official predicted up to a third of the world 's population could eventually become infected even as Mexican officials said the worst was over . 
A batch of detailed studies on the new swine flu virus showed it was a strange marriage between a triple-hybrid virus with pig , human and bird elements and a European swine virus not seen before in North America . 
But some pork bans appeared to be easing and U.S. agriculture officials promised unspecified help to farmers . 
Mexico 's confirmed death toll ticked up to 44 as labs tested a backlog of samples from people who died in March and April . 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 896 confirmed cases of the new H1N1 flu in 41 states . 
U.S. officials have said they expect the swine influenza virus to spread to all 50 states and to cause many infections ranging from mild to severe . 
There have been two deaths in the United States . 
`` So far we are not seeing any signs of this petering out , '' acting CDC Director Dr Richard Besser said . 
`` We are on the upswing . '' 
And even though Mexican officials said they were over the worst , Besser said there was still significant transmission there , too . 
More than 2,000 people in 24 countries have been infected with the virus , the World Health Organization said . 
The WHO 's Dr. Keiji Fukuda urged Asian governments to stay alert for a possible wider pandemic that `` could infect a third or more of the world 's population in the next several months , in the next year . 
`` Even if the illnesses appear relatively mild on an individual level , with large numbers of infections on the global population , you can get large numbers of seriously ill people , '' Fukuda told a conference in Bangkok . 
Fukuda said H1N1 flu is not yet spreading in a sustained way outside North America , so the global pandemic level remains at 5 out of 6 . 
Fukuda said governments should be ready for H1N1 to turn into something far more serious . 
`` This is a time in which we can work with countries to be as prepared as possible , '' he said . 
In a series of reports rushed into the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday , researchers said influenza viruses from animals are an ongoing threat and doctors need to keep a lookout for them . 
`` As recent events suggest , the generation of novel influenza viruses through the reassortment of swine influenza viruses with other human and animal influenza viruses may be inevitable , '' the CDC 's Dr Lyn Finelli and colleagues wrote in one report . 
So far the genetic analysis gives no clue about where the new virus came from , the researchers told a news conference . 
The European genes were especially mystifying . 
`` Those genes had never been seen in the United States before , '' the CDC 's Dr Michael Shaw said . 
`` We have no idea whether they came to this hemisphere by human or animal . '' 
In Mexico , millions of high school and university students returned to classes as the country got back on its feet after shutting public places last week to avoid spread of the disease . 
After a five-day business shutdown , the government has let bars , cinemas , restaurants and workplaces reopen . 
Theme park operator Six Flags said it planned to reopen its Mexico City park on Friday after being given permission by Mexico 's government to do so . 
But visitors to government-run buildings were asked to wear surgical masks and wash their hands with antibacterial soap before entering . 
Restaurants also sanitized diners ' hands as they arrived . 
`` It 's obviously a worry for us that after we allow many activities people can forget the -LRB- health -RRB- recommendations , '' Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said . 
This might not be easy for many , like hair salon operator Miriam Guerrero in drought-stricken Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl , a Mexico City-area slum . 
`` When the water 's running short it 's not easy to keep washing your hands like they say , and there 's not enough to disinfect all the furniture , '' Guerrero said . 
The U.S. pork industry got some good news after being battered by import bans by nearly two-dozen countries . 
`` Clearly pork producers have suffered and will continue to do so until we get this turned around , '' Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee . 
`` We are looking at ways we can be of assistance or help . 
And Russia signaled it may lift bans placed on pork by June 1 , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative said . 
Russia , the fourth-largest export market for U.S. pork , has banned all meat from five U.S. states and banned raw pork from a few others . 
It has also banned pork from certain Canadian provinces , the United Kingdom and Spain .

2009-05-08,"Princess , Pacquiao 's two-year-old daughter , welcomed her father home Philippine boxing champion Manny Pacquiao has arrived in Manila , returning from the US after winning the IBO light-welterweight crown . 
He was greeted by his children and dignitaries , including Environment Secretary Lito Atienza . 
Pacquiao had ignored government requests to delay his return as a precaution against swine flu . 
President Gloria Arroyo has said there will be a parade in the capital and a national holiday to mark his victory . 
However , she said she would not give the boxer an audience at the presidential palace until next week . 
Manny Pacquiao knocked out Britain 's Ricky Hatton in the second round of their Las Vegas title fight on Saturday . 
Health Secretary Francisco Duque urged him to delay his return to the Philippines for five days to ensure that there was no risk of he or his entourage bringing swine flu into the country . 
Confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus have been reported in Las Vegas , but there was no suggestion that Pacquiao actually had the virus . 
But Mr Duque said there were concerns that the motorcade , which was due to drive through Manila in celebration , could pose a risk of spreading the virus . 
Crowds have gathered at a cathedral in the center of the city which Pacquaio traditionally visits on his return from a fight abroad , but it is not known whether he will go , given the health concerns .

2009-05-08,"Tamiflu has been given to pupils and staff at Alleyn 's School Four children and one adult , all linked to the same school , have been diagnosed with swine flu , taking the total number of cases in the UK to 39 . 
The affected school - Alleyn 's in Dulwich , south-east London - has already seen six pupils diagnosed with the H1N1 virus earlier this week . 
All 1,200 pupils as well as staff have already been given Tamiflu antiviral drugs and the school has been closed . 
More than 400 people in the UK are currently being tested for the virus . 
In a statement , the Health Protection Agency said of the latest cases : `` All patients are recovering at home . 
`` Close contacts of these cases are receiving antivirals as a precautionary measure . '' 
We do n't want to take any risks with children at this stage when we do n't know enough about the disease Sir Liam Donaldson , England 's Chief Medical Officer The Department of Health added that so far , all infections in the UK have been mild , and cases have been diagnosed and treated early . 
England 's Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson has defended the policy of closing schools after criticism that the government was overreacting to an infection that appeared to be less dangerous than originally feared . 
`` We do n't want to take any risks with children at this stage when we do n't know enough about the disease , '' he said on Thursday . 
Earlier it emerged that British researchers have unravelled the first genetic code of swine flu from European samples . 
Health Secretary Alan Johnson described the work as a `` significant step '' . 
"
2009-05-08,"cents Advice will be reviewed if virus continues to spread cents Over-50s might have some immunity to H1N1 strain Swine flu may be more infectious than so far appears in the UK and the current guidance on catching it may have to be changed , the chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , warned today . 
The World Health Organisation concurred , saying that if unchecked , swine flu could affect almost a third of the population 2 billion people . 
Although currently it is only mild , the attack rate of the strain now affecting 23 countries is around 25-30 % , Donaldson said , although he added that it was possible people over the age of 50 might have some immunity to the virus . 
In the UK , the Health Protection Agency says that only those who have been within one metre of an infected person for more than an hour are considered to be at risk . 
`` I think it will be more transmissible than that when it gets going , '' said Donaldson . 
`` We may need to look at that advice . '' 
Anybody with flu-like symptoms is already being told to stay at home to avoid infecting other people . 
He said that if flu spreads and becomes more severe , particularly in the winter months , there will be concerns about people working at close quarters in offices and traveling together on tubes , trains and buses . 
Donaldson , giving a joint briefing in London with Alan Johnson , the health secretary , said the top laboratories in the world were still analyzing the flu strain now said to have killed 42 people in Mexico , which also has 1,112 confirmed cases . 
`` We have to wait another few weeks for characterisation of the virus , '' he said . 
Last night five swine flu cases were confirmed in Brazil and Argentina . 
Brazilian Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao said four young adults contracted the flu outside the country - three in Mexico , and one in Florida . 
Prior to Thursday , Colombia was the only South American nation to confirm swine flu with its borders . 
In Mexico and in the USA which Donaldson said was about a month behind Mexico in the progress of its flu outbreak the picture looks different to here , with many more cases apparently transmitted from one human to another . 
Only 10 of the 34 cases confirmed in the UK were actually acquired here . 
On the possibility that people over the age of 50 might have some immunity to the virus , which is of the H1N1 strain , Donaldson said : `` H1N1 has been around a long time . 
It was a sub-type of the Spanish flu and is in our current seasonal flu vaccine . 
The optimistic interpretation is that the immune systems of the over-50s might have some memory of the H1N1 of this kind . '' 
He and Johnson defended their handling of the flu outbreak against critics who say it should be treated just like a mild seasonal flu , without school closures or the handout of antiviral drugs to contacts of those who are sick . 
`` We do n't know enough about the illness at this stage . 
It is very reassuring that cases so far are not worse . 
We do n't want a situation where a child is admitted to hospital because of the complications of flu . 
As far as children are concerned , I 'm very , very cautious . 
Simply to allow people to be exposed to it and develop antibodies I do n't think is the right approach . '' 
Johnson said he would rather have egg on his face than deaths on his hands . 
`` I 'd rather be accused of over-hyping something and exaggerating than not be prepared for a general pandemic that seriously affected our citizens , '' he said . 
The current strategy of containment justified using `` precious antiviral drugs '' , he said . 
If it became widespread or more severe , the strategy would change to reduce the numbers of people given drugs on a preventive basis . 
Patients and their family members would receive drugs , but not others who might have been in contact . 
School closures , on the advice of the Health Protection Agency , were a necessary part of the containment strategy . 
Johnson said the public response to the flu threat had been good , but `` now the danger is complacency '' . 
The government has ordered 227 million face masks and 34 respirators for health workers and has spent between # 400m and # 500m on its stockpile of flu drugs , which is being expanded to cover 80 % of the population from 50 % now ; # 100 million has been committed in contracts to drug companies Baxter and GlaxoSmithKline to produce a vaccine once the strain is understood .

2009-05-08,"cents Mapping of genetic code will aid creation of vaccine cents Five new cases diagnosed in the UK today Friday 8 May 2009 16.29 BST The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- today increased its global tally of confirmed swine flu cases to more than 2,300 , as British scientists announced they had worked out the full genetic code for the virus . 
Five new cases were diagnosed in the UK today four schoolchildren and an adult linked to Alleyn 's School in Dulwich , south London , which has been closed all week after six pupils were diagnosed with the illness . 
There are now 39 confirmed cases in the UK . 
Mexico remains the worst affected country , with more than 1,100 laboratory-confirmed human cases of H1N1 virus influenza , including 42 deaths . 
The United States has reported nearly 900 laboratory-confirmed human cases , including two deaths . 
Another 22 countries have confirmed cases but no deaths . 
The latest figures came as the health secretary , Alan Johnson , said the Health Protection Agency , which monitors infectious diseases , had fully mapped the genetic code of the virus . 
He said this would help scientists to understand how the virus operates and to identify the parts that can be used to manufacture a vaccine . 
On a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire , he was told that researchers hope European manufacturers will be able to take delivery of prototypes in the coming months to enable mass production of a vaccine to begin . 
Johnson said : `` A significant step towards protecting the world 's health against swine flu has been taken . 
We now look to the vaccine industry to produce the required quantities of vaccine as quickly as possible . '' 
The entire genetic fingerprint and sequence of the swine flu virus will now be analyzed to learn how the virus behaves as it infects individuals . 
At a meeting of Asian health ministers in Bangkok today , the WHO director general , Dr Margaret Chan , said the world was `` better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history '' , largely because of precautions taken over the threat of bird flu . 
She said : `` Years of alert and expectation mean that most countries now have preparedness plans . 
Vaccine manufacturing capacity has increased sharply . 
Large stocks of antiviral drugs have been produced and procured . 
`` Right now , treatment courses from the WHO stockpile are being shipped to more than 70 countries in the developing world . '' 
Mexico 's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva said he would raise concerns at the WHO annual meeting later this month about `` discriminatory '' measures imposed against the country , its people , and its exports because of the flu . 
China has placed dozens of Mexicans in forced quarantine as a protective measure against the spread of the virus . 
Around the world , public opinion seems to be shifting from fear of a pandemic to scepticism as to whether the virus poses a significant threat . 
Half of 2,000 Britons surveyed yesterday said they believe the government over-hyped the threat of swine flu , and are now less worried about it spreading . 
The research by online polling center Toluna found two-thirds of respondents thought the government had coped well with the outbreak , while more than half -LRB- 54 % -RRB- thought the NHS was well prepared to cope with a possible pandemic . 
The report noted a decline in public worry about the virus spreading , with 40 % worried about the virus , compared with 50 % last week . 
Public health officials around the world acknowledge their worst fears about the new virus have yet to materialise . 
But many experts worry that people will become too complacent and fail to heed warnings if the virus returns in a more dangerous form in the autumn . 
`` People are taking a sigh of relief too soon , '' said Dr Richard Besser , acting director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention . 
`` The measures we 've been talking about the importance of hand-washing , the importance of covering coughs , the real responsibility for staying home when you 're sick and keeping your children home when you 're sick I 'm afraid that people are going to say , ` Ah , we 've dodged a bullet . 
We do n't need to do that , ' '' he said .

2009-05-08,"cents First Asian case was traced to Hong Kong hotel cents Guests locked in for week tell of parties and romance Friday 8 May 2009 21.08 BST For many , it would have been the week from hell : nearly 300 strangers , trapped in a hotel at the center of one of the world 's most populous cities , with only TV and the fear of infectious disease to keep them occupied . 
But today , as 296 guests and employees were finally allowed to leave Hong Kong 's Metropark hotel , it emerged that the enforced quarantine had provided the setting for all-night drinking sessions and blossoming romance . 
At least two couples formed lasting relationships during their week-long incarceration , according to the South China Morning Post . 
One week after they were confined to the hotel where Asia 's first swine flu case was traced , the guests emerged clapping and cheering , discarding their face masks . 
A Korean businessman broke into song and hugged a policeman . 
`` I 'm happy ! 
I love Hong Kong people , '' he said . 
`` It 's nice to smell fresh air , '' added a British man who identified himself only as Matt . 
It was a marked contrast to the serious mood a week ago when the hotel was locked down after it emerged that a 25-year-old Mexican man who had contracted the H1N1 virus had stayed there . 
The man , who spent the week confined to hospital , was discharged last night . 
The decision to quarantine the hotel contributed to a diplomatic dispute between China and Mexico over Beijing 's handling of the virus . 
The Mexican president , Felipe Calder n , complained of a backlash against Mexicans abroad . 
Chinese authorities countered that their experience of the Sars outbreak had taught them to be cautious . 
Guests initially complained of being trapped . 
But they soon accepted their fate , and after fears about the severity of the virus subsided , spirits in the hotel began to lift . 
On Tuesday a birthday party for a French guest carried on into the small hours . 
`` They ended the night quite drunk , '' said Kevin Ireland , a businessman from New Delhi who wrote a daily blog of life inside the hotel . 
He claimed that the bill for wining and dining the guests for a week would be `` astronomical '' . 
After being released from the hotel , he said : `` We were treated very well . '' 
It was n't all fun and games . 
At least one woman caught in the quarantine was a prostitute who was forced to spend the entire week with her client after the management refused to give her a separate room , it was reported . 
The hotel is in Hong Kong 's Wanchai district , the setting of The World of Suzie Wong , a 1960 film about prostitution in the city , and the area is still said to be popular with visiting sailors . 
Hong Kong officials were keen to placate the hotel guests , who were given tickets to Hong Kong 's Disneyland , restaurant vouchers and film tickets . 
A picture posted on the Metropark 's Facebook page showed guests slipping notes into a tip box for the hotel staff . 
Hong Kong 's health minister , York Chow , was grateful to the guests . 
`` I want to thank them on behalf of all Hong Kong people for helping us ensure that Hong Kong is safe . '' 
Thomas Tsang , head of Hong Kong 's Centre for Health Protection , said officials would be reviewing their quarantine procedures .

2009-05-08,"Toyota Motor , the once-mighty money machine that grabbed the crown of world s biggest automaker from General Motors last year , gave a shocking loss forecast today for a staggering $ 8.6 billion for this year . 
Culprits are aplenty , but one of them is the company 's mammoth size . 
Until the economic crisis slammed the brakes on car sales last year , Toyota couldn t build them fast enough . 
To catch up with demand , Toyota put up more factories , from China to the Czech Republic . 
Reaching annual sales of 10 million vehicles a feat never achieved by any automaker to date -- looked imminent for the 70-year-old carmaker . 
Now that rapid expansion has come back to haunt it . 
With consumers holding back on car purchases the world over , Toyota s sprawling manufacturing facilities are a liability . 
Tumbling sales are forcing dozens of its factories to work half-days , costing the company billions . 
This year , it expects to build 6.3 million vehicles -- 800,000 fewer than it did in the year that ended on March 31 . 
Size is a tricky business . 
Economics says that scale breeds savings , but at the same time , it makes carmakers less nimble . 
Striking a balance can be tough even for a company like Toyota , which has grown organically as an independent carmaker . 
Rivals such as General Motors and Volkswagen , meanwhile , have become bigger partly by scooping up brands , often outside their home markets , so achieving synergies is even more difficult . 
In the late 1990s , former Daimler-Benz Chairman Juergen Schrempp had a vision of creating an auto empire and took over Chrysler to form DaimlerChrysler , which went on to buy stakes in Japan s Mitsubishi Motors and South Korea s Hyundai Motor . 
Now , all of those ties have effectively been severed . 
The moral of Schrempp s failure was : Size isn t the formula for success . 
It s puzzling , then , that Sergio Marchionne , the dynamic chief executive of Italy s Fiat , is treading a similar path . 
The Italian-Canadian CEO is looking to super-size Fiat by combining with the newly bankrupt Chrysler and GM s German arm , Opel , in the belief that the Italian carmaker needs the resulting industrial efficiency to survive . 
Toyota s announcement today should be a wake-up call for Mr Marchionne .

2009-05-08,"WASHINGTON | Fri May 8 , 2009 6:09 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. President Barack Obama will deliver a much anticipated speech to the Muslim world in Egypt next month , seeking to repair ties that were severely damaged under his predecessor George W. Bush . 
Many Arab and Muslim nations were angered by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo , abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Bush 's initial reluctance to pursue Israeli-Palestinian peace . 
Obama 's Egypt trip fulfills a promise he made during his presidential campaign to give a major address to Muslims from a Muslim capital during the first few months in office . 
The Muslim world will be watching to see his approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Most Muslims believed Bush 's policies toward the region were biased in favor of Israel . 
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters on Friday the speech would be delivered in Egypt on June 4 but did not say whether it would be in the Egyptian capital Cairo . 
The country has been a key partner for Washington in decades of efforts to secure Middle East peace and is one of the biggest recipients of U.S. military and economic aid . 
But the choice of Egypt , which has a poor human rights record , could potentially overshadow the substance of Obama 's speech , and Gibbs found himself on the defensive over the issue at a White House news conference . 
`` It is a country that in many ways represents the heart of the Arab world , '' Gibbs said . 
`` The scope of the speech , the desire for the president to speak -LRB- to the Muslim world -RRB- , is bigger than where the speech was going to be given or who 's the leadership of the country where the speech is going to be given , '' he said . 
Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice gave a major policy speech in Egypt in 2005 at a time when U.S. popularity was seriously dented by the Iraq war . 
Rice 's speech was part of the Bush administration 's `` democracy agenda . '' 
She urged reforms across the region , specifically targeting her host , which drew anger from Cairo . 
However , the new U.S. administration has dropped the previous government 's focus on building democracy and Obama 's speech will likely be more conciliatory . 
The government of President Hosni Mubarak , who is due to visit Washington later this month , has been increasingly bold in targeting its foes in recent years , arresting leftists and Islamists alike . 
Press freedoms remain limited and protesters have largely been scared off the streets . 
The Egyptian government released opposition politician Ayman Nour in February , a move seen as trying to win goodwill from the new Obama administration . 
Nour spent three years in jail on forgery charges he says were fabricated to punish him for challenging Mubarak . 
Egypt says its courts are fair . 
Human rights group Amnesty International has raised concerns about what it describes as systematic torture , deaths of prisoners in custody , unfair trials and arrests of people for their political and religious beliefs or for their sexual orientation , The group said it had no problem with Obama 's choice of Egypt but stressed the U.S. leader should use the speech as a platform to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and human rights concerns in the Muslim world . 
`` I would say speak about his commitment to being fair on the Israeli-Palestinian issue and talk about the importance of free speech and assembly in the Arab and Muslim world , which unfortunately are very low , '' said Zahir Janmohamed , Amnesty 's advocacy director for the Middle East . 
`` If he does n't address either of them , it will be a disappointment , '' he said . 
Shortly after his inauguration on January 20 , Obama chose an Arab station , Al Arabiya , to give his first formal TV interview , widely interpreted as a signal that he wanted to improve relations with the Arab and Muslim world . 
He also called for peace and dialogue with Islam in a speech to Turkey 's parliament on his first presidential visit to the Muslim world in April . 
Gibbs said on Friday that `` all of this gives the president the opportunity hopefully to extend the hand to those that in many ways are like us but simply have a different religion . '' 
During the same trip , Obama will also go to the German city of Dresden and the Buchenwald concentration camp complex , which was set up by the Nazis during World War Two , Gibbs said . 
On June 6 , Obama would travel to Normandy in France to attend events marking the 65th anniversary of the D-Day landings by Allied forces that led to the end of the war .

2009-05-08,"\* Sees 2009 profits ` substantially less ' than previous view \* Says all other businesses performing in line \* Shares slump 30 percent -LRB- Recasts lead , adds share price , CEO , analyst comment -RRB- LONDON , May 8 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Emerging markets lender International Personal Finance -LRB- IPF . 
L -RRB- said soaring loan default rates in recession-hit Hungary would eat into its profits this year , knocking almost a third off the company 's share price . 
IPF , which offers small loans to consumers in central Europe , Romania and Mexico , risked breaching its debt covenants if loan impairment rates worsened further , an analyst said , but the firm 's CEO denied this would happen . 
`` It is likely , as a result of the underperformance in Hungary , that the -LRB- profit -RRB- outcome for 2009 will be substantially less than our expectations , '' the company said on Friday . 
Impairments in the country rose sharply in the first four months of the year , causing it to miss pretax profit targets by 8 million pounds . 
Hungary 's government expects the economy , which has been hit by falling exports and weakening domestic demand , to contract by up to 6 percent this year , while the forint currency has fallen sharply in the past six months , making it harder for local borrowers to repay loans taken out in hard currencies . 
Analyst Nitin Arora at Noble said his clients had `` lost faith '' in IPF 's management team , and he believed bad loans as a proportion of the firm 's loan portfolio had risen to 31 percent . 
`` We estimate that if that ratio goes to 34 percent , they will breach the interest covenants , '' he said . 
`` Given the deteriorating macro environment and the uncertainty in all the economies in which IPF operates , we would not be surprised to see the 34 percent being hit . '' 
IPF , which closed its Russian operations at the end of April , said it experienced a sharp downturn in loan collections in Poland , Czech Republic , Slovakia and Hungary , as the global recession hits consumers and unemployment rises . 
But Chief Executive John Harnett told Reuters he did not expect impairments to rise to 34 percent and the firm would continue to operate within its covenants . 
He said that , after a lull at the start of the year , collections in its largest markets of Poland and the Czech Republic improved in March and April , a trend that was set to continue for the rest of the year . 
Rates had stabilised in Hungary , albeit at a low level . 
`` We 've seen off the worst , '' he said . 
IPF , which split from UK parent Provident Financial -LRB- PFG . 
L -RRB- in July 2007 , said its operations in Mexico had not been affected by the outbreak of swine flu and it was still on track to break into profit there for the first time . 
Shares in IPF , which two months ago reported a 40 percent rise in full-year pretax profit , tumbled 31 percent to 98.5 pence at 1304 GMT , having hit a record low of 94 pence at the start of April .

2009-05-10,"World Health Organisation reveals figures as health officials announce America 's third death from disease Sunday 10 May 2009 14.27 BST The US has more confirmed cases of swine flu than any other country , the World Health Organisation said as health officials announced the country 's third death from the disease today . 
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- reported 2,254 confirmed cases across the US , and the deputy director for science and public health , Anne Schuchat , warned that the total could be an underestimate . 
`` Today there are almost 3,000 probable and confirmed cases here in the United States , '' she said . 
`` The good news is we are not seeing a rise above the epidemic threshold . '' 
The US department of health said a man in Washington state with H1N1 influenza died last week . 
Officials said the man , in his 30s , had underlying heart conditions and viral pneumonia , but that swine flu was considered to have been a factor in his death . 
Mary Selecky , Washington state 's secretary of health , said : `` We urge people to take this outbreak very seriously . '' 
Although most cases appear to be mild , the virus has put 104 people across the US in hospital . 
Forty-eight people have died of the virus in Mexico where there have now been 1,626 confirmed cases and new deaths have also been recorded in Canada and Costa Rica . 
The death of a 53-year-old man in Costa Rica yesterday was the first involving swine flu outside North America . 
The man had from diabetes and chronic lung disease , the country 's health ministry said . 
Canadian officials said a woman who died there also had other health problems , but gave no further details . 
Nine new cases of swine flu have been confirmed in the UK eight in England and one more in Scotland bringing the total to 48 . 
A Department of Health spokeswoman said one of the three new adult cases was linked to travel to Mexico , while six children infected all attended the same school .

2009-05-10,"By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Sun May 10 , 2009 2:51 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Washington state man with H1N1 influenza died last week , health officials said , the third U.S. sufferer to die as the new flu strain confirmed in more than 2,200 Americans appeared in Japan and Australia . 
Health officials have warned that the true number of cases may be underestimated . 
Although most cases appear to be mild , the new swine flu strain has killed just as seasonal flu does . 
Another 48 people have died in Mexico and one each in Canada and Costa Rica . 
Washington state officials said on Saturday a man in his 30s with underlying heart conditions died last week , state governor Chris Gregoire describing his death as `` a sobering reminder that influenza is serious . '' 
The virus has moved into the southern hemisphere , where influenza season is just beginning , and could mix with circulating seasonal flu viruses or the H5N1 avian influenza virus to create new strains , health officials said . 
`` One of the big challenges with influenza viruses is the way that they change , the way they combine and their prevalence in a number of species , '' Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a news briefing on Saturday . 
`` This is why it is so important for countries to have a strong capacity to deal with influenza and also why it is very important to understand what happens at the interface between people and animals . '' 
Before the Washington man 's death was announced , the CDC reported 2,254 confirmed U.S. cases of the virus with 104 people in hospital , up from 1,639 cases previously . 
`` Today there are almost 3,000 probable and confirmed cases here in the United States , '' Schuchat said . 
`` The good news is we are not seeing a rise above the epidemic threshold . '' 
Japan reported four cases , and globally officials reported more than 4,200 people in 30 countries had been ill . 
Australia reported its first case , a woman who been traveling in the United States but officials said she had made full recovery . 
`` We think this virus is in most of the United States , '' Schuchat said . 
`` The individual numbers are likely to be a very great underestimate . '' 
More Americans are seeing doctors for influenza-like illnesses at a time of year when such visits usually decline . 
Schuchat said tests showed they do not all have the new H1N1 virus . 
Many have seasonal flu -- the H1N1 seasonal strain , the H3N2 seasonal strain and influenza B -- and other infections . 
Seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people globally and infects up to a third of the population each year . 
Health experts have not openly criticized efforts by other countries to stop the virus from getting in -- most notably China and its territory of Hong Kong , which have quarantined travellers in contact with patients . 
A spokeswoman in Hong Kong said on Saturday that a Mexican traveler confirmed as Hong Kong 's first and only case of the new flu strain had been discharged from hospital . 
The unidentified man , who unwittingly caused the confinement of almost 300 guests and staff at a Hong Kong hotel where he had stayed , had been in hospital for a week . 
China put seven people who had been exposed to three Japanese passengers diagnosed with the H1N1 flu in quarantine , the official Xinhua news agency quoted the government as saying . 
Mexican health ministry spokesman Carlos Olmos said the government was testing thousands of samples to confirm which patients with severe respiratory symptoms were actually infected with the flu . 
He said more than 5,000 tests had been done on suspected cases and that 1,578 people were ill but were being treated . 
After the virus was identified on April 23 , Mexico banned public events and shut schools , bars , restaurants and many businesses to prevent people from gathering . 
Officials say disinfection of public spaces has helped control its spread . 
Schools in the capital will reopen on Monday . 
But the state government of Jalisco , home to Mexico 's second-largest city Guadalajara , said schools , nightclubs and theaters there will remain shut for another week after three suspected flu deaths . 
Schuchat said it is not yet clear whether some measures taken have slowed the outbreak , but she said it was clear that early detection methods had alerted the world quickly . 
She noted that the AIDS virus , which has now killed 25 million people globally and infects 33 million , spread for years before it was even identified . 
`` If we end up having a bad pandemic of influenza from this strain we would have had a real jump-start on things like vaccines , '' she said .

2009-05-10,"\* 4,379 people infected with H1N1 flu in 29 countries \* Big increase in confirmed cases in United States \* First death reported in Costa Rica ZURICH , May 10 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - H1N1 flu has infected 4,379 people in 29 countries , the World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- said on Sunday , increasing its count by almost a thousand in a day . 
The WHO tally tends to lag national reports but is considered more definitive . 
The U.N. agency said Mexico has reported 1,626 confirmed cases , up from 1,364 on Saturday , and repeated that 45 people have died there from the new flu strain that is a genetic mixture of swine , bird and human viruses . 
The Mexican government has said the worst is over and eased restrictions on commercial and public activity in the country that has been at the epicentre of the outbreak . 
The WHO 's latest flu tally increased the number of confirmed infections in the United States to 2,254 from 1,639 reported on Saturday , while the number of reported deaths remained at two . 
U.S. officials on Saturday said a man died from the new flu in Washington state last week , bringing the toll in the United States to three . 
WHO increased the number of infections in Canada to 280 , from 242 , and repeated one person had died there . 
It said one person had also died in Costa Rica , which had eight confirmed cases . 
European countries with cases confirmed in WHO laboratories include Spain -LRB- 93 -RRB- , Britain -LRB- 39 -RRB- , Germany -LRB- 11 -RRB- , Italy -LRB- 9 -RRB- , France -LRB- 12 -RRB- , Portugal -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Ireland -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Netherlands -LRB- 3 -RRB- , Austria -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Denmark -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Sweden -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Switzerland -LRB- 1 -RRB- and Poland -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 
The WHO also confirmed the following infections in the rest of the world : Israel -LRB- 7 -RRB- , New Zealand -LRB- 7 -RRB- , Brazil -LRB- 6 -RRB- , Japan -LRB- 4 -RRB- , Panama -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 
South Korea -LRB- 3 -RRB- , El Salvador -LRB- 2 -RRB- , Hong Kong , China -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Guatemala -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Colombia -LRB- 1 -RRB- Argentina -LRB- 1 -RRB- and Australia -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 
Evidence that the disease , popularly known as swine flu , has taken hold in communities outside the Americas would prompt WHO Director-General Margaret Chan to declare a full pandemic . 
Chan raised the global pandemic alert level last week to 5 out of 6 in response to the spread of H1N1 flu . 
Phase 5 means a pandemic is imminent . 
The WHO also repeated its guidance that international travel should not be restricted as a result of the outbreak .

2009-05-10,"Is South America better off without Mexican clubs ? 
Mexican clubs have stormed out of the South American Libertadores Cup after a row over the H1N1 flu outbreak and the national side will no longer take part at the Copa America . 
`` The game is over for us , '' said Justino Compean , president of the Mexican Football Federation -LRB- FMF -RRB- . 
Mexican authorities threw their toys out of the pram after Brazilian champions Sao Paulo and Uruguay 's Nacional declined to travel to the country to face Guadalajara and San Luis respectively in the Libertadores Cup second round . 
Yet , the weekend 's league matches in both Guadalajara and San Luis were played behind closed doors under the orders of the FMF itself because both are considered to be in regions where there is thought to be a higher risk of the virus . 
Given the circumstances , it seemed premature , to say the least , to claim that either city would make an appropriate venue for an international sporting fixture . 
Some commentators , notably David Faitelson writing for the Mexican edition of ESPN 's Web site , have questioned whether any football at all should be played in Mexico in the present circumstances . 
`` Has anyone asked the players what they think ? '' 
Most media have reported matches as if almost nothing unusual was going on -- either this weekend , when clubs in some regions were allowed to admit fans under strict conditions , or the previous one , when all games were played behind closed doors . 
There is also the matter of Mexico 's uncomfortable relationship with the South American confederation . 
Mexican clubs have been taking part in the Libertadores , the regions 's equivalent of the Champions League , for more than a decade under a special agreement . 
They also play in the Copa Sudamericana , a sort of UEFA Cup-type contest , and the national team has been a guest at the Copa America since 1993 . 
But it has never been the happiest of relationships . 
Mexican officials and media often complain that their teams have received second class treatment at the hands of referees and disciplinary commissions , yet there is also the feeling that the Mexicans only take the Libertadores seriously when it suits them . 
The Mexicans have repeatedly failed to send their top clubs to the Libertadores , instead organising an `` Interliga '' tournament , involving eight teams and played in the United States , to decide who qualifies . 
This frequently results in midtable teams representing the country , making a mockery of the Libertadores . 
Two years ago , Mexican club America fielded a reserve team in their quarter-final tie against Brazil 's Santos because of a clash with local matches , which the FMF refused to re-scheduled . 
A greater insult to their hosts would have been harder to imagine . 
Perhaps Mexico s withdrawal will be cheered by much of the continent .

REUTERS\/Henry Romero Obviously you do n't know anything about soccer . 
Only Brazilian teams and a couple of teams in Argentina could be considered superior . 
It is mostly because of the infrastructure of the Mexican Soccer Federation . 
Without Mexico they have no money , read the news , the Conmebol is asking Mexico to reconsider its position . 
All the companies that are willing to put money into the Copa libertadores do it because of the Mexican teams . 
Maybe you do n't agree but it is the truth . 
They are not doing any favor to Mexico . 
Libertadores is the most boring tournament in soccer . 
Mexico , Argentina and Brazil are the only countries with leagues big enough to send more than two competitive teams to the Libertadores . 
Without Mexico the tournament will be even more boring than usual . 
As far as Mexican soccer goes , they pay European salaries to mediocre players and Mexican fans are too stupid to realize it . . 
or they just do n't care . 
Rome had bread and circuses , Mexico has cheap beer and soccer . 
Check out the FIFA club rankings and you will see that Mexiaco 's top clubs rarely break the top 35 in the world . 
Trust me the argentinian and brasilian leagues are the most competives besides if you knew about football , then you \ 'd realize mexico isnt even supposed to go in the Libertadores cup . 
there just invited since the other teams are way to damn pathetic to even pass the first round . 
also Libertadores isn \ ' t the most boring tournament in football , way better than the MLS and is equaled only by the Champions league in Europe . 
The only reason its not well known is that they \ 're from south america and whatever is from there or any other country in the world except USA and Europe is considered mediocre .

2009-05-10,"Sun May 10 , 2009 4:12 pm EDT CAIRO May 10 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A five-year-old Egyptian girl has contracted the highly pathogenic bird flu virus after coming into contact with infected birds , the state news agency MENA reported on Sunday . 
The case brings to 69 the number of people confirmed to have contracted the H5N1 avian influenza virus in Egypt , which has been hit harder than any another country outside Asia . 
While the avian influenza virus rarely infects people , experts say they fear it could mutate into a form people could easily pass to one another , sparking a pandemic that could kill millions . 
MENA , citing the Health Ministry , said the girl from Sohag province was admitted to hospital on Saturday . 
It said she was being treated with the anti-viral drug Tamiflu and was in a stable condition . 
Some 26 Egyptians have died after contracting the virus . 
Most of those infected had come into contact with infected domestic birds in a country where roughly 5 million households depend on domestically raised poultry as a significant source of food and income . 
Last month , Egypt ordered the culling of all the country 's 300,000 to 400,000 pigs as a precaution against the new H1N1 influenza strain , also known as swine flu . 
The World Health Organisation on Sunday reported 4,379 people in 29 countries have been infected by the new virus . 
No cases have been reported in Egypt .

2009-05-11,"Swine flu found on China mainland People in China are taking no chances in the fight against H1N1 China has confirmed the first case of swine flu on the Chinese mainland , and is searching for people who could have been in contact with the infected man . 
The 30-year-old student , who has been named only as Mr Bao , had recently flown into the country from the US . 
The authorities say he traveled from St Louis to Tokyo , then to Beijing and finally landed in Chengdu on Saturday . 
Earlier this month China diagnosed a case of the H1N1 virus in a Mexican traveller in Hong Kong . 
Mr Bao has now been transferred to an infectious diseases hospital in Chengdu , according to state media . 
The Chinese Ministry of Health says it has asked authorities across the country to track down anyone who may have come into contact with the patient on his journey . 
About 130 people from the patient 's flight to Chengdu have already been quarantined , state media says . 
In the past , China has been accused of not doing enough to combat the spread of diseases , especially the 2003 outbreak of Sars . 
This time the government has acted quickly and decisively , but some of its measures have been criticised as excessive . 
Anyone who came into contact with the Mexican traveller who was diagnosed in Hong Kong was put into isolation for seven days . 
Hundreds of Mexicans have been quarantined in China , and the Mexican government said some were singled out solely on their nationality , when there was no chance they could have been in contact with the virus .

2009-05-11,"Patient developed symptoms on domestic flight from Beijing to Chengdu , in Sichuan , after traveling from the US Monday 11 May 2009 13.41 BST A student recently returned from the US has become mainland China 's first confirmed case of swine flu , prompting the Chinese authorities to try to quarantine all those who shared a flight with him . 
The 30-year-old patient , who has been named only as Bao , tested positive for the type-A H1N1 virus . 
Up to 130 passengers who shared flights with the infected man are in isolation , the state news agency Xinhua reported , with authorities sending text messages to mobile phones nationwide asking those who had been on board the flights to report to the disease prevention bureau . 
Bao arrived in Beijing on Friday having traveled home from America via Tokyo . 
He developed symptoms on a domestic flight from Beijing to Chengdu , in Sichuan , the health ministry said . 
He went to hospital and was transferred to the city 's infectious disease hospital after being found `` weakly positive '' for swine flu . 
The country 's only previous confirmed case was a Mexican man who had traveled to Hong Kong . 
Visa agents and the official Chinese visa service in the UK said people who had just visited Canada , Spain , Mexico or the US would have to wait seven days before applying for a Chinese visa . 
But a foreign ministry press officer in Beijing said he was unaware of such a policy , and that any such change in procedure would have been announced . 
Deng Haihua , a health ministry spokesman , told reporters that of the 233 people on board the flight from Tokyo , 106 were foreigners ; roughly a quarter of them were Japanese . 
All but one of the passengers on the Beijing-Chengdu flight were from mainland China , Deng said . 
`` The local health authorities are doing their utmost now to try to track down these passengers , '' he said . 
China has been accused in the past of not acting quickly enough to combat the spread of diseases , especially during the 2003 global outbreak of Sars . 
The Chinese authorities , chastened by that experience , have been accused of overreactingn to swine flu . 
China 's response has drawn complaints from Mexico that its citizens were quarantined on the basis of their nationality alone . 
The World Health Organisation today confirmed that the virus has infected a total of 4,379 people across the world . 
Its official tally , which tends to lag behind national reports but is also held to be more secure , includes 45 deaths in the disease epicentre , Mexico , two deaths in the US , and one each in Canada and Costa Rica .

2009-05-11,"WASHINGTON | Mon May 11 , 2009 5:40 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A new gene map of Mexicans show they are as diverse as their history suggests and could benefit from having their own , unique analysis when it comes to testing drugs and assessing disease risks , researchers reported on Monday . 
They studied 300 mestizos -- people of mixed ethnic heritage -- and found many different genetic variations that pointed to Indian , European and African ancestry . 
They also compared these sequences to those found among 30 ethnic Indians . 
`` This study makes clear that Latin Americans with mixed ancestry are different enough from other people worldwide that a full-scale genomic mapping project would be wise both scientifically and economically , '' said Dr. Julio Frenk of the Harvard School of Public Health , a former Mexican minister of health . 
`` It would allow doctors to analyze fewer genetic markers when diagnosing the risk that a patient will develop a disease that depends on complex factors . '' 
Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers said they found 89 common gene variations that could not be found in the so-called HapMap Project -- an international collaboration cataloging genetic similarities and differences among human beings . 
`` This effort will contribute to the design of better strategies aimed at characterizing the genetic factors underlying common complex diseases in Mexicans , '' wrote Gerardo Jimenez-Sanchez and colleagues at Mexico 's National Institute of Genomic Medicine . 
`` In addition , this information will increase our knowledge of genomic variability in Latino populations . '' 
The findings apply more broadly than only Mexico , Jimenez-Sanchez and colleagues said . 
`` More than 560 million people live in Latin American countries , and according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population reached 45.5 million in 2007 , representing the largest and fastest-growing minority group in the United States , '' they wrote . 
The study may shed light on why the new H1N1 swine flu virus killed so many people in Mexico -- 56 , at last count , compared to three in the United States and one in Canada . 
`` It is not possible today to say genetic variation is responsible for the unique H1N1 influenza A mortality rate in Mexico , '' Jimenez-Sanchez said in a statement . 
`` However , knowledge of genomic variability in the Mexican population can allow the identification of genetic variations that confer susceptibility to common diseases , including infections such as the flu . ''

2009-05-11,"Mon May 11 , 2009 2:06 pm EDT LONDON May 11 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Thai scientists who infected piglets with the new H1N1 virus spreading around the world said on Monday the strain caused flu-like symptoms in the animals before disappearing , just like many of the human cases . 
An outbreak of the new strain , known as swine flu , that has killed at least 53 people -- mainly in Mexico -- has prompted some countries to ban pork from countries reporting human cases , even though officials have said there is no risk of spreading the virus by eating pork . 
However , some pork producers are unsure how the virus could affect their animals . 
The 22 piglets infected with the new virus showed flu-like symptoms between one and four days after infection and were shedding virus -- meaning they could spread it -- two days after infection , the researchers said . 
None of the animals , also infected with the less dangerous H3N2 subtype , died , Roongroje Thanawongnuwech and colleagues from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok reported . 
`` The results of this study may assist in the prevention and control of swine influenza virus in Thailand , '' the researchers wrote in BioMed Central 's Virology Journal . 
The new virus is a complex mix of swine viruses with avian and human bits , though nobody knows exactly where the new infection that first emerged in Mexico originated . 
Influenza viruses mutate constantly and they also swap genetic material with one another promiscuously , especially if an animal or person is infected with two strains at once . 
The team found that all infected pigs developed respiratory symptoms such as nasal discharge , coughing , sneezing and conjunctivitis . 
They also developed lung lesions large enough to be seen by the naked eye . 
The lesions were characterised by dark plum-coloured , areas on the lung and were most severe two days after infection . 
This was especially the case in the H1N1-infected pigs , where about a third of the lung was covered . 
`` The results demonstrated that both swine flu subtypes were able to induce flu-like symptoms and lung lesions in weanling pigs . 
However the severity of the disease with regard to both gross and microscopic lung lesions was greater in the H1N1-infected pigs , '' Thanawongnuwech said in a statement .

2009-05-11,"By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Mon May 11 , 2009 7:45 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new strain of H1N1 flu that has killed 56 people in Mexico and has been carried around the world by travelers acts more like a pandemic strain than regular seasonal flu , researchers reported on Monday . 
They said it was transmitted more easily and affects young adults more often than annual flu strains , justifying the World Health Organization 's stepped-up level of pandemic alert , currently a 5 , one step down from a full pandemic . 
As many as 23,000 Mexicans were likely infected with the swine flu virus , Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London and colleagues reported in the journal Science . 
They also found evidence to support the theory that the outbreak originated in the village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz , which had been the subject of intense speculation . 
`` The dating -LRB- of the outbreak -RRB- was consistent with that , '' Christophe Fraser of Imperial College London said in a telephone interview . 
The World Health Organization Rapid Pandemic Assessment Collaboration looked at both the pattern of disease spread and the early genetic analysis of the virus . 
`` I think the most important thing we found was the rate of spread and the extent of spread is similar to what has been seen in previous pandemics , '' Fraser added . 
`` Our estimates suggest that 23,000 individuals had been infected in Mexico by late April , giving an estimated case fatality ratio of 0.4 percent based on confirmed and suspect deaths reported to that time , '' they wrote . 
`` Thus while substantial uncertainty remains , clinical severity appears less than that seen in 1918 but comparable with that seen in 1957 . '' 
The 1918 pandemic was the worst of the 20th century , killing anywhere between 25 million and 100 million people , depending on estimates . 
It was the first appearance of the H1N1 virus . 
The 1957 pandemic of H2N2 killed an estimated 2 million people globally . 
Seasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people annually with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent . 
Looking at the pattern in La Gloria , the researchers said it looked as if the virus was transmitted human to human over 14 to 73 generations -- meaning one person infected another , who infected another , up to 73 times . 
`` Transmissibility is therefore substantially higher than seasonal flu , '' they wrote . 
The first case was seen in La Gloria around February 15 , they wrote , citing reports and not hard evidence . 
But quick genetic analysis suggests the virus may have first infected someone around January 12 . 
`` As the epidemic spreads further , it is likely that severity will vary from country to country depending on health care resources and the public health measures adopted to mitigate impact , '' they added . 
Globally , WHO has confirmed 4,694 infections in 30 countries . 
Sixty deaths have been confirmed , most in Mexico with three in the United States and one in Canada . 
While it is widespread across the United States , WHO said the new H1N1 virus shows no signs of sustained person-to-person spread outside of North America .

2009-05-12,"People in Mexico have been wearing masks as a precaution A third of the world 's population could be infected with swine flu , expert projections suggest . 
Researchers say swine flu has `` full pandemic potential '' , spreading readily between people and is likely to go global in the next six to nine months . 
Although one in three who come in contact will likely become infected , the Imperial College London team declined to estimate the death toll . 
The study based on Mexico 's experience is published in the journal Science . 
The number of laboratory-confirmed swine flu cases has reached 5,251 in some 30 countries around the world , with 61 having died from the disease , the World Health Organization has confirmed . 
Working in collaboration with the WHO and public health agencies in Mexico , the researchers assessed the Mexico epidemic using data to the end of April and taking into account factors like international spread and viral genetic diversity . 
Lead researcher Professor Neil Ferguson said it was too early to say whether the virus will cause deaths on a massive scale , or prove little more lethal than normal seasonal flu . 
His `` fast and dirty '' analysis of Mexico 's swine flu outbreak suggests that the H1N1 virus is about as dangerous as the virus behind a 1957 pandemic that killed 2 million people worldwide . 
But it 's not nearly as lethal as the bug that caused the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , which caused an estimated 50 million deaths in 1918 . 
Its full impact on the UK is not likely to be known until the annual flu season in the autumn and winter , when a `` really major epidemic '' can be expected in the northern hemisphere , says Professor Ferguson . 
Prof Ferguson , who sits on the World Health Organisation 's emergency committee for the outbreak , told the BBC Radio 4 Today program : `` This virus really does have full pandemic potential . 
It is likely to spread around the world in the next six to nine months and when it does so it will affect about one-third of the world 's population . 
`` To put that into context , normal seasonal flu every year probably affects around 10 % of the world 's population every year , so we are heading for a flu season which is perhaps three times worse than usual - not allowing for whether this virus is more severe than normal seasonal flu viruses . '' 
His study suggests swine flu could kill four in every 1,000 infected people . 
Professor Ferguson said his findings confirmed that decisions must be taken swiftly on vaccine production . 
`` We really need to be prepared , particularly for the autumn . 
At the moment , the virus is not spreading fast in the northern hemisphere , because we are outside the normal flu season , but come the autumn it is likely to cause a really major epidemic . 
`` One of the key decisions which has to be made this week by the world community is how much do we switch over current vaccine production for seasonal flu to make a vaccine against this particular virus ? 
I think those decisions need to be made quickly . ''

2009-05-12,"Swine flu could affect third of world 's population , says study Researchers say swine flu will spread around world within nine months , as UK confirms three more cases Tuesday 12 May 2009 16.36 BST The swine flu virus will infect a third of the world 's population if it continues to spread at its current rate , scientists warned today , as three more cases were confirmed in the UK . 
In what the journal Science described as the `` first quick and dirty analysis '' of swine flu , a study by researchers at Imperial College London predicted the virus was likely to cause an epidemic in the northern hemisphere in the autumn . 
One of the authors , the epidemiologist and disease modeller Neil Ferguson , who sits on the World Health Organisation 's emergency committee for the outbreak , said the virus had `` full pandemic potential '' . 
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Today program , he said : `` It is likely to spread around the world in the next six to nine months , and when it does so , it will affect about one-third of the world 's population . 
`` To put that into context , normal seasonal flu probably affects around 10 % of the world 's population every year , so we are heading for a flu season which is perhaps three times worse than usual not allowing for whether this virus is more severe than normal seasonal flu viruses . '' 
The Health Protection Agency announced three more confirmed cases of the virus in the UK , bringing the total to 68 . 
The three patients two children and one adult from London all had close contact with previously confirmed cases . 
Today 's study estimated the contagiousness of the disease by analyzing the number of people traveling to Mexico who became infected , and comparing that with a study of a Mexican village where the disease has spread . 
The research also examined how the virus was mutating . 
It estimated that swine flu had killed between 0.4 % and 1.4 % of its victims in Mexico . 
The report 's lead author , Christophe Fraser , said it was too early to predict what the death rate was likely to be outside Mexico . 
`` My hunch is that the death rate will be lower elsewhere Mexico has underlying issues with respiratory disease , '' he said . 
The researchers said this H1N1 virus appeared to be about equal in severity to the flu of 1957 , and less severe than the deadly 1918 version . 
`` At the moment the virus is not spreading fast in the northern hemisphere because we are outside the normal flu season , but come the autumn it is likely to cause a really major epidemic , '' Ferguson said . 
He declined to put an estimate on the number of deaths that may occur . 
`` We have some assessment , but the uncertainty is still quite broad , '' he said . 
`` We can say it is not going to be as catastrophic as the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 , it is milder than that . 
But it is still possible it could be -LRB- like -RRB- 1957 where about three to four out of 1,000 people who were infected died and overall about 3 million to 4 million people died that year because of the pandemic worldwide or it could be even milder than that , like the 1968 pandemic which was barely worse than a normal seasonal flu year . 
`` I am not predicting three million to four million -LRB- deaths -RRB- . 
That was what happened in 1957 . 
The world is a very different place today . 
There are more people in the world , but there is also a much better healthcare system . 
We have drugs and vaccines , particularly in developed countries , which should markedly reduce the burdens of the disease . '' 
Ferguson said the findings of the study confirmed that decisions must be taken swiftly on vaccine production . 
`` One of the key decisions which has to be made this week by the world community is how much do we switch over current vaccine production for seasonal flu to make a vaccine against this particular virus . '' 
Today Cuba and Thailand confirmed their first case of the virus . 
The patient in Cuba is a Mexican student at a medical school . 
Fidel Castro accused Mexico of failing to disclose the spread of swine flu until after Barack Obama , the US president , had visited the country on 16 April . 
In a newspaper column , the former Cuban leader wrote : `` Mexican authorities did not inform the world of the presence -LRB- of swine flu -RRB- , while they waited for Obama 's visit . '' 
At least 61 people have been killed by swine flu around the world , and the WHO has confirmed about 4,800 cases .

2009-05-12,"HONG KONG | Tue May 12 , 2009 7:58 am EDT HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The next time you cough or sneeze , there is good reason to cover your mouth . 
As many as 20,000 viruses are expelled in an average cough , which may be sufficient to infect many people -- particularly those who are not vaccinated . 
Julian Tang , a consultant at Singapore 's National University Hospital 's Division of Microbiology , said as many as 3,000 tiny droplets are produced in a standard cough . 
Using previous research on influenza viral loads in nasal secretions , and assuming that each coughed airborne droplet measures between 1 to 5 micrometers in diameter , that adds up to many , many viruses in a single cough . 
A micrometer , or micron , is one millionth of a meter , or one thousandth of a millimeter . 
`` Based on this research and assuming about 3,000 droplets are produced per cough , this range of influenza viruses produced per cough is about 195 to 19,500 , '' Tang told Reuters . 
He added that this figure of 3,000 droplets refers to those that remain suspended in the air for considerable periods -- long enough to infect people . 
`` This -LRB- 3,000 -RRB- is also the number of droplets estimated to remain suspended in air for long periods -- so-called droplet nuclei . 
Larger droplets carrying influenza viruses may also be produced during a cough , but these will fall to the ground relatively quickly and will no longer be considered to be significant in the airborne transmission of influenza , '' he said . 
With a new H1N1 influenza virus spreading around the world , governments in many countries have revived advertisements entreating people to observe personal hygiene . 
In Indonesia , a slick TV advertisement features a young woman remonstrating a suitor at a village sing-a-long , telling him to get to a health clinic because `` that 's not a normal cough . '' 
Aimed at the poorly-educated masses , the adverts are set to a dangdut -LRB- traditional pop music -RRB- theme and feature an easy-to-remember slogan and theme song . 
However , experts are uncertain as to what constitutes an infective dose when it comes to influenza viruses . 
But as a guide , previous research has found that it takes just one to 10 organisms to cause viral hemorrhagic fevers , and 10 to 100 organisms to cause viral encephalitis . 
Tang said an infective dose of flu virus would depend on a variety of factors , such as the constitution of people breathing in these droplets and whether they had been vaccinated . 
`` It is difficult to give an exact number for the infectious dose -- and this may even differ for the same individual throughout the year . 
But probably for immune people , the infectious dose will be higher than for non-immune people -- hence , the benefits of vaccination , '' Tang said . 
`` Those previously vaccinated or naturally infected to the same or similar virus can develop a rapid antibody response and clear the virus in the respiratory tract before the virus can take hold and cause disease . '' '' 
-LRB- But -RRB- even immune hosts may develop symptoms if the viral load exposure is sufficiently high , '' he added . 
Doctors say most airborne flu transmissions occur within a one meter range , although it can also be transmitted by direct contact with contaminated objects , like toys . 
`` Wearing masks may well help to reduce the transmission of these infections , as well as covering the mouth with your hand or a tissue when coughing or sneezing -- simply by using a barrier to prevent dissemination of the virus , '' Tang said .

PA -RRB- is spending 350 million euros -LRB- $ 480 million -RRB- to build a site to produce a potential blockbuster dengue vaccine that is still in development . 
Sanofi has stressed the importance of vaccines for its growth as the high level of research and development makes it hard for generic drugmakers to launch cheaper copies . 
Vaccines take up 35 percent of Sanofi 's recently trimmed drug portfolio . 
`` What is the potential success rate -LRB- of the candidate vaccine reaching the market -RRB- ? 
We presume 70 percent chance that clinical trials will lead to a vaccine , '' chief executive Chris Viehbacher said at a news conference . 
`` It 's a major commitment for us . '' 
The new vaccine production center is the largest industrial investment ever made by Sanofi-Aventis , the world 's fourth biggest drugmaker and biggest maker of human vaccines through its Sanofi Pasteur vaccines division . 
The high-technology site should be up and running in 2013 to produce 100 million doses of the dengue vaccine which should become availabe in 2014 in the endemic regions such as Asia Pacific . 
Sanofi has said the preventative jab could generate sales of at least 1 billion euros a year as the tropical disease is spreading and putting two fifths of the world 's population at risk , according to the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- . 
The new plant will be located in Neuville-sur-Saone , near Sanofi Pasteur 's headquarters in Lyon , southeast of Paris . 
Sanofi Pasteur Chief Executive Wayne Pisano told Reuters in an interview last month that the company should be able to grow its sales by 8 to 12 percent a year in the medium term . 
Sales last year grew nearly 10 percent to 2.9 billion euros . 
-LRB- ID : nL7284492 -RRB- Sanofi has 12 manufacturing sites under construction or undergoing major renovation and they will come on line in 2009 . 
Among them is the recently approved U.S. factory in Pennsylvania , which is to produce the seasonal flu vaccine Fluzone . 
Viehbacher said the new flu site in the U.S. provided Sanofi the flexibility to also produce a vaccine against the new H1N1 flu strain if needed . 
So far the H1N1 virus has not shown signs of sustained person-to-person spread outside of North America and so has not yet tipped over into a pandemic , a top WHO official said on Monday .

2009-05-12,"CHICAGO | Tue May 12 , 2009 5:07 pm EDT CHICAGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Quest Diagnostics Inc has developed the first commercially available test to identify U.S. patients infected with the new H1N1 flu virus , the medical testing provider said on Tuesday . 
Quest said its Focus Diagnostics infectious disease reference laboratory validated the test using specimens confirmed as positive for the new virus by public health authorities . 
The test does not need to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , the company said . 
The virus , commonly referred to as swine flu , is a subtype of Influenza virus Type A. The Focus Diagnostics test detects the presence of Influenza A virus RNA and specifically identifies the presence of the novel H1N1 virus , Quest said . 
The test can detect the presenHHce of a virus ' RNA from a patient 's nasal or nasopharyngeal specimen . 
Quest said Focus Diagnostics will perform the new test at its reference laboratory in Cypress , California . 
`` The public health laboratories do n't have the capacity to do all the testing that is being requested . 
Now , clinicians and hospitals have another way to potentially identify this novel virus from patients by sending tests to us , '' said Dr. Jay Lieberman , medical director of Focus Diagnostics . 
`` We are very confident that the test will accurately identify this novel H1N1 strain , '' Lieberman told Reuters . 
The tests , which list for $ 300 , can be ordered directly from Focus Diagnostics or through the Quest Diagnostics national laboratory network , Quest said . 
The Focus Diagnosics laboratory is expected to report back on the test results within 24 hours of receiving a specimen . 
Quest said it also would submit positive specimens and test results to the appropriate public health authorities , as required by local public health guidelines .

Full Article ANALYSIS - Egypt 's pig cull fans sectarian tension Egyptian workers struggle to move a household pig into a truck to send it to the main slaughterhouse in the Manshiyat Nasser area in Cairo , May 4 , 2009 . 
CAIRO | Tue May 12 , 2009 3:16 pm IST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Egypt 's decision to ignore U.N. advice and cull its pigs over flu fears has unintentionally fanned sectarian tensions in the mainly Muslim country . 
Pigs in Egypt are primarily reared by Christian garbage collectors who let their animals scavenge on organic household waste in fly-infested slums . 
They sell the meat , which Muslims consider unclean , largely to other Christians . 
`` The Christians are Egypt 's garbage men , and we are not liked , '' said Marzouk Badr Adli after taking part in a recent protest against the cull in Cairo 's Manshiet Nasser shantytown . 
`` We serve the people and they come and cut off our livelihood . '' 
Egypt , already hit hard by bird flu , ordered the slaughter of all its 300,000 to 400,000 pigs on April 29 as a precaution against the new H1N1 flu virus , commonly known as swine flu , in a move the United Nations said was `` a real mistake '' . 
Egypt fears another flu virus could spread quickly in a country where most of the roughly 77 million people live in the densely packed Nile Valley , many in crowded Cairo slums . 
But the swiftness of Egypt 's decision -- taken without a broad public debate -- has left some Christians feeling bitter , especially as the virus has not yet been detected in the most populous Arab country and has not spread from pigs to people . 
Such bitterness adds to a list of popular frustrations facing the government in Egypt , where a fifth of the people live in grinding poverty , workers grumble about inflation and a global crisis has reined in economic growth . 
Christians account for about 10 percent of Egypt 's population , spanning all social classes . 
Relations with Muslims are usually harmonious although disputes over land , religious buildings or women occasionally erupt into violence . 
It has not helped that truckloads of security forces now stand guard at the entrance to garbage collector slums to help workers enforce the cull order , or that compensation has been low at just 100 Egyptian pounds -LRB- $ 17.79 -RRB- per adult pig . 
`` We are starting to get concerned at the strong sectarian tone that is beginning to dominate the public discourse , '' said Hossam Bahgat of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights . 
`` A discourse that implicates Christians with impurity on the one hand and disease on the other could have alarming consequences , '' he added . 
A government minister has described Egypt 's pigs as a time bomb , an Islamist parliamentarian appeared at a session in a protective mask , and the Coptic pope has stepped in to assure Muslims that most of his people do n't eat pork . 
The meat is mainly consumed , he says , by foreign tourists and expatriates . 
`` This is not happening in a vacuum . 
It is happening in a context of a polarised society and a high degree of sectarian tension , '' Bahgat said of the cull and response . 
But the decision to cull , while it does disproportionately affect Christians , was not taken for sectarian motives , most analysts agree . 
Rather , it was a chance for Egypt to rid urban areas of pigs -- something the government has long wanted . 
Pigs mingle in Cairo with birds , people and livestock in garbage collector slums , slurping up slop from trash brought in from across the city . 
Egypt has said swine in these areas pose a general health risk because of the unsanitary conditions . 
Furthermore , some officials have long expressed concerns that garbage collector areas could create an environment conducive for the more deadly H5N1 bird flu virus , now endemic in Egyptian poultry , to mutate or jump species . 
`` I do n't think that everything originated just to deal a blow to the Christians under the sectarian umbrella , '' said Youssef Sidhom , editor of a secular Coptic weekly , adding that the government was perhaps overly willing to respond to an H1N1 flu panic in parliament , fed at least partly by Islamists . 
`` It was irrational and it was foolish and it was rushed , '' he said of the decision . 
`` I ca n't understand the rush ... So , yes , the government has acted in an insensitive manner . '' 
Egypt , citing concerns over bird flu , had earlier sought to relocate pigs to a desert satellite city , but had not found the political will to do so before the swine flu crisis hit , even as it saw a surge in bird flu cases this year . 
Egypt 's main state newspaper initially said the state could pay 1,000 pounds per pig as compensation . 
But the government ultimately decided to hand the carcasses back to owners for consumption along with the much smaller amount of cash . 
Christian garbage collectors have since clashed with police in at least one garbage collector area . 
Meanwhile , some Muslims have expressed fear that an influx of pork from culled pigs could end up in their ground lamb or beef . 
Analysts note , however , that the tensions were not purely sectarian in nature . 
The cull had also ignited class resentments as it dealt a huge economic blow to an already marginalised community , with little apparent sympathy from the state . 
`` Everything becomes politicised into sectarian stuff in Egypt , '' said Laila Iskandar , a consultant who has worked with the garbage collectors . 
`` This is just one more of those things . ''

2009-05-12,"Most H1N1 patients do not need drugs to recover : WHO GENEVA | Tue May 12 , 2009 1:47 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Most H1N1 flu patients do not require antiviral therapy to recover , but it remains important to develop a pandemic vaccine as there is a risk of future drug resistance , a World Health Organization expert said on Tuesday . 
Nikki Shindo , a medical officer with the WHO 's global flu program , said the U.N. agency would soon publish new guidance about how to treat patients with the virus that has caused mainly mild symptoms outside of Mexico . 
Given most patients can recover with rest and hydration , Shindo said there did not appear to be a need to treat all people infected with the strain with Tamiflu , Relenza , and similar antiviral drugs . 
Saving such stockpiles for pregnant women and patients with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes may prove most prudent , she told a news conference . 
`` We will recommend to consider the use of antivirals for high risk groups , '' Shindo said , while allowing that because little is known about the new strain , it was possible antiviral drug use could be reducing its impact in Europe and elsewhere . 
`` It could be the reason why we are seeing less severe cases in Europe , '' she said in response to a journalist 's question . 
But comparisons between regions were difficult due to a lack of control studies . 
Shindo told reporters that about 10 percent of people known to have been infected with the strain known popularly as `` swine flu '' in Mexico and the United States required to be admitted to hospital -- far more than seen in regular seasonal flu . 
`` That I think has rightly urged the development and delivery of pandemic influenza vaccine , '' she told a news conference . 
`` We are also facing the risk of having resistant viruses , '' she said , noting that antiviral drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza have varying effectiveness against flu viruses as they mutate . 
`` Given that we will have winter in southern American countries and also other parts of the southern hemisphere , there will be a risk of having viruses that will be highly resistant to antivirals , '' Shindo said .

2009-05-12,"GENEVA | Tue May 12 , 2009 11:35 am EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new H1N1 flu virus could still mutate into a more virulent form and spark an influenza pandemic that could be expected to circle the globe up to three times , the World Health Organization said on Tuesday . 
The impact of any pandemic would vary , as a virus that causes only mild illness in countries with strong health systems can become `` devastating '' in those with weak health systems , shortages of drugs and poorly equipped hospitals , it said . 
The new virus , commonly referred to as swine flu , `` appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza '' and nearly the world 's whole population lacks immunity to the new disease , the WHO said in a document issued overnight entitled `` Assessing the severity of an influenza pandemic . '' 
`` It attempts to explain different aspects of severity , not just the pathogenicity of the virus but its impact on health and social systems , '' WHO spokesman Thomas Abraham told Reuters . 
`` It is in response to questions from the public and media . '' 
The United Nations agency 's pandemic alert level is at 5 , its second-highest level on a scale of 1 to 6 , he said . 
This means that the virus shows no signs of sustained person-to-person spread outside North America . 
Some 5,251 people have been infected in 30 countries , according to WHO 's tally on Tuesday , which includes 61 deaths . 
Hardest hit are Mexico with 2,059 cases , including 56 deaths , and the United States with 2,600 cases including three deaths . 
So far , with the exception of the deadly outbreaks in Mexico , the virus has tended to cause very mild illness in otherwise healthy people , it said . 
But influenza viruses mutate frequently and unpredictably and `` the emergence of an inherently more virulent virus during the course of a pandemic can never be ruled out , '' the WHO said . 
CIRCLING THE GLOBE IN WAVES `` The overall severity of a pandemic is further influenced by the tendency of pandemics to encircle the globe in at least two , sometimes three , waves , '' the WHO said . 
`` For many reasons , the severity of subsequent waves can differ dramatically in some or even most countries , '' it said . 
The 1918 influenza pandemic -- which killed tens of millions of people -- began mild and returned within six months in a much more lethal form , it said . 
The 1968 pandemic began relatively mild , with sporadic cases prior to the first wave , and remained mild in its second wave in most , but not all countries , it said . 
The new virus appears to be more easily spread than seasonal flu . 
Regular seasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people annually with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent . 
Seasonal flu has a so-called `` secondary attack rate '' -- the percentage of contacts who catch it from an infected person -- of between 5 and 15 percent , according to the WHO . 
`` Current estimates of the secondary attack rate of H1N1 range from 22 to 33 percent , '' it said . 
Outside Mexico , nearly all cases of illness and all deaths have been in people with underlying chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease , asthma and diabetes , according to WHO which has consulted widely with experts in affected countries . 
In Mexico and the United States -- the two largest and best documented outbreaks to date -- a younger age group has been affected than during seasonal epidemics of influenza , it said . 
`` Though cases have been confirmed in all age groups , from infants to the elderly , the youth of patients with severe or lethal infections is a striking feature of these early outbreaks , '' it said . 
WHO acting assistant director-general Keiji Fukuda said on Monday it was not possible to produce a scientific assessment of the severity of the outbreak , on the lines of a hurricane warning , because of the unpredictable nature of the disease and the fact that different people and different countries experience the flu in different ways .

2009-05-12,"HONG KONG | Tue May 12 , 2009 8:56 am EDT HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A leading virologist has described the new H1N1 influenza virus as `` very unstable , '' meaning it could mix and swap genetic material when exposed to other viruses . 
The new virus , which has infected 5,251 people in 30 countries and killed 61 , has displayed great efficiency in spreading among people , said Guan Yi , a microbiologist with the University of Hong Kong . 
`` This virus has been around only a few months , it is very unstable ... and we know that its presence is dramatically increasing in human population , so the chance of it meeting with H5N1 is actually increased , '' Guan said in an interview on Tuesday . 
`` Both H1N1 and H5N1 are unstable so the chances of them exchanging genetic material are higher , whereas a stable -LRB- seasonal flu -RRB- virus is less likely to take on genetic material . '' 
While H1N1 appears to be mild so far with many infected people recovering even without treatment , the H5N1 has a mortality rate of between 60 to 70 percent . 
Experts are fearful about the emergence of a hybrid which combines the killing power of the H5N1 with the efficient transmissibility of H1N1 . 
H5N1 is believed to be endemic in countries like China , Indonesia , Vietnam and Egypt . 
Guan , an expert on both the H5N1 and SARS , has analyzed the genetic sequences of the new virus , which is a triple reassortant containing genetic material from swine , human and bird . 
He said there was a huge information gap due to a lack of regular surveillance on animal disease . 
Each one of the eight gene segments in the new virus has been seen in pigs in the past 10 years , but experts have no clue when this new H1N1 virus strain first appeared and in which animal species it had been incubating , Guan said . 
`` We know when each gene segment appeared , but we do n't know when this strain first appeared , there is an information gap of about five to 10 years , from 1999 to 2009 . 
If there was regular surveillance , we would know when this virus came about , '' he said . 
`` We do n't know if this reassortment happened in pigs or human ... It 's likely to have come from pigs because all the segments have been found in pigs , but we ca n't be 100 percent sure . '' 
Guan backed stringent moves taken by some governments to keep the virus at bay , such as quarantining . 
`` They are useful because we are now fighting for time to develop vaccines and antivirals , which will then minimize its impact on people -LRB- over the longer term -RRB- , '' he said . 
`` Already it appears to more virulent than seasonal flu because it is killing younger people and it appears to have higher mortality than seasonal flu , so it does n't make sense to treat this like seasonal flu . '' 
Seasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people annually with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent . 
A study published in Science on Monday estimated that the new H1N1 flu virus has a case fatality ratio of 0.4 percent based on confirmed and suspected deaths .

2009-05-14,"No worse than a bad cold , say many of the Britons diagnosed with swine fever . 
So is it time for pig flu parties , to spread a mild version to build immunity ? 
As this is a new strain of H1N1 , we have no herd immunity Dotted up and down the UK , Tamiflu has been dispensed to swine flu sufferers and those who may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus . 
Some fret about taking the powerful antiviral drug - with its unpleasant side effects - and wonder if it might be wiser to catch swine flu now , priming our bodies to fight back if a more vicious form surfaces in winter . 
`` It would be quite a dangerous thing to do , '' says John Oxford , professor of virology at St Barts and the Royal London Hospitals , Queen Mary College . 
`` The scenario is that you get your mates together to spread swine flu . 
But then you take it home . 
Perhaps you take your dear old granny a cup of tea . 
You might recover fast , but those you expose might not It 's highly contagious , with the potential to infect many people Anyone can develop serious complications For this new version of H1N1 is highly contagious . 
Someone in rude health might recover quickly , albeit after enduring a fever , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
But they might pass it on to someone less able to fight it off - someone with diabetes , asthma or a weak immune system . 
`` A swine flu party would only work if you all then put yourselves in quarantine , or returned to your hermit hole , and did not touch anyone for at least 10 days . '' 
And while chickenpox or rubella parties were once popular as these illnesses are more straight-forward in childhood , swine flu is in a different league , warns Professor Oxford . 
Chickenpox can be fatal - but that is rare Although chickenpox can be fatal - that is rare . 
Dangerous complications can happen in a small number of healthy children or those with other chronic health problems . 
People have died from swine flu and less is known about the current strain . 
Health authorities do n't yet know enough about it to predict how it will affect individuals , how it will mutate and whether it will come back . 
The effects have so far been less dramatic than initially feared - Mexico has scaled back its death toll from 159 to 56 , and precautions such as school closures seem to have slowed its spread . 
But it has `` full pandemic potential '' , the World Health Organization says . 
A pandemic occurs when a new flu virus appears against which we have no immunity , resulting in outbreaks worldwide . 
Already cases have been confirmed in 30 countries , from Mexico to New Zealand , Canada to Thailand , Germany to the UK . 
`` What 's reassuring is that the UK has stockpiles of antiviral drugs , enough to treat those who contract swine flu or who are exposed to it , and to protect frontline medical staff , '' says Professor Oxford . 
`` My daughter 's a GP . 
If -LRB- swine flu -RRB- takes off and people come in to see her , she can take it prophylatically , one tablet a day for six weeks . '' 
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ? 
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines And although swine flu is a new virus , our bodies encounter other strains of H1N1 in the seasonal flu that does the rounds each year . 
`` We 're not as vulnerable as we were in 1957 's pandemic , which was a totally new virus . 
We 've come into contact with distant relatives of swine flu before . 
If you catch it , your body will say ' I know this family , I 've fought off its cousin , six times removed ' and go to work to fight it off . '' 
Prior exposure , through seasonal flu or swine flu vaccination when one becomes available , prompts the immune system to produce suitable antibodies to fight off the invader . 
`` And once exposed , you have lifetime memory of those antibodies and can produce them again , '' says Professor Oxford .

MANILA | Thu May 14 , 2009 10:59 am BST MANILA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Global trade in counterfeit goods , including medicines , CDs and DVDs , is expected to rise to nearly $ 1 trillion this year as economies worldwide continue to slump , security experts said on Thursday . 
An estimated $ 800 billion in fake cigarettes , branded shoes , bags and belts , and pirated movies flowed across the globe in 2007 , Stephen Sayell , vice president of Hong Kong-based Asia Risk group , told Reuters . 
That figure is expected to rise 20 percent this year . 
`` As the global financial crisis deepens , the demand for much cheaper consumer goods rises , boosting sales of counterfeiters and movie pirates , '' Sayell said on the sidelines of a three-day anti-terrorism seminar in Manila . 
Sayell said trade in counterfeit products has exceeded the global narcotics trade , worth more than $ 400 billion a year , citing studies made by his security consultancy group . 
Proceeds from the sale of counterfeit cigarettes , CDs and DVDs and branded consumer goods could be funding terrorist groups around the world because the activities are considered high profit and low-risk , he added . 
A former Scotland Yard officer , Sayell cited his experience in dealing with the Irish Republican Army 's counterfeiting operations to raise funds for their campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland . 
`` The IRA shifted from extorting money from the people to distributing pirated movies because they do n't find anything wrong stealing from Steven Spielberg , '' he added . 
John Enoch , another Asia Risk executive based in Singapore , warned of the potential spread of fake anti-viral drugs in the face of the global scare of a new deadly strain of flu virus that has killed over 50 people and infected more than 5,000 worldwide . 
`` We expect a boom in counterfeit medicines and vaccines against flu , '' Enoch said , warning of potential high risk of a public health threat because of the improper use of anti-viral drugs . 
In the Philippines , the health department has already issued a warning against offers by some medical facilities to provide anti-flu shots against the deadly strain of A-H1N1 virus that originated from Mexico . 
Last month , the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- warned against the proliferation of fake anti-malaria medicines in the Mekong area , blaming the counterfeit drugs for the emergence of a new strain of malaria that could spread in the region .

2009-05-14,"Now that the panic over the H1N1 flu strain has somewhat subsided , experts are contemplating what role Twitter played in helping the virus , commonly known as swine flu , go viral . 
The H1N1 virus has caused around 6,500 infections in 33 countries and 65 people have died so far , according to the World Health Organization . 
Common seasonal flu kills up to 500,000 people a year worldwide . 
So did Twitter put the media before the message and escalate anxieties by propagating rumors of biological attack and pork production infection ? 
Or did the Twittersphere prove itself to be the first choice in information for the wired era ? 
Tell us what you think . 
- Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist . 
The views expressed are his own -- If you look no further than the latest headlines , you might think a worldwide flu pandemic was already underway with a very real threat to millions of lives . 
While there are many unanswered questions early on in the outbreak of flu from Mexico , it is crucial to remember that the number of deaths and reported infections remain small -- even if its spread across the globe has proved worryingly rapid . 
While the infected need access to medical care and anti-viral drugs , the rest of the world needs an inoculation against scary statistics and misinformation . 
-- James Saft is a Reuters columnist . 
The opinions expressed are his own -- Besides being a human tragedy , a deadly pandemic is , quite literally , the last thing a global economy suffering a huge drop off in trade and activity needs . 
To be very clear , we 've no idea how severe or widespread the evolving outbreak of a new form of swine flu will be and indications that it seems to be becoming milder as it travels from Mexico are reassuring . 
Dean Wright is Global Editor , Ethics , Innovation and News Standards . 
Any opinions are his own . 
There s nothing like a disease outbreak to highlight the value of the media in alerting and informing the public in the face of an emergency . 
There s also nothing like it to bring out some of our more excessive behavior , essentially shouting Run for your lives !

2009-05-14,"Filipino science research specialists wearing protective suits work on a testing kit from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control -LRB- CDC -RRB- on how to determine the presence of the new H1N1 flu virus , formerly referred to as the swine flu , inside the laboratory of the Philippine Research Institute for Tropical Medicine at Muntinlupa city , south of Manila , May 14 , 2009 . 
GENEVA | Thu May 14 , 2009 5:43 pm BST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The H1N1 flu strain has not yet taken hold outside the Americas region , but the outbreak is serious and requires close monitoring , a World Health Organisation official said on Thursday . 
Keiji Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director-general , said the United Nations agency was maintaining its pandemic alert at the second-highest notch of 5 despite the virus having caused 6,497 infections in 33 countries . 
`` If we see changes in the severity we will let the world know about that , '' he told a news conference . 
`` This is an event that is serious and that requires close monitoring . '' 
The Phase 5 designation means a pandemic is imminent . 
Leading vaccine makers including GlaxoSmithKline , Sanofi-Aventis , Novartis and Baxter International are awaiting guidance from the WHO about whether to start manufacturing vaccines for a pandemic instead of seasonal flu . 
Vaccine experts convened by the WHO on Thursday did not reach a firm conclusion about whether such a switch should take place , or whether the H1N1 strain should be included in the mixture of the seasonal flu jab , Fukuda said . 
`` There will be additional meetings , '' he said after that teleconference drawing together pharmaceutical representatives and health officials , which he said ended with `` no big decisions , no pronouncements . '' 
Because seasonal flu kills up to 500,000 people a year , health officials have been calling for the continued production of vaccines for at-risk people including the elderly , pregnant women , and people with other health conditions like asthma . 
A WHO medical officer told reporters earlier this week that such groups should also have priority in the distribution of antiviral drugs that have been shown to work against the H1N1 strain , which is a mixture of swine , bird and human viruses . 
But Fukuda stressed on Thursday that the WHO did not plan to alter its guidance on when and whether to prescribe antivirals like Roche 's Tamiflu or GlaxoSmithKline 's Relenza , saying this was at countries ' discretion . 
`` WHO is not making any changes in its recommendations on antivirals , '' he told the news conference . 
The United Nations agency has convened an intergovernmental meeting about the sharing of flu virus samples -- which vaccine makers need to formulate the ingredients of jabs -- at its Geneva headquarters on Friday . 
The flu and global needs for antiviral drugs and pandemic vaccines are also expected to dominate next week 's World Health Assembly , an annual meeting that will draw top health officials from around the world to Geneva . 
According to the latest WHO tally , 65 people have died from infection with the H1N1 virus , which remains most prevalent in North America . 
Evidence that the flu is spreading in a sustained way in Europe , Asia or elsewhere would cause the WHO to raise the pandemic alert to the top level of 6 . 
The WHO said Mexico has had 2,446 confirmed cases including 60 deaths . 
The United States has reported 3,352 confirmed cases including 3 deaths . 
Canada has 389 confirmed cases and Costa Rica 8 cases , both with one death . 
Other countries with confirmed cases but no deaths are Argentina -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Australia -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Austria -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Brazil -LRB- 8 -RRB- , Britain -LRB- 71 -RRB- , China -LRB- 4 -RRB- , Colombia -LRB- 7 -RRB- , Cuba -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Denmark -LRB- 1 -RRB- , El Salvador -LRB- 4 -RRB- , Finland -LRB- 2 -RRB- , France -LRB- 14 -RRB- , Germany -LRB- 12 -RRB- , Guatemala -LRB- 3 -RRB- , Ireland -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Israel -LRB- 7 -RRB- , Italy -LRB- 9 -RRB- , Japan -LRB- 4 -RRB- , Netherlands -LRB- 3 -RRB- New Zealand -LRB- 7 -RRB- , Norway -LRB- 2 -RRB- , Panama -LRB- 29 -RRB- , Poland -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Portugal -LRB- 1 -RRB- , South Korea -LRB- 3 -RRB- , Spain -LRB- 100 -RRB- , Sweden -LRB- 2 -RRB- , Switzerland -LRB- 1 -RRB- and Thailand -LRB- 2 -RRB- .

Social networks also continued their tear last month , growing 12 percent to nearly 140 million visitors . 
That 's about three-quarters of the U.S. online population , comScore says , so chances are someone you know is either is Twittering , Facebook-ing or on MySpace . 
Twitter jumped 83 percent to 17 million visitors , while Facebook grew 10 percent in April from the previous month to reach 67.5 million visitors . 
MySpace had 71 million visitors .

But look at the facts . 
The genetic make-up of the virus may have been predominantly porcine but the pigs themselves did n't have it . 
Even at the supposed epicentre of the outbreak in Mexico they showed no symptoms -- things reached such a state that owners of some pig farms in the US were stopping humans coming near them in case they infected their animals . 
The pigs were innocent OK ? 
And yet the name `` swine flu '' stuck , lots of people stopped eating pork and in Egypt they were even culled . 
Use Twitter 's name even when you 're dissing it : that could be a good way to ensure some publicity , given the hype around everyone 's current sweetheart . 
But maybe Scribd , the social publishing startup that lets you upload all kinds of documents online and embed them into blog posts , does have a point about the misinformation that Twitterers could be putting up in 140-character bursts . 
After all , at the Society of American Business Editors and Writers -LRB- SABEW -RRB- conference last week , CUNY J-school professor Sandeep Junnarkar did begin his workshop on Twitter for journalists with a caveat : `` Everything you find on Twitter is rumors , false information . 
That 's the default position . '' 
Kind of like what journalists and students are always told about Wikipedia . 
A press release that landed in my inbox from Scribd seeks to distinguish the San Francisco-based startup as `` anti-Twitter '' -- the antithesis of Twitter . 
Scribd is `` quickly becoming a trusted source for unfiltered , detailed information about the swine flu , '' the release says . 
Facebook has been mapping swine flu discussions among its members for the past few days using its Lexicon application , and it 's pretty cool to see how the conversation on Wall posts shot up over the weekend as more and more cases of the disease came to light in the United States . 
Lexicon , for those who do n't have to follow Facebook 's every move , is a tool the social networking site uses to follow trends on words and phrases that are being used on `` Walls , '' the open space on each member 's profile where friends can post comments .

2009-05-15,"ATLANTA | Fri May 15 , 2009 2:58 pm EDT ATLANTA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama on Friday named a new director for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , tapping a health activist who pushed for expanding AIDS testing and banning smoking in restaurants . 
Dr. Thomas Frieden , 48 , who has been New York City 's top health official since 2002 , will head the federal agency charged with protecting Americans from illnesses ranging from heart disease to new flu strains . 
Under Frieden 's leadership , New York became the first city in the country to ban trans fats , which clog arteries and raise the risk of heart disease , from food in restaurants . 
He will take over as director of an organization that has been central to global efforts to combat the H1N1 flu virus . 
The illness , also known as swine flu , has killed 65 people , most in Mexico and infected nearly 6,500 people in 33 nations . 
`` Frieden is an expert in preparedness and response to health emergencies , and has been at the forefront of the fight against heart disease , cancer and obesity , infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and AIDS , '' the White House said in a statement . 
`` Frieden has been a leader in the fight for health care reform , and his experiences confronting public health challenges in our country and abroad will be essential in this new role , '' it said . 
In New York he spearheaded the country 's biggest community-based electronic health record project in an effort to improve preventive care . 
Frieden also worked in India for five years on tuberculosis control and has experience as an epidemiologist , administrator , teacher , researcher , clinician and community organizer . 
Frieden , who will start his job in June , told a news conference he was `` deeply honored '' by the appointment . 
The new CDC director brings `` real world experience fighting AIDS '' to the agency , according to The AIDS Healthcare Foundation , the largest HIV\/AIDS organization in the country . 
Frieden has pressed for expanding routine testing for AIDS as a first step to controlling a virus that is spreading in the United States among minorities , gay and bisexual men and many women . 
Jeff Levi of the Trust for America 's Health , an advocacy and study group often critical of U.S. health policy , described Frieden as a bold leader who could reinvigorate the CDC . 
But he argued that the agency 's director is often a passive diplomat with fewer powers of direct persuasion than a state or city health officer and that the organization must wait to be invited by state authorities or governments to intervene . 
In evidence of divided reaction to some of Frieden 's decisions in New York , the Center for Consumer Freedom , a coalition supported by restaurants , food companies and consumers , called Frieden an `` over-zealous activist '' . 
Frieden `` does n't give any consideration to personal responsibility or privacy '' when it comes to health , said Justin Wilson , a research analyst for the center . 
Frieden will likely follow the lead of former CDC director Dr. Julie Gerberding in becoming a visible spokesperson for the agency . 
The CDC has been headed by acting director Dr. Richard Besser since Gerberding resigned in January . 
Besser became the public face of the organization 's fight against H1N1 during daily televised news briefings . 
He will continue in his role coordinating CDC 's office of terrorism preparedness and emergency response , the statement said . 
The CDC , based in Atlanta , has a budget of around $ 9 billion and is responsible for tracking diseases across the United States and helping other countries battle outbreaks of diseases ranging from H5N1 avian influenza to Ebola .

2009-05-15,"The new flu strain that emerged in Mexico last month has brought Japanese TV shows , newspapers and government ads out in a rash of demonstration s of the art of proper hand-washing to avoid the spread of germs . 
`` First , you clean the palms , then rub the dirt off the back of the hands . 
Make sure you wash between fingers and finger tips . 
And yes , do n't forget your thumbs and wrists !! '' Even for the Japanese , who wear flu and hay fever masks by the million , sometimes when they 're not even sick , washing hands thoroughly for at least 15 seconds requires extra effort , as not many of us are well-versed in proper thumb-washing techniques . 
The government also has a `` cough etiquette '' campaign calling on people to cover their mouths with a tissue when in the act , adding the rather obvious need to face away from other people . 
The guideline says post-cough dirty tissues must be thrown away immediately , although it does n't say where - a slight drawback in a country that is occasionaly trashcan-challenged . 
Japan reported its first confirmed cases of the new flu recently and now has four patients , detected at Narita international Airport and sent directly to a hospital nearby to limit the spread of H1N1 . 
The government continues to have health officials board planes from Mexico , the United States and Canada to check passengers , including using portable thermal sensors to find people with fever . 
A Reuters colleague went through on-board medical checks lasting more than one hour last week . 
`` In the U.S. , everything was more relaxed , '' she told me the other day . 
`` Some people were getting irritated by the wait on the plane but no one was angry . 
As we had to wait for all passengers to be inspected , a flight attendant announced results of the NBA playoffs to take our minds off our frustration . '' 
Handed a mask to wear when leaving the plane , she got a call a few days later from a local public health center that took down her contact numbers , travel history and health conditions after the flight . 
Despite these efforts , it seems like it 's just a matter of time before the disease spreads around the country , whether or not we wash our hands and cough correctly .

2009-05-16,"GENEVA | Sat May 16 , 2009 6:41 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Health negotiators from rich and poor countries failed on Saturday to clinch a full deal on virus sharing to produce vaccines , but expressed satisfaction that they had closed gaps on some tough political issues . 
The H1N1 influenza outbreak which has spread around the world from Mexico and the United States , leading the World Health Organisation to declare a flu pandemic is imminent , has given added urgency to the work of the intergovernmental meeting , set up two years ago by the WHO . 
The meeting agreed late on Saturday after a good-humored two-day session to forward a framework agreement on sharing influenza viruses and on access to vaccine benefits -- including its gaps to next week 's World Health Assembly -LRB- WHA -RRB- at the WHO . 
The assembly can then decide how to work further on the agreement , either during its meeting -- truncated because of the swine flu outbreak -- or later . 
Jane Halton , the top official in Australia 's Health and Aging Department , who chaired the meeting , told delegates they had achieved a significant amount of work . 
`` Yes , we acknowledge here that there are matters we have not resolved , and yes , they are difficult , but I do think a good body of material has been produced , '' she said . 
The meeting was set up in 2007 amid a scare about H5N1 influenza , or bird flu , which is often fatal to humans , as part of the WHO 's efforts to prepare for a pandemic . 
The WHO wanted to ensure that virus samples would be circulated to laboratories and drug firms around the world so that they could produce a vaccine against the disease . 
Poor countries argued they should have access to the resulting vaccines , especially if the samples came from the developing world . 
But rich countries led by the United States wanted pharmaceuticals companies to be able to claim the vaccines as intellectual property and earn royalties on them . 
In 2006 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control -LRB- CDC -RRB- lodged a patent application for a new flu vaccine , and filed it with the World Intellectual Property Organisation in 2007 . 
The new vaccine incorporated genes from an H5N1 strain isolated from an Indonesian victim of bird flu in 2005 . 
But in 2007 Indonesia refused to share H5N1 virus samples without guarantees that any vaccines derived from them would be made available to poorer countries at an affordable price . 
The main sticking point remains the wording of a standard agreement on transferring material , and some intellectual property questions . 
Developing countries wanted a comprehensive material transfer agreement , while rich countries were against any agreement but eventually settled for a simple one . 
Abdulsalami Nasidi , a senior Nigerian health ministry official , told reporters the meeting had cleared up many unresolved issues . 
Delegates virtually agreed to free biological material moving through the WHO network from intellectual property rules , he said . 
WHO Director-General Margaret Chan has already implemented some things agreed in the meeting 's two years , on traceability of material and benefit-sharing , Halton told reporters . 
`` The reality is the system can and will happen and in fact the work that 's been done in a number of these areas has been adopted , '' she said . 
GlaxoSmithKline , Sanofi-Aventis , Novartis , Baxter International and other drug makers are awaiting WHO guidance about whether to start mass-producing vaccines to fight H1N1 , which may force them to cut production of seasonal flu shots .

The man , traveling with his family from the United States via Amsterdam , was diagnosed after arriving at Istanbul 's Ataturk Airport en route to Iraq on Friday , Turkish Health Minister Recep Akdag said at a news conference . 
Six family members traveling with the man were also quarantined at a Turkish research hospital , where they were being given anti-viral medication , Akdag said . 
Tests showed the man 's mother was also infected with the H1N1 virus , Harun Celik , the Health Ministry 's spokesman , told Reuters . 
Local media had reported earlier the man 's wife was suffering from the disease , but Celik denied those reports . 
`` His mother also tested positive for swine flu . 
None of the other family members have any health issues , '' Celik said . 
The entire family will be held for observation until May 21 to determine whether they may have contracted swine flu , because the virus takes up to a week to manifest itself , Akdag said . 
India on Saturday also reported its first victim of the H1N1 virus . 
The spread of the disease has led the World Health Organisation to declare a pandemic is imminent . 
India and Turkey are the 37th and 38th countries to confirm cases of H1N1 virus . 
The WHO said on Saturday 72 people had died from the disease or its complications . 
The Iraqi-American family was traveling on a KLM aircraft to Istanbul that was carrying 163 passengers , most of whom are now being monitored for signs of the flu , Akdag said . 
`` We know of the existence of a few -LRB- passengers -RRB- whom we 've been unable to contact , '' Akdag said . 
`` They need to be alert so that they can be given preventative medicine and in order to protect others . ''

2009-05-16,"A Turkish TV journalist wears a protective mask as he reports outside a clinic of the Haseki hospital , where Turkey 's first case of H1N1 swine flu is hospitalized , in Istanbul , May 16 , 2009 . 
GENEVA | Sat May 16 , 2009 5:17 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organization is closely monitoring the situation in Japan after three students from the same high school who had not traveled abroad came down with the new H1N1 flu , a senior WHO official said on Saturday . 
The city of Kobe is closing some schools for a week after eight people , including the three students , were confirmed as being infected with the disease , also known as swine flu , Kyodo news agency reported . 
`` We are just watching the developments very carefully , '' acting assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda told reporters . 
But Fukuda said it was not clear at this stage whether the outbreak in Japan would cause the WHO to declare a full pandemic , raising its alert level to the top of a 6-point scale . 
The WHO raised its pandemic alert on April 29 to 5 on the scale , meaning a pandemic is imminent . 
Proof the disease was spreading in a region outside North America , where it originated , would trigger an increase to 6 . 
`` If we go to phase 6 the events could happen anywhere , they could happen in Europe , they can happen in South America , they could happen in Asia , '' he said . 
Earlier the WHO reported the number of confirmed cases of H1N1 flu had climbed to 8,451 , including 72 deaths . 
The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of H1N1 , has risen to 36 with Ecuador and Peru confirming their first cases , the WHO said in its daily update . 
The vast majority of cases have been in Mexico and the United States . 
WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said on Friday there remained `` great uncertainty '' about the new strain , which continues to spread and could pose particular threats in Southeast Asia . 
U.S. health officials later on Friday announced they were easing their warning on travel to Mexico . 
The virus is behaving much like a seasonal influenza strain -- spreading rapidly and causing mainly mild disease , but severe illness in some people . 
Seasonal flu kills 500,000 people a year , mainly the elderly or those with respiratory problems like asthma . 
The WHO said Mexico has reported 2,895 confirmed cases including 66 deaths . 
The United States has reported 4,714 confirmed cases including four deaths . 
Canada has 496 confirmed cases and Costa Rica nine cases , both with one death . 
The WHO 's tally lags national reports but is considered more secure . 
Rising numbers can indicate that a backlog of cases is being processed , as well as the spread of the disease . 
Since Saturday 's WHO figures were collated , Turkey has confirmed its first two cases , and India confirmed its first case .

2009-05-18,"James Reynolds | 11:50 UK time , Monday , 18 May 2009 As I 've written here before , China is a country that reveres age . 
But there 's one question that I 've always forgotten to ask : when does old age actually begin in this country ? 
There are a few clues in the way people address one another . 
In China , when you 're young , you can be called `` Xiao '' - which means little . 
If you 're older , you can get the prefix `` Lao '' - which means old . 
So , at what age can you get promoted from Xiao to Lao ? 
Thirty five , says a friend of mine . 
However , whether you 're called Xiao or Lao also depends on whether or not the person you 're talking to is older or younger than you . 
Still , if you 've hit 35 and you 've managed to win yourself the prefix Lao , you do n't automatically qualify to be seen as old . 
For that , apparently , you may have to join a dance troupe . 
The Chinese dancers appear to be in their 40s or 50s - each of them apparently healthy and vigorous . 
However , the picture caption refers to them as `` local elderly . '' 
-LRB- I ca n't imagine they will take this as a compliment . -RRB- 
In China , respect for age seems to be mirrored by an equally powerful desire to delay the moment when you will be seen as old . 
The Communist Party 's most senior leaders - the nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee - do not appear to have a single gray hair between them . 
It 's a fairly astonishing achievement for a group of men well into their 50s and 60s . 
The only time you tend to see a government official with gray hair is if he has been arrested and put on trial - where he is deprived both of his freedom and , apparently , his hair dye . 
Where does this comment come from ? 
`` The only time you tend to see a government official with gray hair is if he has been arrested and put on trial - where he is deprived both of his freedom and , apparently , his hair dye . '' 
At 1:17 pm on 18 May 2009 , XunFang wrote : There isnt really a definite age definition for Lao or Xiao . 
Its purely a prefix used in front of a persons surname to address him\/her . 
If a person who is older than you address you , he will probably use Xiao , while a younger person who is addressing you will probably use Lao . 
The only time you tend to see a government official with gray hair is if he has been arrested and put on trial - where he is deprived both of his freedom and , apparently , his hair dye . 
Image has become more and more important not only for government officials , but also for ordinary Chinese people . 
Guess people are more image conscious nowadays . 
Who knows , hair transplant will be next on the list . 
Beauty is only skin deep after all . 
Hair dye will probably be the last thing on his\/her mind , when he\/she is arrested for corruption charges etc. . 
BTW , dont criminals have to shave their head or at least keep their hair very short while in jail ? 
Whats the point of hair dye ?? At 1:43 pm on 18 May 2009 , davidwhite44 wrote : Aha , Lao Reynolds , there you are ! 
I 'm always astonished by the sacrifice which elderly Chinese people make for their grandchildren . 
It 's almost assumed that once the grandchildren are born they will take on the role of carer whilst the parents are off earning the dosh . 
Even for Chinese living in the West , the grandparents will fly half way around the world to a strange land where they ca n't understand a word of the language to look after the little one . 
This is truly admirable .

No , these middle-aged Chinese did not take this as a compliment . 
In China , the retirement age is 55 for women and 60 for man . 
When people -LRB- in middle age -RRB- find out that they are approaching their retirement , they start to consider themselves old -- it does n't mean they are pleased by their age or take `` elderly people '' as a compliment . 
In many cases , they just make fun of themseleves .

Look at what they sell on television commercials and billboards ... youth .

In Chinese history poverty combined with a very hard life made a long life a rarity , so the achievement of old age was unusual and therefore revered . 
The First Emperor , Quin Shi Huang-Di , was reported to have died from taking `` the Elixir of Life . '' 
Over 2,500 years ago the Buddha taught that human beings should accept the evident impermance of all things and human beings have continued to reject the reality of aging and death . 
Fortunes have been made on creating the illusion of youth . 
We know that in the world of politics illusion is primary , look at the world financial crisis . 
The financial crisis was simply the creation of the illusion that profits could be made without placing collaterial at risk or not having any at all .

The Last Sentence is extremely exact . 
The most important reason that these Chinese emperors keep their pates black -LRB- even some of them have already bared -RRB- is to show that they are energetic and they can hold the power until they died . 
The dancers you thought to be in their 40s could be in their 50s or even 60s .

I 've asked a few people older than the People 's Republic , who recall the days before 1949 when there was no China Daily nor leaders with hair dye - people used to just address each other Miss , Mrs , Mister . 
But soon the Revolution changed absolutely everything and - calling others with prefixes Comrade and Lao or Xiao something for someone you know , became the only safe option ... Despite a slow revival of certain previously abandoned customs since the openning-up of China , the age-rank-conscious sexless communist way of prefixing `` Lao '' or `` Xiao '' to a family name remains .

I find the issue a bit ridiculous . 
Modern societies for the most part are obsessed with youth ; appearance , vigor , perception , etc. . 
In addition , some celebrities attempt to combine a perception of wisdom or intellect with their youthful persona as they position themselves as experts or spokespersons of critical issues . 
So , such is the paradox of modern man and woman to be young and wise as the masses clamor around those who appear to achieve it . 
Older societies who revered the elderly probably represented the other extreme , presumably equating years with wisdom , but today we have certainly jumped over to the opposite end . 
Moderation tends to be a mark humans often missed .

hehe , this is not always true . 
You are only old when you die ; then you do n't get any older . 
These are my sentiments . 
I am a so-called Senior Citizens , but I avoid the Senior Centre where everything is made pleasant for the old . 
I can only manage to be old for about two hours at a time , so I never fit in . 
I like everything current and change since I have lived through a mirriad of changes in my life . 
I first discovered I was getting old when I did not like RAP . 
This is the music of the current generation , and I wanted to be current , not to avoid being old , but to avoid not being current . 
One must look for the signs and signifiers of being old , not of aging because aging is a zero sum game : either you are in , or you are out of life , so aging is part of life . 
Now that I am senior , I can look back on life and criticise with accuracy because I have lived over half a century and seen every president from Eisenhower to Obama . 
But the Queen has always been the same . 
The Chinese have change , but I still prefer Mao . 
There is a difference between reverence for age and desire for young-looking appearance . 
The former emphasises ` experienced ' or ` senior ' in rank , i.e. the importance of interpersonal social relations , whereas the later suggests physical or bodily maintenance -- a growing trend widely observed across many parts of the world .

An interesting point , but I have always found the opposite to be true - unfortunately . 
I 've stopped guessing the age of Chinese now having over-estimated frequently .

Unfortunately , your last sentence reveals your identity . 
China already has a great number of TVs , Newspapers even plainclothes everywhere to praise the government or , more exactly , the party . 
So criticisms could be more `` precious '' than wasting his time in charming up to the party .

There is perhaps a political slant to his comment , but from a different point of view , Mr Reynolds is simply pointing out that the politicians of our great country , though revered for age and experience , are hesitant to reveal the extent of their aging to the general public . 
Nonetheless , a good post , Mr Reynolds . 
Outside my home every morning there are a group of kung-fu ballroom dancers of the 50 + age range variety , it 's a great way to keep looking young and staying fit .

2009-05-18,"GENEVA | Mon May 18 , 2009 6:14 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The H1N1 flu virus is likely to keep spreading rapidly between people , within countries and across the globe , the head of the World Health Organization said on Monday . 
U.S. health officials also expressed concern about who the new swine flu virus is infecting -- mostly children , teens and young adults -- and outbreaks in schools . 
Ministers and experts began a meeting in Geneva to discuss how to fight the virus with vaccines and drugs , as well as what would trigger the WHO to declare a full pandemic . 
`` For the first time in humanity , we are seeing , or we may be seeing , pandemic influenza evolving in front of our eyes , '' WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan told her U.N. agency 's World Health Assembly . 
New York City recorded its first death from the virus and Chile reported two new cases , adding to its first two cases reported on Sunday . 
Japan also confirmed that 125 people , many of whom had not been abroad , had been infected with the new strain . 
Tests confirmed the first case in Greece , a Greek man traveling from the United States , the Health Ministry said . 
Forty countries have confirmed cases of the new strain . 
Almost all of the 74 dead were in Mexico , but mostly , people have had relatively mild symptoms . 
Addressing the WHO 's annual congress , Tonga 's health minister said it was lucky the H1N1 strain had spread first to affluent countries such as the United States , Canada , and Japan . 
`` Somehow , somebody decided to start this epidemic in very rich countries ... This helped all of us , '' said Health Minister Viliami Tangi . 
Poor countries lack the medical staff , laboratories , drug stockpiles , and vaccine-making capacity to deal with the outbreak in a sophisticated manner , he said . 
Chan said H1N1 may pose a particular risk if it somehow mixed with the H5N1 avian flu virus , now entrenched in poultry in several countries . 
`` No one can say how this avian virus will behave when pressured by large numbers of people infected with the new H1N1 virus , '' she said . 
Egypt 's envoy noted there had been three new human cases of H5N1 in his country in the last week . 
Dr Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said most of the 200 or so Americans hospitalized with the new swine flu strain were younger -- as opposed to seasonal flu , which hits the elderly the hardest . 
`` That 's very unusual , to have so many people under 20 to require hospitalization , and some of them in -LRB- intensive care units -RRB- , '' Schuchat told reporters in a telephone briefing . 
`` We are now experiencing levels of influenza-like illness that are higher than usual for this time of year , '' Schuchat added . 
`` We are also seeing outbreaks in schools , which is extremely unusual for this time of year . '' 
New York City health officials said 16 schools were closed there due to outbreaks . 
Most of Japan 's new infections were among high school students in the western prefectures of Hyogo and Osaka who had not traveled abroad , the Health Ministry said . 
But Canada lifted travel warnings about Mexico . 
`` With the H1N1 virus circulating within Canada , travel to Mexico is no longer a heightened risk factor for the spread of the virus , '' Chief Public Health Officer Dr David Butler-Jones told a conference call with reporters . 
WHO raised its global pandemic alert level last month to 5 on a 6-point scale . 
WHO has said it is watching the situation in Japan closely , but it was not clear yet whether the outbreak , the largest outside the Americas , would trigger a move to level 6 . 
Under WHO rules , signs that the disease is spreading in a sustained way in a second region of the world would prompt a declaration that a full pandemic is under way . 
Other large clusters have been seen in Spain and Britain . 
A WHO designation of a full pandemic would put countries on even higher alert about the flu strain and give more impetus to pharmaceutical efforts to fight it . 
Chan and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will meet pharmaceutical executives on Tuesday to discuss their ability to make vaccines to fight the strain . 
Delegates will seek an agreement on how samples of the virus should be handled and shared with pharmaceutical companies . 
However , rich and poor countries remain at odds over whether the biological material can be patented . 
The meeting will also discuss poor countries ' needs for antiviral drugs like Roche and Gilead Sciences Inc 's Tamiflu and GlaxoSmithKline 's Relenza and any vaccines developed to confront the strain .

2009-05-18,"By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Mon May 18 , 2009 4:12 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new influenza strain circulating around most of the United States is putting a worrying number of young adults and children into the hospital and hitting more schools than usual , U.S. health officials said on Monday . 
The H1N1 swine flu virus killed a vice principal at a New York City school over the weekend and has spread to 48 states . 
While it appears to be mild , it is affecting a disproportionate number of children , teenagers and young adults . 
This includes people needing hospitalization -- now up to 200 , said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
`` That 's very unusual , to have so many people under 20 to require hospitalization , and some of them in -LRB- intensive care units -RRB- , '' Schuchat told reporters in a telephone briefing . 
`` We are now experiencing levels of influenza-like illness that are higher than usual for this time of year , '' Schuchat added . 
`` We are also seeing outbreaks in schools , which is extremely unusual for this time of year . '' 
New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Frieden agreed with Schuchat . 
`` We 're seeing increasing numbers of people going to emergency departments saying they have fever and flu , particularly young people in the 5 to 17 age group , '' Frieden , who has been named by U.S. President Barack Obama as the new CDC director , told a news conference . 
About half of all cases of influenza are being diagnosed as the new H1N1 strain , while the rest are influenza B , or the seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 strains . 
Flu season in the United States is usually almost over by May . 
CDC officials say around 100,000 people are likely infected with the new flu strain in the United States and Schuchat said the 5,123 confirmed and probable cases and six deaths in the United States were `` the tip of the iceberg . '' 
`` We are seeing more reports of influenza-like illness from outpatient visits that we monitor than is typical for this time of year , '' Schuchat said . 
Because doctors usually treat symptoms and only occasionally give flu tests to patients , the CDC must monitor reports of symptoms such as fever , cough and muscle aches to track flu activity . 
Some centers are doing actual influenza tests to confirm the patterns that are seen . 
Influenza is a factor in 36,000 deaths a year in the United States and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths globally , the CDC says . 
`` Unlike the seasonal flu , we are seeing relatively few cases or hospitalizations in people over 65 , '' Schuchat said . 
Usually flu kills the elderly and people with chronic diseases . 
There is no evidence that a second , bacterial infection is worsening the H1N1 cases , Schuchat said . 
When family members are questioned , it seems clear that children and teens are more prone to infection than older adults , Schuchat said . 
`` People under 18 are more likely to have infections when another person in the family is infected , '' she said . 
`` One of our working hypotheses is that older adults may have some pre-existing protection against this virus due to their exposure long ago to some virus that may be distantly related , '' Schuchat said . 
An alternative hypothesis is that it just has not had a chance to make its way into the older population yet .

2009-05-18,"NEW YORK | Mon May 18 , 2009 4:02 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A New York City school principal suffering from swine flu died on Sunday , becoming the city 's first death due to H1N1 flu , medical officials said . 
Mitchell Wiener , 55 , died after being admitted to Flushing Hospital Medical Center several days ago with the H1N1 flu virus , said Dr. Andrew Rubin , a hospital spokesman . 
A city Health Department spokeswoman also confirmed a death , but could not confirm the victim 's identity . 
It was the first death in New York City , where many of the U.S. cases have been reported but with mostly mild symptoms . 
Wiener had been in and out of consciousness and was being treated with an experimental drug , but family members had said as recently as Saturday that he was making some progress . 
Wiener was the assistant principal of Intermediate School 236 in Hollis in the New York borough of Queens . 
The school was one of several city schools to be shuttered after the illness afflicted patients and staff members . 
Three additional schools will be closed beginning Monday in Queens for up to five school days after officials documented increasing levels of influenza-like illnesses . 
`` Given the large number of cases , it is entirely possible that in the coming days there will be people with severe illness from flu , particularly among people who have underlying health problems , '' city Health Commissioner Thomas Frieden warned . 
The department said it would evaluate more school closings on the case-by-case basis .

2009-05-18,"-- Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist . 
The opinions expressed are his own -- Stock research analysts get no respect these days . 
An academic study has concluded that share recommendations have little impact . 
A 51-page study entitled `` On the information role of stock recommendations , '' finds that buy and sell ratings are uninformative and often try to `` piggyback '' on actual news for their influence . 
This begs the dismal question : if professional analysts ca n't get it right , what hope for the ordinary investor ?

Sell-side research -- driven by the need of the analyst 's employer to trade stocks -- dominates daily market conversations . 
Recommendations are the signposts of these debates , without which many investors would be lost .

This `` cash-and-carry '' strategy rewards market participants with access to storage or finance at the lowest cost . 
It is providing huge profits for physical commodity merchants , investment banks , and the owners and operators of warehouses and tank farms during the downturn , and helps explain the record profitability from commodity operations reported recently by some of the largest banking and trading groups .

2009-05-18,"Live rats are stored awaiting transport to Vietnam at Chrey Thom district in Kandal province , 65km -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- south of Phnom Penh near the Cambodia-Vietnam border , May 15 , 2009 . 
CHREY THOM , Cambodia | Mon May 18 , 2009 11:51 am EDT CHREY THOM , Cambodia -LRB- Reuters Life ! -RRB- 
- Stir-fried or grilled , Vietnamese ca n't seem to get enough of Cambodian rat meat , and the global influenza outbreak as well as recent heavy rains have proven a boon for both consumers and exporters . 
In Chrey Thom , a Cambodian town on the border with Vietnam , motorbike after motorbike carries wooden cages full of hundreds of the plump , furry , brown rats . 
The rains in the Mekong Delta area have helped boost the Cambodian trappers ' catch , as more rats rush out from their flooded holes and into waiting cages . 
`` There were so many rodents we just ca n't eat them all , so we need to export lots more to Vietnam , '' Cambodian rat trader Kang Chanthan told Reuters . 
`` It 's good business . '' 
`` If you prepare them well and fry the meat with garlic and put some mint on it , they 're tastier than chickens , '' he added . 
Worries about swine flu , as the H1N1 influenza virus was first called , may have also spurred demand . 
The spread of H1N1 flu was not caused by pigs and pork , but many people and governments have reacted to the name . 
`` Rat meat substitutes well for pork these days , '' said Khe Le , adding that her family exported up to a ton of live rats across the border on good days . 
Rat meat was eaten in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s and for some time afterwards when little else was available . 
The poor took to rat meat last year when the price of other meat soared , but younger Cambodians tend to avoid it . 
In Vietnam , rat meat is something of a delicacy . 
Online Vietnamese newspaper , VietNamNet Bridge , said more than 35 metric tons of rat meat a day was imported from Cambodia . 
Cambodian officials said they did not keep records of this aspect of bilateral trade but reckoned the figure was realistic . 
`` The high season for catching rats has returned for the farmers in my district , where I see several thousand kilos of live rats transported every day to Vietnam , '' said Ly Marong , an agriculture official in Koh Thom district on the border . 
Live rats sold for $ 1 per kilo and dead ones -- used for feeding crocodiles in Vietnam -- went for $ 0.37 , officials said . 
`` Some rats are as big as piglets , 2 kilos , and that has intrigued the Vietnamese . 
They see them as wild animals and they find them tasty , '' Marong said . 
Bun Tuon Simona , a Cambodian official in the southern province of Kandal , said the Vietnamese appetite for rat meat has helped a government campaign to get rid of the rodents that were destroying rice fields . 
`` Before , we rewarded farmers with milled rice in exchange for a rat 's tail after they killed one . 
Now it 's not a problem . 
They catch the rat and can sell it to make some money on top of what they get from farming , '' he said . 
Cambodian farmer Chan Pakdeiratha , whose family has rather taken to the meat , said the rats gave birth three times a month and had about 15 babies each time . 
`` If we do n't catch them this year , they 'll destroy our crops next harvest , '' he said .

2009-05-18,"Chronically isolated Taiwan found a powerful new friend over the past year -- its once bitter adversary China . 
But as Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou , a leading figure behind that friendship , reaches his first anniversary in office on May 20 , the two sides have shown they 're ready to back away from each other again . 
Ma 's first year saw what few could have imagined even two years ago , never mind 60 , when Chiang Kai-shek 's Nationalists fled to Taiwan from China after losing the Chinese civil war to Mao Zedong 's Communists . 
China still claims sovereignty over democratic , self-ruled Taiwan and has threatened to take it by force if necessary . 
It has said the two sides must ultimately be united . 
Dropping the hardball that characterised previous Taiwan presidents , Ma 's government has met counterparts from Beijing to work out the first direct flights , a new tourism accord and investment in each other 's markets , all of particular benefit to recession-hit Taiwan . 
Talks leading to those deals lifted mutual confidence to where China has thundered about fighting problems overseas under Beijing 's ethnic unity banner . 
China has asked Taiwan , which is 98 percent ethnic Chinese , to help combat the world financial crisis , implying that both were victims of the U.S. economy . 
More recently it suggested uniting to fight influenza A , which also started overseas . 
What exactly is China 's grand strategy ? 
Diplomats , academics and , yes , journalists have spent countless hours , pulled out innumerable hairs and spilled endless ink trying to figure out where the fast-rising power is headed and what it will want when it gets there . 
But China itself sometimes seems much less sure of its political and economic goals than outside experts believe . 
Great power can breed great uncertainty about what to do . 
A vivid illustration of that came in a speech on Friday by Zhou Xiaochuan , China 's central bank governor . 
Flu bigotry is not a term one usually encounters , but that was the charge hurled at China this week when it quarantined 43 Mexicans , despite none showing symptoms of the H1N1 virus . 
It was not just an anti-Mexican bias , because China followed up by quarantining 22 Canadian students who were likewise free of symptoms . 
Many of the Mexicans had at least been on a plane with a person found to have H1N1 ; there was no apparent direct risk for the Canadians , other than their being from a vast country with only one serious flu case . 
But before accusing China of over-reaction , let alone discrimination , it is worth stepping back to consider the quarantines from Beijing s perspective . 
Just last week , the World Health Organisation said that a pandemic was imminent . 
Some have criticised the WHO for panicking , but governments do not have the luxury to second-guess such an authority when it rings the alarm bell . 
This is all the more true for China . 
Beijing s laggardly response to SARS in 2003 let the disease spread to the point that authorities had to effectively shut the country down . 
Excessive caution this time around has been far preferable . 
The Chinese medical system is still rickety , rural areas lack basic hygiene and buses and trains are overcrowded together combining to make China fertile ground for disease . 
A week-long quarantine is undoubtedly a deprivation of liberty . 
Yet if that is what it takes to prevent a global pandemic , surely the precaution is proportionate to the threat .

REUTERS\/Jason Lee Apr 29 , 2009 09:23 UTC By Niu Shuping and Ken Wills Nevermind that the H1N1 `` swine '' flu , which has killed more than 150 people in Mexico , is not directly caused by pigs and has so far not led to any outbreaks among pigs . 
Nevermind that the World Health Organization has ruled out any risk of infection to humans from eating pork . 
Police should have brought sandwiches and sodas to the park outside a Taipei hotel where Taiwan negotiators and counterparts from old foe China held talks . 
Hardly anyone demonstrated against the mid-April meeting . 
What 's more , over the weekend , as the two sides met more formally in China to sign agreements on trade and finance , Taiwan TV viewers watched news about swine flu in Mexico and the United States or celebrity scandal reruns . 
Monday morning newspapers ' editorials barely raised the usual spectre of Taiwan sacrificing its democratic self-rule to Communist China in exchange for lucrative trade deals . 
Many investors and companies are confident that the second part of the bargain will follow that China 's recovery will be just the cure for markets still woozy from the financial battering . 
Such faith is not yet justified . 
There is a strong element of farce to covering the North Korea story , which should perhaps come as no surprise considering what an unusual , isolated place it is and how hard verifiable news is to come by . 
One never knows quite what to believe , with all the strange stories that seep out about Kim Jong-il 's love of pizza , the rants of North Korea 's official KCNA news agency and numerous other bizarre tales , including these two . 
A proposal to have Chinese `` diving prince '' Tian Liang star as revolutionary model soldier Lei Feng in a television show has prompted an angry response from some of Lei 's former comrades . 
Lei was idealised by Communist propagandists for his selfless spirit and devotion to the Party and the people , though some historians say his legend has been embellished . 
As we gathered on bleachers set up about 30 yards from the waiting staircases , the television crews decided to call Chavez over for an inpromptu question-and-answer session . 
Immediately , the staircases were wheeled away to another spot , more than double the distance from the journalists and certainly well out of earshot . 
A furious argument ensued , as security guards tried to shove reporters back while maintaining some decorum with the embassy representatives . 
Chavez descended the stairs , grinning amidst the chaos . 
At the end of the carpet , he turned and began to talk to reporters , while the Chinese guards tried to edge him towards the cars . 
A few minutes of talking , with no end in sight , made them more impatient . 
Amid a new round of pushing , Chavez himself got bumped . 
North Korea says somewhere up in the sky , a satellite it launched at the weekend is beaming to earth two revolutionary paeans : `` Song of General Kim Il-sung '' for the founder of the reclusive state and `` Song of General Kim Jong-il , '' for the son who succeeded him when he died .

2009-05-18,"Asia worries over H1N1 flu vaccine production HONG KONG | Mon May 18 , 2009 1:35 pm IST HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Asia has shown steely resolve in fighting the H1N1 flu virus with health checks and quarantines , but with more than 90 percent of flu vaccine production capacity located in the West , is less prepared than it wants to be . 
Vaccines are a key weapon to fight any pandemic influenza virus , but the bulk of production is sited in Europe and the United States and health experts and officials in Asia find that worrying . 
`` Do you actually think that in a really serious pandemic that vaccines will be shipped here -LRB- to Asia -RRB- ? '' 
said a microbiologist in Hong Kong , who declined to be identified . 
Even though the new H1N1 appears mild for now , countries like India and Indonesia are keenly aware of their vulnerability and have recently ordered local companies to develop H1N1 vaccines . 
But Asia lacks sophisticated medical technology , experts say , and while it takes an experienced vaccine maker in the west four to six months to prepare a vaccine , Indonesian drugmaker Bio Farma said last week that it would need two years . 
Lily Sulistyowati , an official with Indonesia 's Ministry of Health , said that if the country failed to come up with its own vaccine , it would push the WHO to distribute stocks fairly . 
`` We had the experience with bird flu where we had to line up to buy Tamiflu behind other countries that did n't have any cases . 
Why should we line up when we have the most cases ? '' 
`` We hope that wo n't happen again , we should be given priority if we have more cases than other countries , '' she told Reuters . 
India has invited a number of local drugmakers to submit plans and the government will decide in the coming week which company gets to manufacture the H1N1 vaccine . 
V.M. Katoch of the Indian Council of Medical Research told Reuters : `` We 'll do our best ... We are very confident , whatever we try to do , we do succeed . '' 
In Geneva on Saturday , health negotiators from rich and poor countries failed to clinch a full deal on virus sharing to produce vaccines , but said they had closed gaps on some tough political issues . 
The vast majority of H1N1 cases are in Mexico and the United States but the spread of the disease to at least 39 countries led the WHO to declare a pandemic was imminent at the end of April . 
Its pandemic alert level is now 5 on a 6-level scale . 
The WHO , whose data lags national tallies , earlier put the number of confirmed worldwide cases of the flu strain , a mix of swine , human and avian viruses , at 8,480 , with 72 deaths . 
Ben Cowling , public health expert at the University of Hong Kong , said it would be interesting to see whether governments in Asia forge deals with western vaccine makers . 
`` Many western countries have agreements with vaccine makers . 
That 's why phase 6 alert is a big deal because it means we promise to buy vaccines from you , it gives the vaccine producers the assurance that they need -LRB- to go into production -RRB- , '' he said . 
Nearly all of the world 's flu vaccine factories - which produce 350 million doses annually - are in Europe and the United States . 
They can ramp up production to 500 million doses , but that 's not enough for a global population of over 6 billion . 
China , Japan , South Korea and Australia produce seasonal flu vaccines but these are mostly for domestic use and their combined share make up less than 10 percent of the world 's total . 
`` We are in touch with vaccine makers and have expressed our interest to buy . 
But there are no details as they have not started production yet , '' a Hong Kong government spokeswoman said . 
Some countries are relaxed as the virus appears mild so far . 
Tawee Chotpitayasunondh , head of Thailand 's unit for strategic planning in fighting pandemic flu , said Thailand was `` thinking about vaccine ' but this was not a priority . 
`` The priority now is how to stop the spread among people to prevent secondary spreading , that is what we are fighting now . '' 
Major vaccine makers in the west have already obtained the new H1N1 virus samples from the WHO , but the organization has not decided whether manufacturers should shift their production away from seasonal flu vaccines to targetting H1N1 .

Japan confirmed on Monday 125 people -- many who have not been abroad -- had been infected with the new strain of H1N1 flu , after New York saw its first death from the virus and Chile reported its first two cases . 
GENEVA | Mon May 18 , 2009 2:07 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Humanity may be witnessing an influenza pandemic unfold , the head of the World Health Organization said on Monday , as Japan reported a big jump in infections with the newly-discovered H1N1 virus . 
Flu fears dominated the start of the WHO 's annual congress in Geneva , where many of the 40 countries touched by the flu strain urged the United Nations agency to rethink its pandemic alert scale that is now at the second-highest notch . 
WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said the outbreak that began in North America and has stretched to Europe , Asia and South America needed to be tackled with seriousness even though its symptoms appear to be largely mild . 
`` For the first time in humanity , we are seeing , or we may be seeing , pandemic influenza evolving in front of our eyes , '' Chan told the World Health Assembly meeting in Geneva , where rich and poor governments discussed their drug , vaccine and other needs . 
`` We are all under pressure to make urgent and far-reaching decisions in an atmosphere of considerable scientific uncertainty , '' Chan told the annual congress , which was shortened in length to allow health ministers to go home earlier and resume their monitoring for flu infections . 
Several topics including food safety and viral hepatitis were dropped from the agenda while drug-resistant tuberculosis was initially slated to be postponed and then re-added at the last moment with support from China and others . 
According to the WHO 's latest tally , 74 people have died from H1N1 infection . 
Most of the other nearly 9,000 patients have suffered mild effects like fever and diarrhea from the bug that is a genetic mix of swine , bird and human viruses . 
But its rapid spread between people and across countries has caused the WHO to raise the alert and declare a pandemic is `` imminent , '' a designation that reflects views on the way the new virus is spreading and not the seriousness of its effects . 
Mexico , Britain , China , Egypt , Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates were among those who called at the opening-day session for the WHO to rethink its criteria for declaring a pandemic , which under current rules would occur when the virus is spreading in a sustained way in two regions of the world . 
British Health Secretary Alan Johnson said the `` mechanistic process '' now in place seems to give the wrong public impression about the seriousness of the flu , which can be treated without drugs in most cases . 
Chan , who also fought bird flu and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -LRB- SARS -RRB- in her tenure as Hong Kong health director , said she would consider the request that came just as the number of infections in Japan , Britain and Spain approached critical mass . 
The WHO said its laboratories have confirmed 125 cases in Japan , 103 in Spain and 101 in Britain . 
Officials from its North American stronghold said the virus was still spreading , albeit in a seemingly less virulent form . 
Richard Besser , head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told a high-level session that the H1N1 strain has reached nearly all 50 U.S. states and was likely to circulate worldwide . 
`` While we are not seeing the seriousness of illness that was initially reported in Mexico , the outbreak is not over , '' he said . 
Mexico 's Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said there was a slow but steady fall in the number of cases in his country . 
If H1N1 flu does reach all corners of the world , the WHO 's Chan said there would be certain communities at particular risk -- including people living in slums and shantytowns , pregnant women , and patients with HIV\/AIDS and other health problems . 
Poor countries are seeking international assistance to get drugs , diagnostic tests and medical personnel needed to combat an outbreak which has so far not been identified in Africa or in the world 's most impoverished areas . 
Developing nations are also negotiating fair access to antiviral drugs like Tamiflu and to any vaccines developed to fight the H1N1 strain . 
Officials will also seek an agreement on how samples of the virus should be handled and shared with pharmaceutical companies working to develop vaccines to fight the strain . 
The WHO 's Chan is due to hold meetings on Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and top executives from several pharmaceutical companies , which are waiting for a signal about whether to start making H1N1 jabs or to include the strain in the seasonal flu vaccine mix .

GENEVA | Tue May 19 , 2009 2:36 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots per year in the best-case scenario , the head of the World Health Organization said on Tuesday , as rich and poor countries grappled over limited supplies . 
WHO Director-General Margaret Chan told reporters after her meeting with 30 pharmaceutical companies that `` there are a lot of unanswered questions '' about how many vaccines could be made to protect vulnerable people from the new H1N1 virus . 
`` That is a very optimistic maximum capacity , '' she said of the 4.9 billion estimate , which would be significantly lower if people need more than one injection to gain immunity against the strain or if seasonal flu vaccine-making continues . 
Bringing a new pandemic vaccine to market -- if it goes ahead -- is expected to take 4-6 months , according to the WHO . 
It must be tested first on ferrets and then on humans in clinical trials before regulatory authorities can approve it . 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the news briefing that while the newly-discovered virus strain now appears mild , it needs to be closely watched as it spreads around the world and starts to afflict impoverished countries . 
`` We may be in a grace period with H1N1 but we are still in the danger zone , '' Ban said . 
Earlier on Tuesday , the United Nations chief said it was essential for drugmakers to work with governments to avert the worst potential impacts of the flu , which has killed 79 people and infected nearly 10,000 . 
`` Partnerships with the private sector are absolutely vital , '' he told representatives of the WHO 's 193 member governments gathered in Geneva , urging them to think beyond their borders in their response to the H1N1 strain . 
Though most people infected so far have experienced mild symptoms similar to the common flu , pregnant women and people with HIV\/AIDS , diabetes and other health problems appear to be vulnerable to more severe effects like pneumonia . 
Health experts have said weather could affect the continued spread of the virus , with more cases expected as countries in the southern hemisphere move into winter . 
Flu viruses typically thrive in cold and dry environments . 
Pharmaceutical executives taking part in Tuesday 's vaccines meeting at the WHO 's Geneva headquarters said they were primed to ramp up production of H1N1 vaccines if needed , and would await more directions about how to balance their output . 
`` Our companies stand ready to produce H1N1 vaccines when the recommendation comes from the WHO , '' the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations said . 
Six companies have pledged to make 10 percent of the vaccine they produce available for distribution to poor countries , and eight are in talks about donations , said Gelmer Leibbrandt , general manager of Schering-Plough 's Nobilon . 
Chan said that vaccine makers have shown `` a very serious commitment '' to help the international community prepare for a pandemic of flu , which could be mild in its effects to start and become more severe as it circles the globe . 
Questions remain about whether an H1N1-only vaccine is needed in the near-term -- especially if its production cuts the world 's supply of injections for seasonal flu , which kills up to 500,000 people a year and causes severe illness in millions . 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said pharmaceutical companies should ramp up their production of seasonal flu shots and then later switch to pandemic injection making `` if that is necessary . '' 
`` There is still so much uncertainty about this virus that it is really premature for us to even make a determination about how many people would appropriately be vaccinated , in what order , how many doses will be required , at what point . 
All those discussions are still very much underway , '' Sebelius said . 
Ban , in his remarks to the World Health Assembly , called on wealthy nations to help support poorer states fight the flu . 
But one international official said he expected battles ahead as governments try to secure finite supplies of antiviral drugs and vaccines to protect their populations . 
`` Enabling poor countries to be able to access the various medical supplies they need is going to be a critical political and technical issue , '' he said . 
`` This issue will require political attention . '' 
The WHO has said the world is on the brink of pandemic from the H1N1 virus , which has been most prevalent in North America and begun to infect large numbers in Japan , Britain and Spain .

2009-05-19,"-LRB- Recasts ; adds quotes and byline -RRB- MEXICO CITY May 19 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mexico 's economy will likely be in a clear recovery from recession at the start of 2010 , though Mexican industry will report steep falls in output for several more months this year , Finance Minister Agustin Carstens said on Tuesday . 
Mexico is sinking deeper into recession due to plunging demand for its exports from the United States and many analysts expect the economy will contract about 6 percent this year . 
`` It is a very deep crisis , '' Carstens said , referring to the global recession , which weighs especially heavily on exporting powerhouses like Mexico . 
Mexico reported on Monday that industrial output fell 6.7 percent in March , in the eighth straight month of contraction . 
Industrial production accounts for about 40 percent of the economy . 
`` These are readings that we will continue to see for some more months , '' said Carstens , speaking at an insurance conference . 
At the same time , economists in the United States , where Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports , have increasingly pointed to signs that the U.S. recession is moderating . 
`` The sharp economic contraction and the sensation that demand is in freefall are abating , '' Carstens said . 
`` It is likely that we will start 2010 in a clear recovery , '' he said . 
A rally in Mexico 's peso currency and in global equity markets are signs that investors are betting on recovery , he said . 
The peso MXN = MEX01 rose to its strongest level against the U.S. dollar since November on Tuesday and the local stock market . 
MXX hit its highest level since early October on optimism that the U.S. banking sector may be in recovery . 
The outbreak in April of the H1N1 influenza virus that forced the temporary shutdown of parts of Mexico 's economy is expected to further compound the economic problems . 
Carstens reiterated his forecast that the flu outbreak would shave 0.3 percentage point off gross domestic product . 
Central bank Governor Guillermo Ortiz said on Monday the flu would likely cost 0.5 percent of GDP .

Full Article Mask-wearing de rigeur as flu spreads in Japan TOKYO | Tue May 19 , 2009 10:10 am IST TOKYO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - It was everywhere in western Japan on Tuesday and is showing signs of spreading to heavily populated Tokyo -- not the new H1N1 flu virus , but the wearing of surgical face masks . 
Disposable masks are recommended by the government for those who suspect they have been infected with the new strain of flu . 
But many members of the public are wearing them in an effort to avoid getting infected themselves , though experts say cheap masks , as opposed to virus-proof types , offer little protection . 
Senior Liberal Democratic Party official Hiroyuki Hosoda appeared at a news conference in a mask but peeled it off before speaking to reporters . 
Domestic media showed students on a guided tour of parliament wearing white masks and customers lining up outside stores to stock up on them . 
Long popular with Japanese who want to avoid passing on a cold or breathing in allergenic pollen , masks have become an essential accessory in the western areas of Osaka and Hyogo prefecture , where more than 150 people have been infected . 
Some businesses are ordering their employees , especially those who deal face-to-face with clients , to wear masks . 
`` I pick up passengers from the station , '' one taxi driver told broadcaster TBS . 
`` It 's a bit frightening in this enclosed space -- they might be infected without having developed a fever yet . '' 
Another woman told broadcaster NHK she felt safer in a mask . 
`` A lot of people are wearing them . 
I think it 's best to have one on as a means of prevention , '' she said . 
The government is recommending people use masks as a way of reducing the spread of infection via droplets from coughs and sneezes , but puts the onus on those who are already infected . 
`` If you start to cough or sneeze , please use a mask , '' reads an advice section on the Health Ministry 's website . 
`` If someone in your family or at your workplace is coughing without a mask on , please urge them to wear one . '' 
An official at the ministry emphasised the government was only recommending those with symptoms wear masks . 
`` Unless you are in a very crowded place , masks are not going to help much with prevention , '' he said . 
`` We are not saying that people should always wear a mask when you go out , although it might help to wear one on a rush-hour train . '' 
`` We are certainly not saying that you 'll be safe if you just put on a mask . ''

2009-05-19,"LONDON | Tue May 19 , 2009 7:24 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Deadly pneumonia caused by so-called superbugs are spreading outside hospitals and represent a growing threat to the public , U.S. researchers warned on Wednesday . 
Making the problem more worrying is the recent H1N1 flu outbreak because the `` super-bug '' pneumonia most commonly appears following an influenza-like illness , Alicia Hidron of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta reported . 
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus -LRB- MRSA -RRB- infections can range from boils to more severe infections of the blood , lungs and the sites of surgery . 
Such infections can often be treated only with expensive intravenous antibiotics . 
Most cases are associated with hospitals , nursing homes or other health care facilities but infections acquired in the wider community are increasing , the researcher noted . 
`` Community-acquired MRSA infections are no longer restricted to certain risk groups or to the geographic areas where outbreaks first occurred , '' they wrote in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases . 
`` They now occur widely both in the community as well as health care facilities and have been reported on every continent . '' 
As these superbugs spread in communities , more pneumonia cases are likely -- and the researchers said these may have mortality rates of more than 50 percent . 
`` However , the overall incidence of community-acquired MRSA pneumonia remains unknown , '' the researchers wrote . 
In their analysis , Hidron and colleagues looked at two U.S. cases caused by a specific MRSA strain that is a culprit behind many superbug infections in the United States . 
They reported the pneumonia usually features high fever and low blood pressure with rapid progression to septic shock -- a widespread infection that sends the whole body into a tailspin -- and an urgent need for mechanical ventilation . 
The researchers said they do not know why community-acquired MRSA pneumonia appears so lethal but noted the bacteria that cause it are more susceptible to antibiotics than hospital-acquired infections . 
`` The best treatment of this ... disease has not been defined , '' they wrote .

2009-05-19,"News coverage is a daily activity for me , and however I get involved in a story it s not just a job ; it 's also what I enjoy doing . 
Sometimes I m just an observer behind a camera , but other times I also end up being affected personally . 
When the new H1N1 flu virus broke out in Mexico there was an additional factor for me ; it was impossible not to suffer the first days of the epidemic as the head of a family . 
I thought of the photos that I wanted to take , but I couldn t help thinking of my daughter , my wife and my mother . 
As Colombians living in Mexico City we were all exposed to the unknown virus . 
Fear and uncertainty dominated my family , friends and the millions of people with whom I share the streets of this metropolis . 
Very early on Friday , April 24 , I put on rubber gloves and a facemask that I bought from the corner pharmacy . 
The masks were still easy to find , but a day later their scarcity would become a problem . 
My daughter celebrated along with countless others of her age the sudden onset of vacation , not yet understanding that the break from school would become a virtual quarantine . 
It was recommended that children not leave their homes during the emergency . 
In the early days of the outbreak , the government said that the majority of the victims were young adults , but in normal flu outbreaks children and the elderly are always the most vulnerable . 
Limited knowledge about the disease and the recommended precautions caused Mexico City residents to avoid physical contact , even between people who a day earlier would greet each other with two kisses , as is the custom in Mexico . 
Friends and colleagues began to stand at a distance in hopes of preventing the spread of something that we knew little about . 
But we were learning more about it minute by minute . 
Early news about dying victims was disconcerting . 
Before the government declared that the current flu vaccine was useless for this strain , I went to a vaccination clinic where people were begging for the shot . 
I had hoped to get one for myself to be safe while covering the story , but I was denied as everyone else . 
People left the clinic with fear in their faces and voices when they asked each other , What do we do now ? 
Fearful of catching the flu , I climbed into a taxi to continue covering the outbreak . 
There were fewer people , fewer cars in the city 's normally congested streets . 
The human landscape changed to one of blue-masked pedestrians . 
By the end of the first weekend the population was better informed . 
Most were less frightened in spite of the fact that the virus was among us and spreading . 
Monday was the beginning of the first full week with the virus in Mexico . 
The day was hot and strange , without traffic . 
Then , a few minutes before noon , the earth shook . 
My taxi tilted from left to right . 
Electric cables swung back and forth . 
I grabbed my camera and yelled to the driver , Stop ! 
I jumped out and the near-empty street was still trembling . 
I walked to the corner and saw people rushing out from buildings and houses all around me . 
I could see the fear in their eyes . 
In front of Aragon Hospital the street filled with doctors and patients . 
Some couldn t take the crisis and fainted . 
Dozens of people muttered , ... just what we needed ... At that moment I remembered that my family was alone in our fifth floor apartment . 
I called my wife but she didn t answer . 
I called my daughter s cell phone but again , no answer . 
I kept taking pictures with one hand while calling with the other , and hoping that everything was alright . 
In the end I confirmed that my family was fine and I felt momentary relief , but then I remembered my mother who had died just two days earlier . 
Just one day into the flu coverage , Saturday at 5 a.m. , my mother , who also lived with us in Mexico City , passed away for reasons unrelated to the epidemic . 
In that difficult moment I had called my editors to tell them that I couldn t continue with the coverage plan that day , and I was told to take all the time I needed . 
I had the choice of not working due to my family emergency amidst the sudden appearance of the new flu virus . 
But then I realized that the best therapy for me and the best tribute to my mother would be to go out and report the news . 
Even in the most difficult moments I couldn t stop observing the world and my own life through photography .

2009-05-20,"These students do n't look overly worried about swine flu The global pandemic that is Influenza H1N1 , more commonly known as swine flu , continues its rapid and virulent spread . 
The World Health Organisation reported the number of infected people to have reached 9,830 across 40 countries . 
The virus , which is thought to have originated in Mexico , has now spread as far south as Australia and as far east as Japan . 
With over 170 reported cases , Japan has one of the highest instances of infection in Asia . 
In response , Japan , like many other badly infected regions , has tried to contain any further spread of the virus . 
One measure taken has been the temporary closure of 4,000 schools , colleges and nurseries in and around Hyogo and Osaka . 
Students have been advised to stay at home until further notice but a few restless individuals have found a more entertaining and musical way to spend their new-found free time . 
It appears some Japanese students are not spending their time worrying about the virus , but spending it practising their singing instead . 
In fact , a few karaoke club owners in Japan have reported record numbers of customers . 
One club manager told the AFP news agency : `` We suddenly had a number of high school students after 2pm yesterday , right after the announcement that schools would close for a week . '' 
Neither students nor club owners appear overly worried about the virus . 
So just how concerned should they be ? 
Well , according to a recent statement from Dr Margaret Chan , Director General of the World Health Organization : `` With the exception of the outbreak in Mexico , which is still not fully understood , the H1N1 virus tends to cause very mild illness in otherwise healthy people . 
Outside Mexico , nearly all cases of illness , and all deaths , have been detected in people with underlying chronic conditions . ''

GENEVA | Wed May 20 , 2009 9:15 am EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The number of confirmed cases of the new Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- flu has risen to 10,243 and the death toll has edged up to 80 , the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said on Wednesday . 
Most of the new cases are in the United States , which has seen 5,469 outbreaks of the virus so far , the WHO said as it focuses on the H1N1 virus that has brought the world to the brink of a pandemic . 
Another 51 cases have also been reported in Japan , bringing the total number of cases there to 210 and potentially making it more likely that the WHO will declare a full pandemic after it raised its pandemic alert last month to 5 on a 6-level scale . 
Health ministers and experts at this week 's WHO annual assembly have been discussing how to fight the virus with vaccines and drugs as well as what criteria the WHO should consider when deciding whether to raise the alert level . 
Under WHO rules , signs the disease is spreading in a sustained way in a second region of the world outside its North American epicenter would prompt a declaration that a full pandemic is under way . 
Ministers have urged the WHO to consider other factors such as the severity of the virus before moving to the highest alert . 
Forty countries have confirmed cases of the new strain and nearly all of those who have died were in Mexico , but most patients globally have had relatively mild symptoms .

2009-05-21,"Japanese schools have been taking precautions against the virus Health officials in Japan have confirmed the first cases of swine flu in the densely populated capital , Tokyo . 
Two schoolgirls tested positive for the H1N1 virus after their return from a trip to New York . 
So far , about 250 infections have been recorded in Japan , as a handful of new cases have been reported around Asia . 
Health officials stress there have been no deaths from the H1N1 virus in Japan and most cases have been mild . 
Nearly 10,250 swine flu cases have been confirmed in 41 countries , the World Health Organization says in the latest update on its website . 
The virus is known to have killed 80 people , the vast majority of them in Mexico , where it was first reported . 
Tokyo 's first known case of swine flu was detected in a girl of 16 who arrived back home on Tuesday from New York . 
She had complained of a fever and tested positive for H1N1 . 
She had a cough and sore throat but was recovering well , said Hideo Maeda , secretary of the city 's welfare and health department . 
A second girl on the same trip was also infected , officials later told reporters . 
Tokyo and the surrounding districts are home to around 36 million people . 
Most of Japan 's cases so far have been in areas around the city of Kobe to the west where a high school student who had not been overseas was found to be infected on Saturday . 
Since then the numbers have risen steadily and more than 4,000 schools have been closed as a precautionary measure . 
A 21-year-old Canadian has tested positive for swine flu in Beijing , becoming mainland China 's fifth case of the virus , the Health Ministry reported . 
The man , who is in stable condition , arrived in Beijing on the afternoon of 16 May aboard an Air Canada flight from Toronto . 
Taiwan has also recorded a case of the virus - an Australian doctor who arrived by plane from Hong Kong earlier in the week . 
Australia has reported five new cases , including three young brothers , raising the overall number of confirmed infections to six . 
"
2009-05-21,"As the confirmed number of Japanese infected with the H1N1 flu virus rises , the growing question among many is : Where can we buy face masks ? 
Disposable masks have become an essential accessory in the worst-affected areas of western Japan , while a growing number of Tokyo commuters are wearing them . 
The government has recommended use by those who suspect infection , but some businesses are ordering employees to wear them , especially if they have face-to-face client interaction . 
And Japan 's upper house of parliament is requesting that everyone , including lawmakers , wear a mask when entering the chamber . 
Not surprisingly , some pharmacies and drug stores have run out of stock , while shares of medical mask makers Shikibo and Daiwabo have shot up since the first case was confirmed in Tokyo . 
Osaka-based Shikibo says orders in April alone exceeded by 25 percent the volume of the previous business year , and TV footage shows lines outside stores . 
My cousin in Himeji , Hyogo Prefecture , says more than half the people on the street are wearing masks now and the only reason she is n't is because there are no masks to buy . 
Japan auction site , one box of 100 surgical face masks was auctioned at around $ 280 , compared with the original price of $ 20 . 
One listed on Friday was offered at $ 5,000 for a box of 50 . 
Masks are popular with Japanese who want to avoid passing on a cold or who have allergies , but flu-related demand now seems to be spreading to Tokyo , where `` Sold Out '' signs are becoming more common , along with a rising number of masked commuters . 
Somewhat belatedly , perhaps , public broadcaster NHK stressed that wearing a mask does not provide full protection from catching flu , and once again reminded people to wash their hands .

TOKYO | Thu May 21 , 2009 2:32 pm EDT TOKYO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The spread of the new H1N1 virus in Asia showed no signs of slowing on Thursday as the Philippines recorded its first case and new infections were confirmed in Japan , China and Taiwan . 
In the United States , authorities reported the country 's ninth death from the virus ; a 13-year-old boy in Arizona . 
The H1N1 flu strain is a never-before-seen mixture of swine , bird and human viruses that spreads easily between people . 
It has killed 85 people and infected more than 11,000 in 41 countries , according to the World Health Organization . 
Most of the deaths have been in Mexico , occurring mostly in people with underlying medical problems . 
While it has killed nobody so far in Asia , its grip appeared to tighten on a region that has battled the H5N1 bird flu virus and the SARS virus over the past 10 years . 
The Philippines said a 10-year-old girl , who had returned from a trip to the United States and Canada , had the illness but was recovering . 
The government was contacting people who were on the same flight and asked the girl 's family to put themselves in quarantine until they are declared free of the virus . 
`` There is no community level outbreak in the country , and measures are being taken by the government to prevent transmission , '' said Health Secretary Francisco Duque . 
The number of cases in Japan rose to 272 , including a 16-year-old female high school student in Tokyo who had recently returned from New York . 
About 4,500 schools , mostly in the western prefectures of Osaka and Hyogo about 400 km -LRB- 250 miles -RRB- from Tokyo , have closed until the end of the week and more schools may follow suit . 
In China , authorities confirmed its fifth case , a 21-year-old Chinese-Canadian student in Beijing , while there was also a jump in infections in Australia to eight . 
Taiwan also reported two more cases of the new flu , bringing the number of people with the virus on the island to three . 
Elsewhere , Chile has become one of the most affected countries in South America . 
Sixteen children and adults have tested positive for the H1N1 virus . 
Margaret Chan , head of the World Health Organization , said on Thursday she would raise the global pandemic alert to the top of the six-point scale if the H1N1 flu was spreading globally . 
`` When I see more signals coming from the virus itself or the spread of the disease , including severity , I would not shy away from making a very difficult decision , '' she said , adding health experts were now monitoring carefully for signs the virus has taken hold in the southern hemisphere . 
Chan said progress was being made on an agreement on how to share drugs , vaccines and the viruses needed to make them . 
She said collaboration between governments and drug makers gave hope for conciliation between rich and poor countries . 
`` We have seen something that we have never seen before : the total commitment to countries affected to transparency , to timely reporting , sharing of information , sequences , viruses , diagnostic kits , laboratory equipment , and the list goes on . '' 
So far the symptoms of the new virus appear to be mild , but it is starting to cause more severe effects as it spreads . 
Japanese Health Minister Yoichi Masuzoe said a study on 43 cases in Kobe city suggested it was behaving like seasonal flu , and not everyone affected needed hospitalization . 
But U.S. federal health researchers said the seasonal flu vaccine provides virtually no protection against the new flu . 
Their study also supports an intriguing theory that people over the age of 60 have some immunity to the new H1N1 strain , perhaps because it resembles an older version of seasonal flu . 
They say an unusually high proportion of those being infected and hospitalized with serious disease are young adults , teenagers and older children . 
Seasonal flu , in contrast , is usually far more severe in very young children , people over the age of 65 and people with chronic disease . 
Japan is considering winding down strict health checks at international airports at the end of the week , which had been imposed to try to buy time before an outbreak in the country . 
But for the poorest of countries , there is hardly any protection to speak of . 
In Afghanistan , a medical center has been set up at Kabul airport to deal with possible cases , but the country can not afford temperature screening equipment and relies on other countries to scan outbound passengers . 
The WHO has donated $ 500,000 worth of the antiviral drug Tamiflu , still effective in fighting the new virus . 
That amount , however , covers only 30,360 people -- a mere fraction in a country of 26 million people and where the most basic of medical facilities and drugs are wanting even in the best of times .

2009-05-21,"TOKYO | Thu May 21 , 2009 5:44 am EDT TOKYO May 21 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Shares of Japanese medical mask makers rose on Thursday , a day after the first case of the H1N1 flu virus was confirmed in Tokyo , further fueling speculation of strong demand for masks to prevent infection . 
The government has recommended using disposable masks for those who suspect they have been infected with the new strain of flu , and some businesses are ordering employees to wear them , especially if they deal face-to-face with clients . 
`` Expectations for more demand for masks has grown since the virus has reached Tokyo . 
Shares of mask makers could continue to rise depending on the number of infected patients , '' said Masumi Yamamoto , market analyst at Daiwa Securities SMBC . 
Shares of mask maker Shikibo -LRB- 3109 . 
T -RRB- , which rose 4.4 percent to 190 yen on Thursday , have now nearly doubled their price in the last month . 
Osaka-based Shikibo booked orders for 2 million masks in April -- 25 percent more than the volume it sold in the entire business year ended in March , a spokesman said . 
Rival Daiwabo -LRB- 3107 . 
T -RRB- nudged up 0.3 percent to 344 yen on Thursday , and has climbed 57 percent in the past month as the virus spread internationally . 
Long popular with Japanese who want to avoid passing on a cold or breathing in pollen , masks have become an essential accessory in the western areas of Osaka and Hyogo prefecture , where 172 people have already been infected . 
-LRB- ID : nT320193 -RRB- -LRB- ID : nT233823 -RRB- Daiwabo , also based in Osaka , is churning out its specialised masks as fast as it can after the government asked it to supply more , a spokesman said . 
The company expects to take at least until next month to deliver on all of its April orders alone , he and a sales official said . 
Daiwabo will likely exceed its targeted mask sales of 1.5 billion yen -LRB- $ 15.88 million -RRB- for the nine months ending next month , a spokesman said . 
Still , the impact on mask makers ' earnings and share prices may be short-lived as they are unlikely to boost capacity in view of the current surge in demand , which may soon run out of steam . 
`` The manufacturers will probably only use existing capacity , which I think is a decent decision based on the fact that the virus spread wo n't go on forever . 
So not too much earnings impact is likely , '' said Katsuhiko Hiroshige , general manager of equities trading at Marusan Securities . 
Hiroshige added that masks are popular mostly in Japan and that experts say cheap masks offer little protection anyway . 
`` Buying of these stocks has been mainly by speculative individuals on margin . 
It 's not for long-term investment but quick capital gains , '' he said .

2009-05-22,"Mexico City lifts swine flu curbs Businesses in Mexico City have been hit hard by the flu outbreak Mexico City has lifted all restrictions imposed last month , following an outbreak of swine flu across Mexico . 
Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said no new infections had been reported for a week in the capital and there was no longer a need to wear mask in public places . 
The city virtually ground to a halt at the height of the flu emergency , with schools , bars and cinemas closed . 
Mexico 's flu death toll rose by three to 78 on Thursday , officials said . 
Some 4,000 people have been infected . 
Authorities in the sprawling capital on Thursday lowered its four-level alert system from `` yellow '' to `` green '' - the lowest level . 
`` We can calm down now , '' Mayor Ebrard said . 
`` Now you can come to the city without any risk , '' he said , adding that there was `` no longer any need '' to wear masks in public places . 
However , the mayor urged residents of the city to remain . 
The World Health Organization said on Thursday that 41 countries had reported 11,034 cases of swine flu , or influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection , including 85 deaths . 
The world remains at the second-highest flu alert level , which means an `` imminent pandemic '' . 
"
2009-05-22,"Mexico City lowers swine flu alert Situation under control , relax , there 's no need to wear masks , says mayor Days of mask-wearing in Mexico City could be over . 
Photograph : Reuters\/Eliana Aponte Mexico City lowered its swine flu alert level from yellow to green late last night as the mayor , Marcelo Ebrard , claimed residents could `` relax '' as there had been no new infections for a week . 
Ebrard said the change meant the risk of contagion was low , the situation was under control and the images of countless people wearing blue surgical masks around the city could be consigned to history . 
There 's no longer any need to wear masks , Ebrard said , adding : `` Now you can come to the city without any risk . '' 
With fears of an immediate global pandemic fading , Japan , where there have been almost 300 swine flu cases , also relaxed rules amid fears that the strict regulations could harm the economy and put needless restrictions on the public . 
`` It is important to make it possible for the local government to respond flexibly , depending on the situation of the region , '' the prime minister , Taro Aso , said . 
Under the new guidelines , suspected patients in areas where the number of cases are rapidly increasing would be allowed to go to regular medical clinics rather than only designated `` fever centres '' set up to deal with swine flu , the health minister , Yoichi Masuzoe , said . 
The World Health Organisation today said that 42 countries had recorded 11,168 cases of swine flu , including 86 deaths , since the outbreak was first noticed in Mexico last month . 
In Italy , two secondary schools in Rome have been ordered to close for a week after four students caught the H1N1 flu virus on a trip to New York . 
In Mexico , where 75 swine flu deaths have occurred , the health authorities said no one had been taken to hospital with respiratory infections in the past three days . 
There have been no confirmed swine flu cases since May 14 . 
`` We are seeing a 96 % drop in cases and that 's why we are dropping the alert level to green today , '' the Mexico City health secretary , Armando Ahued , said . 
Since the outbreak was declared on 23 April , Mexico City has spent 4.5 bn pesos -LRB- # 217m -RRB- on medicine and antibacterial gel and to provide incentives for businesses to shut their doors and to clean public spaces . 
A total of 4,008 people have been infected in Mexico . 
The country 's confirmed toll has been rising as scientists test a backlog of samples from patients . 
Ebrard urged Mexicans to remain vigilant , to maintain sanitary conditions in places where crowds gather such as the metro system and schools , and to support a `` culture of health '' . 
`` The big lesson is that we understand what the scientists have been saying for a decade : that we have to be prepared for any possible virus that can appear , '' the mayor said . 
Nearly 80 % of those who died were between 20 and 54 , according to the health department . 
However , many suffered from underlying medical conditions . 
Almost 30 % were obese or had other metabolical problems , and 13 % had cardiovascular problems . 
New test results from the US Centres of Disease Control show that people in their 60s and older have signs of greater immunity to the new swine flu virus . 
Scientists think that is because older people have been exposed to other viruses that are more similar to swine flu than more recent seasonal flu .

GENEVA | Fri May 22 , 2009 3:28 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Countries should be ready for more serious H1N1 flu infections and more deaths from the newly discovered virus , World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan said on Friday . 
The highly contagious strain must be closely monitored in parts of Asia , Africa and South America where the winter season is beginning in case it mixes with seasonal flu and mutates in `` unpredictable ways , '' Chan told the closing session of her United Nations agency 's annual congress . 
`` In cases where the H1N1 virus is widespread and circulating within the general community , countries must expect to see more cases of severe and fatal infections , '' she said . 
`` We do not at present expect this to be a sudden and dramatic jump in severe illness and deaths . '' 
In the WHO 's latest tally , the strain has infected more than 11,000 people in 42 countries and killed 86 . 
Chan told the end of the week-long World Health Assembly that poorer countries need to quickly improve their monitoring for the new flu , which has caused mainly mild symptoms in most patients but could become more serious as it spreads . 
`` This is a subtle , sneaky virus , '' she said . 
`` We have clues , many clues , but very few firm conclusions . '' 
Another senior WHO official , Keiji Fukuda , later told a news conference the United Nations agency was rethinking its criteria for declaring a full H1N1 pandemic is underway to factor in its severity as well as its geographical spread . 
`` What we are looking for and what we will be looking for is something , events , which signify a really significant increase in risk of harm to people , '' said Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director-general . 
The WHO 's global flu alert is currently at level 5 out of 6 , meaning that a pandemic is `` imminent . '' 
Officials from the WHO 's 193 member states have been pushing this week for an altered definition of a Phase 6 pandemic to reduce the risk of unnecessary public panic . 
`` The bottom line here is we are trying to walk a very fine line between not raising panic but also not becoming complacent , '' Fukuda said , adding that criteria would be reviewed now that the assembly had ended . 
The WHO 's current rulebook requires a full pandemic to be declared once the air-borne virus is spreading in a sustained way in two regions of the world . 
The H1N1 strain has been most prevalent in North America and has also caused growing pockets of infection in Japan , Spain and Britain . 
Chan said there was little real difference between the WHO 's current pandemic alert level of 5 and the highest of 6 in terms of preparedness measures taken , and she would consult experts before opting to raise it again . 
`` The decision to declare an influenza pandemic is a responsibility and a duty that I take very , very seriously , '' she said . 
`` I will consider all the scientific information available . 
I will be advised by the emergency committee . '' 
The WHO expects that by the end of May , laboratories will be able to send candidate viruses to drug companies to be tested as vaccine viruses , according to Fukuda . 
`` We are hopeful that by the end of June , by the beginning of July , this will be the time when commercial companies will be in the position of beginning to , or being able to make H1N1 vaccine , '' he said . 
While the new flu virus dominated their meeting , officials also passed resolutions on the need to improve treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis and prepare for a surge in diseases including mosquito-borne malaria due to global warming .

Full Article Philippines says has second case of new flu virus MANILA | Sun May 24 , 2009 12:02 pm IST MANILA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Philippines said on Sunday it recorded its second case of the new H1N1 flu virus , with a 50-year old woman falling sick after traveling to the United States . 
Authorities were observing 10 others for symptoms of the virus , Health Secretary Francisco Duque told reporters . 
Duque said the Filipina had showed signs of the flu a day after arriving from Chicago on May 20 and checked herself into a private hospital . 
`` She only had mild symptoms which include fever and cough , '' Duque said , adding the family and other close contacts of the woman were also being tested for the deadly virus . 
The Philippines first case of the new flu , a 10-year old Filipina who had fever and a cough after traveling from the United States and Canada , has almost fully recovered with only a minor sore throat and would be discharged as soon as repeat H1N1 flu testing was done , Duque said . 
Ten other patients were under observation in the Philippines for the new flu virus that has killed 86 people and infected more than 11,000 worldwide , the health chief said . 
He did not give further details on these patients . 
The World Health Organization is poised to declare a full pandemic of the H1N1 flu virus . 
WHO chief Dr. Margaret Chan said on Friday the world had to be ready for the new swine flu to become more severe and kill more people . 
Asia has yet to record any deaths from the virus , a strain that is a never-before-seen mixture of swine , bird and human viruses that spreads easily between people .

2009-05-25,"The World Health Organisation literally changed the rules of the game while playing it last week , when it said it was rethinking the criteria it would use to declare a global flu pandemic is underway . 
Britain and other countries affected by the newly-discovered H1N1 virus were pushing WHO Director-General Margaret Chan to pause before raising the six-point pandemic scale to its highest notch , as her United Nations agency 's rulebook says she should do once it is spreading in more than one region of the world . 
Those rules were developed in anticipation of a pandemic from the toxic H5N1 bird flu strain , which kills about half those it infects but so far has not passed easily from person to person . 
The WHO activated that alert system when it saw the new strain -- which has genetic pieces of swine , bird and human viruses -- was killing people in Mexico , including the young and seemingly healthy . 
But it caused milder symptoms as it spread worldwide , and health experts now say that many of those infected may not even realize it . 
So does its global spread still represent a pandemic ? 
After weeks of trying to explain that its alert scale is based on the way a potentially dangerous virus is spreading , not the severity of its effects at the present time , the WHO capitulated to pressure and changed its guidance . 
Top official Keiji Fukuda told reporters on Friday that `` what we are looking for and what we will be looking for is something , events , which signify a really substantial increase in risk of harm to people . '' 
This means that although there are pockets of sustained transmission in Japan , Britain , and Spain , the WHO will not have to issue the top alert unless the virus mutates or reverts to a more dangerous form . 
While many nations are congratulating Dr. Chan for adding `` flexibility '' to the pandemic rules , others are raising questions about whether the WHO erred in yielding to the pressure from the mainly-rich countries with confirmed flu infections so far , who would be compelled to cough up money , drugs , vaccines , diagnostic tests , and other technology to poor nations if the world was on edge about Phase 6 flu . 
A less severe threat level means less urgency in addressing those health-system shortcomings that affect not only poor countries ' response to H1N1 , but also other deadly diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria , dengue and cholera . 
While the WHO has said gaps in the world 's `` pandemic preparedness '' must be addressed as a matter of priority , it is apparent that this particular flu is not seen as enough of a trigger do so . 
And that could have as much to do with politics as with science . 
-LRB- Photo : Japanese students wear masks in Tokyo\/Toru Hanai -RRB- It is n't just `` that this particular flu is not seen as enough of a trigger '' to mend the gaps in worldwide preparedness against a pandemic , it is also such that WHO is trying to avoid unnecessary alarm and public unrest .

2009-05-25,"SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico | Mon May 25 , 2009 9:19 pm EDT SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Puerto Rico on Monday reported its first confirmed case of H1N1 swine flu -- a 39-year-old man who had returned from a week-long eastern Caribbean cruise . 
The Dominican Republic said it was stepping up testing of people with flu symptoms after a Russian tourist who had spent 12 days at Punta Cana , the country 's premier beach resort , was detected with the virus after he returned home . 
The authorities in Puerto Rico , a U.S. Caribbean territory , said they were checking on the persons with whom the Puerto Rican man confirmed with the virus had been in contact after he came back from the May 10-17 cruise . 
They did not give details of the cruise ship he had been traveling on . 
`` This isolated case should not be cause for panic , '' Puerto Rico Governor Luis Fortuno told a news conference . 
Dominican Republic 's public health secretary , Bautista Rojas Gomez , said although none of the Caribbean state 's citizens had so far been diagnosed with swine flu , the case of the Russian indicated the virus was present in the country . 
`` The virus is circulating . 
In the last few weeks the number of tourists in the zone has increased enormously and although this is good for the country economically , this increases the possibility of the virus circulating further , '' Rojas said . 
Two Chileans and a Peruvian student who had spent time at Punta Cana were diagnosed with swine flu after leaving the Dominican Republic , according to media reports . 
Caribbean countries ' tourist industries have been hit by the global economic downturn and fears of H1N1 contagion could deal a further blow to economies that look to foreign visitors to earn valuable hard currency . 
Mexico remains the epicenter of the H1N1 outbreak , which the World Health Organization says has been detected in 46 countries and has killed more than 90 people globally .

2009-05-26,"Swine flu outbreak at Birmingham school infects 44 Welford school , hit by biggest outbreak in UK , will undergo ` deep clean ' during half-term holiday Welford primary school in Handsworth , Birmingham . 
Photograph : PA An outbreak of swine flu at a Birmingham primary school led to 44 new cases of the virus being confirmed yesterday , the largest number in a single day since the spread began . 
Pupils at Welford primary in Handsworth , Birmingham , began feeling ill last week when three cases were initially diagnosed . 
Yesterday , lab results confirmed a further 44 infections at the school . 
They included 41 children and three adults . 
Three more people from the east of England and London were also diagnosed , taking the total in the UK so far to 184 , the Department of Health said . 
The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- insisted that high rates of infection were to be expected in school environments where children come into close contact with one another . 
The school is closed this week for half term and expected to open for all pupils who are feeling well next week . 
Before the holidays began , the headteacher informed the HPA there had been an unusually high number of absences owing to illness . 
At least 100 children had been off sick , according to local reports . 
As a result of the first confirmed case , all parents and staff were told either to attend the school over the weekend to collect antiviral medication or to receive medical attention at home . 
A joint statement issued by the school and the HPA , posted on the school 's website , says that it is undergoing a `` deep clean '' of the premises during the holiday before it reopens . 
The headteacher , Chris Smith , was unavailable for comment yesterday . 
The HPA said that all confirmed cases are being treated at home with antivirals and are responding well to treatment . 
HPA officers contacted every parent of children in the school as well as teachers to find out if they have symptoms . 
A spokeswoman for the HPA said that they had not yet identified the source of the outbreak . 
`` The initial case is still under investigation . 
The vast majority of cases have been in people recently returning from an infected country or who have been in close contact with someone who has just returned . 
This is one of a very small number of cases where there is n't that history , '' she said . 
The school recently featured in a BBC2 documentary called The Primary , about building a multicultural school community with children of 17 different nationalities . 
The school has 420 pupils and 60 in its nursery unit . 
Almost 50 countries have now confirmed cases of swine flu and about 13,000 people around the world have been diagnosed with the virus . 
The death toll from the virus in Mexico stands at 83 , while 12 people have died in the United States and two have died in Canada . 
Of four cases confirmed on Monday in the UK , one was yesterday revealed to be a two-year-old boy from Oxford . 
A DoH spokesman said : `` The localized cases of swine flu found in the UK have so far been mild , and we have not seen evidence of widespread community transmission . 
Our strategy of containing the spread with anti-virals appears to have been effective in reducing symptoms and preventing further spread of infection . 
`` But we must not be complacent it is right to prepare for the possibility of a global pandemic . 
The UK 's arrangements are continuing , to ensure that we are well-placed to deal with this new infection . ''

2009-05-27,"Professor Bill Rawlinson , medical virologist , is tracking swine flu 's spread The number of swine flu cases in Australia has doubled in the last day to 59 . 
The government warned that the virus , spreading fast , has been confirmed in most Australian states and territories . 
Health experts have said its rapid transmission was coinciding with the southern hemisphere 's traditional winter flu season . 
The epicentre of the outbreak is in Victoria , where a group of children are among those being treated . 
In New South Wales health authorities have been criticised for not quarantining hundreds of passengers on board a cruise ship where 14 people were diagnosed with swine flu . 
Although some of those who disembarked the vessel in Sydney had complained of sickness , they were allowed to travel home . 
The virus 's spread in Australia has come at the start of the southern hemisphere 's annual flu season . 
Professor Bill Rawlinson from Sydney 's Prince of Wales hospital says the country is preparing for an onslaught . 
`` It is of concern because as we go into winter that is when we see our peak of flu and I think that is why we are all gearing up to deal with this problem and why public health authorities as well as the laboratories as well as clinicians , emergency departments are all putting in place practices that have been developed over other outbreaks such as Sars and the H5 avian strain , '' he said . 
In an attempt to stop the virus spreading to Tasmania , students and toddlers who have recently traveled to Mexico , the United States , Canada , Panama or Japan have been told to stay away from schools and childcare centres for seven days . 
Australia 's federal health minister , Nicola Roxon , has said the number of confirmed swine flu cases was expected to rise significantly in the coming days .

2009-05-27,"PARIS | Wed May 27 , 2009 11:37 am EDT PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - More cases of humans transmitting the H1N1 flu strain to pigs are likely to occur , but will not be a major concern as swine are not severely affected by the virus , the World Organization for Animal Health said Wednesday . 
Canadian health officials said on May 2 a herd of swine in the western province of Alberta had caught the virus from a carpenter who had traveled to Mexico , the epicenter of the H1N1 flu outbreak that has spread to 46 countries . 
It is the only reported case of the virus being transmitted from a human to a pig in the world . 
`` We would not be surprised if we have other cases like this in other countries , '' OIE Director General Bernard Vallat told a news conference at the organization 's general assembly in Paris . 
`` But it is not a problem because we know pigs are not a big player in the epidemiological spread of the disease . '' 
The new H1N1 virus has so far infected nearly 13,000 people and killed 92 around the globe , according to the World Health Organization . 
Vallat reiterated flu viruses easily circulate between species , especially when strains are mixed . 
The new H1N1 virus , popularly known as `` swine flu , '' has human , bird as well as pig origins . 
The OIE , an intergovernmental organization of 174 member states , has often stressed there was no proof so far of transmission from pig to human . 
It was among the biggest opponents against the strain being called `` swine flu . '' 
The World Health Organization has also ruled out any risk of infection from consuming pork , saying the H1N1 flu had not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and prepared pork , or other products derived from pigs .

2009-05-27,"SINGAPORE | Wed May 27 , 2009 4:33 am EDT SINGAPORE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Singapore government on Wednesday confirmed the city-state 's first H1N1 flu case , a 22-year-old Singaporean woman who is being quarantined in hospital . 
The government has been warning Singaporeans for weeks to prepare for an inevitable H1N1 outbreak in the city-state , a regional financial and trading center and the world 's busiest port . 
The woman arrived from New York early on Tuesday on a Singapore Airlines flight , and was not picked up by thermal scanners at the airport as she did not have a fever then , the government said in a statement . 
She was in a stable condition . 
The government said it planned to impose home quarantine on around 60 people , mostly Singaporean passengers on the same flight who were sitting near the flu patient , and it urged them to report to the authorities for anti-viral medication . 
`` This wo n't be the last case in Singapore unless we could stop people from traveling , '' Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan told reporters . 
The government was continuing with screening at border checkpoints and asked people to stay at home if suffering flu symptoms . 
It also advised caution over travel to affected areas . 
Singapore financial markets shrugged off the news . 
Singapore 's central bank said in April that the global outbreak of flu clouded the outlook for the economy .

2009-05-28,"Influenza vaccines can be manufactured on a large scale A viral strain which can be used to make a vaccine against swine flu has been produced by UK scientists . 
It is a `` crucial step '' for manufacturers to start large-scale production of a virus against the H1N1 strain , they said . 
The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control is one of a handful of laboratories globally working towards a vaccine . 
US researchers also recently produced a candidate `` starting strain '' . 
To get a strain suitable for vaccine manufacture , scientists have to create a hybrid virus which is a cross between the H1N1 virus which is causing disease and `` a tried and tested laboratory strain '' . 
Using a technique called reverse genetics the researchers took gene sequences encoding parts of the swine flu virus that are recognized by the body 's immune system and combined them with gene sequences from laboratory strains . 
I am delighted that they have been successful so quickly The aim is to make a virus that is recognized by the human body as the swine flu virus but that is safe and easy to grow up in large quantities by manufacturers . 
It is the same process used for the creation of seasonal influenza vaccines that are produced every year . 
Without these `` starting strains '' vaccine production could not begin . 
The candidate strain is now being made available to the pharmaceutical industry and other flu laboratories . 
The UK government has deals in place with Baxter and GlaxoSmithKline for up to 90m doses of a swine flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- vaccine by December . 
Once a pandemic is declared , there is provision for everyone in the UK to get two doses of a vaccine . 
For something of such potential importance as a pandemic flu vaccine , it 's good to know there are several teams working on it Dr Stephen Inglis , director of NIBSC , said their scientists had been `` working around the clock '' since they received the first isolate of swine flu from colleagues in the US at the beginning of May . 
`` I am delighted that they have been successful so quickly . 
`` The strain is now available for supply to vaccine manufacturers so that they can begin the first steps in the vaccine production process , and to other flu laboratories around the world for research . 
`` Our WHO network colleagues in the USA and Australia are also making good progress and we expect there soon to be a number of possible strains to use for large scale manufacture of swine flu vaccine . ''

2009-05-28,"Eton College had been due to re-open on Sunday after half-term Public school Eton will close for a week after a pupil tested positive for swine flu , a school spokesman has said . 
The Berkshire boys ' school , which was attended by Princes William and Harry , was informed on Wednesday that a 13-year-old boy had tested positive . 
Health authorities advised the school to shut until 7 June . 
It comes after health officials announced a further 17 people in the UK were diagnosed with the virus , taking the total number of cases to 203 . 
Fourteen of the new cases - 13 children and one adult - are part of an outbreak now totalling 64 cases linked to Welford Primary School in Birmingham . 
Welford is carrying out a `` deep clean '' while closed for half-term . 
Two adults in London and a child in east England make up the other new cases of the H1N1 virus , reports the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- . 
The London cases involve one returning traveller and one linked to a previously confirmed case . 
Eton College , near Windsor , is currently closed for half-term and had been due to re-open on Sunday 31 May , but will now remain closed for another week . 
A school spokesman said the boy had a mild illness and was recovering at home . 
It 's a balance between minimizing the risk of a spread on the one hand - which is the national interest - with this all-important time for boys The school 's bursar , Andrew Wynn , told the BBC News website the decision to keep the school closed had , in effect , been taken by the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- . 
`` The school is hardly likely to ignore the strong advice of the HPA . 
We have had long discussions all day with them , '' he said . 
`` Clearly they are wanting to stop the spread of it . '' 
Boys taking public examinations are being allowed to return to do so under controlled conditions . 
`` One of the things we have agreed is that boys be allowed back to take their exams , '' said Mr Wynn . 
`` So it 's a balance between minimizing the risk of a spread on the one hand - which is the national interest - with this all-important time for boys . '' 
He said it was too soon to have had any reaction from parents . 
Worldwide there have been 95 deaths reported from swine flu and an estimated 13,450 cases . 
Eton College was founded by King Henry VI nearly 570 years ago . 
It has 18 British prime ministers , including the Duke of Wellington , Sir Robert Walpole and Harold MacMillan , among its former pupils .

2009-05-28,"Swine flu shuts Eton as UK cases pass 200 cents Eton advised to close until 7 June after boy contracts virus cents Swine flu confirmed in 14 more people at Handsworth school Eton College . 
Photograph : Matthew Fearn\/PA Eton has closed temporarily after a pupil was diagnosed with swine flu , as the total number of cases in the UK rose above 200 . 
The Berkshire school was told yesterday that a 13-year-old boy had tested positive for the H1N1 virus and was advised by health authorities to shut until 7 June . 
The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- today announced a further 17 cases of the disease , bringing the total to 203 . 
The new cases include 13 children and an adult at Welford primary school in Handsworth , Birmingham , which has already been linked to 50 cases of the virus . 
A spokesman for Eton said : `` The boy has a mild illness and is now recovering at home . 
The school is currently closed for half-term and had been due to reopen on Sunday May 31 . 
`` The Health Protection Agency has strongly advised that the school should close in line with national guidance . 
Following discussion with the HPA , the school plans to remain closed until June 7 , and boys who are due to sit public examinations will be allowed to return under controlled conditions . '' 
He said the HPA was checking on pupils who had been in contact with the boy , adding : `` The objective is to minimize the risk of spread of infection , while allowing boys to take their public examinations . '' 
Another cluster of cases continues to grow in Glasgow , where it emerged that a primary school child living next door to the man critically ill in hospital was being treated as a probable case . 
The child 's school , Annette Street primary , has been closed and the child 's classmates given the antiviral drug Tamiflu as a precaution . 
Two other pupils at the school who have already been identified as confirmed cases are children of the 37-year-old man , who has other health problems and is now in an isolation ward at Victoria infirmary in Glasgow . 
His wife and their third child also have the virus . 
A Department of Health spokesman said these cases had so far been mild , with no evidence of widespread transmission in the community . 
`` Our strategy to slow the spread of the disease appears to have been effective , and the UK 's arrangements continue to ensure that we are well-placed to deal with this new infection , '' he said . 
Nicola Sturgeon , the Scottish health secretary , added : `` We will continue to see incidents of H1N1 across the country and the lessons learned from each of these will help us in our ongoing efforts to disrupt the spread of the virus . '' 
The HPA disclosed today that British scientists had created a genetically engineered strain of the swine flu virus suitable for vaccine manufacture , which will now be given to drugs makers and laboratories worldwide . 
Scientists at the HPA 's research lab near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire , one of a World Health Organisation network of laboratories involved in the research , have produced a hybrid flu strain by combining parts of the H1N1 virus with a laboratory strain . 
The move was a `` crucial step '' towards large-scale production of a vaccine , the agency said . 
Scientists in the US and Australia have produced other strains suitable for vaccine manufacture .

2009-05-28,"GENEVA | Thu May 28 , 2009 11:54 am EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Scientists have used bird flu virus samples from Egypt to develop a new basis for a vaccine against the toxic H5N1 strain that continues to circulate , the World Health Organization said on Thursday . 
Avian influenza kills about half the people it infects , but unlike the quickly circulating H1N1 flu virus has not been shown to pass easily between humans to date . 
The WHO said the candidate virus was developed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta `` thanks to the ministry of health and population of Egypt , for providing virus specimens , '' `` This recombinant vaccine virus is available for distribution , '' it said in a statement on its website . 
`` Institutions , companies and others interested in pandemic vaccine development who wish to receive these candidate vaccine viruses should contact either the WHO Global Influenza Program ... or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . '' 
Pharmaceutical companies including Novartis are already working on vaccines against H5N1 bird flu , which has killed or forced the culling of more than 300 million birds since 2003 as it spread to 61 countries in Asia , the Middle East and Africa . 
While eclipsed on the headlines by the highly contagious H1N1 strain , which proved deadly in its North American epicenter but has caused mild symptoms as it spread , the WHO stressed it was important to remember the risks posed by avian influenza . 
The U.N. 's Food and Agriculture Organization reported 250 outbreaks of H5N1 in birds in February alone -- in Bangladesh , China , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Laos , Nepal and Vietnam . 
Avian influenza has killed 261 people out of 424 infected since 2003 . 
By contrast , the H1N1 strain , commonly known as swine flu and which has put the world on pandemic alert , has infected more than 13,000 people but killed just 95 , according to WHO figures . 
Its statement on Thursday said flu experts were continuing to monitor the evolution of avian influenza and other flu viruses and stressed the need for countries to keep providing samples of identified strains . 
`` Countries are encouraged to share with WHO their specimens and\/or isolates , both from humans and animals , for their inclusion in the WHO H5N1 vaccine virus development and selection process , in addition to other activities of public health significance , '' it said . 
Virus sharing is a sensitive topic for developing countries such as Indonesia , who have bristled at the idea of companies using their biological material to manufacture and patent vaccines that are then sold at unaffordable prices . 
WHO Director-General Margaret Chan , who raised the United Nations agency 's pandemic alert to 5 out of 6 in response to the fast spread of swine flu , is trying to broker an international agreement on the sharing of virus samples by January 2010 . 
She has called on countries to do all they can to ensure fresh samples of both H5N1 and the new H1N1 strains reach the pharmaceutical community so that their vaccines can offer immunity against the latest forms of the viruses . 
The WHO 's statement did not include new guidance on the H1N1 virus or vaccines to fight it . 
WHO officials have said they would offer recommendations `` during the summer '' about how many pandemic vaccines focused on that strain may needed , depending on whether it continues to cause mild effects as its spreads . 
British scientists have produced a strain of H1N1 flu virus which could be used for large-scale production of a vaccine , should it go ahead . 
That strain is being made available to the pharmaceutical industry and other flu laboratories , Britain 's Health Protection Agency said on Thursday , describing it as `` a crucial step toward large scale production of a vaccine against swine flu . ''

2009-05-29,"James Reynolds | 07:37 UK time , Friday , 29 May 2009 China is taking the H1N1 threat pretty seriously . 
Arriving at Beijing 's airport right now is a bit like turning up at a laboratory . 
I 've just come back to Beijing following a few days in the UK . 
As our flight came in to land , the cabin crew handed out H1N1 health forms issued by China . 
These forms asked us to list our seat number and our contact numbers in Beijing . 
We also had to answer the question : `` Have you had close contact with pigs within the past week ? '' 
When we landed , we were told to stay in our seats . 
A team of Chinese health inspectors wearing masks then boarded the plane . 
The inspectors proceeded slowly down each row , pointing what I can only describe as a temperature gun at each passenger 's forehead -LRB- we made their jobs easier by politely tilting our foreheads to the inspectors as they went by -RRB- . 
A few minutes later , the inspectors escorted one passenger in an orange t-shirt off the plane . 
He looked pretty embarrassed . 
Inside the airport terminal , we passed through a further two checkpoints staffed by guards checking for anyone with a fever . 
Leaflets warned us : `` It is the responsibility of every citizen to self-monitor at home for seven days after coming back from abroad . '' 
In case that man with the orange t-shirt is diagnosed with H1N1 , the Health Ministry has enough information to track us all down and put us all into quarantine for a week . 
This report is objective , good work James ! 
And , thank you for being polite and cooperative in the inspection process . 
Wish the flu can come to an end soon . 
So this is pretty much an admission from the CCP that SARS was handled appalingly .

However , travellers should fully understand that it is good for everybody .

There is not any effort to cover nose\/mouth with hand or handkerchief , but instead the viruses get nicely spread around everyone . 
My employers frequently complain that the commuters in our office are ill - I think the reason is obvious ! 
Just on Wednesday I saw something that made me laugh : A young lady wearing a face mask . 
I thought to myself `` At last ! 
A responsible fellow citizen ! '' 
But no , a few moments later she slipped off the face mask , sneezed violently into the air and slipped the mask back over her mouth and nose . 
Nonetheless , it is good to see this approach in airports , and while it will inconvenience passengers , it is hard not to argue that the steps are necessary .

China is a heavily populated country . 
Virus such as this one will spread quickly if no effective control is implemented . 
People who are complaining about the inconvenience of all the safety procedures can only be called selfish . 
People who are currently infected with the virus without knowing it will also benefit from these tests and procedures , since early detection is always beneficial . 
The Chinese government obviously had learn plenty from previous outbreaks .

The H1N1 and H1N5 always have the potential to mutate and become a potential danger on a global scale . 
If everyone took such actions the threats of pandemics would be greatly reduced . 
As seen with the H1N1 the spread across the globe was rapid and is still spreading . 
Public health is a primary responsibility of government , I think these actions are prudent and necessary . 
In high density cities a major outbreak would be difficult to control .

2009-05-29,"Swine flu spreading faster in UK than anywhere else in European Union Britain is the only member state where more people have caught the disease at home than abroad , raising concerns about the effectiveness of public health measures Friday 29 May 2009 16.55 BST The swine flu information leaflet produced by the UK Department of Health . 
Photograph : Tim Ireland\/PA Swine flu is spreading more rapidly in Britain than anywhere else in the European Union , according to the latest figures on the outbreak . 
European health officials confirmed that as of this morning , 456 people had caught the H1N1 virus across 21 EU member states , with almost half of those infected living in the UK . 
More concerning is that the virus appears to be spreading more quickly from person to person in Britain than elsewhere , raising questions over public health measures to contain it . 
Most European cases of swine flu are people who have flown home after picking up the infection in Mexico or the US . 
Britain is the only member state where more people have caught the disease at home than abroad . 
Figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show that of 203 confirmed cases of swine flu in Britain , 146 people caught the virus without leaving the country . 
In Spain , which has 143 confirmed cases , only 43 people caught the infection at home . 
Sheila Bird , professor of biostatistics at Cambridge University , criticised Britain 's Health Protection Agency for failing to publish the information , which emerged only in a European report on the epidemic . 
`` When you see a big difference in the rate of person-to-person transmissions between the UK and other countries , the immediate questions are is this due to better surveillance in the UK , or is it due to poorer public health measures ? '' 
`` It 's not just scientists who need to know this information . 
In the prevention of a new infectious disease , part of the work is done by the public , and they need to know what to be alert to , '' she added . 
A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency said outbreaks at schools in London and Birmingham had contributed `` significantly '' to the spread of the disease within Britain . 
Yesterday , the Department of Health reported 12 new cases in England , bringing the UK total to 215 . 
The new cases include 10 children from Welford Primary School in Handsworth , Birmingham , where 60 cases have already been confirmed . 
The other two cases include a child in London and an adult in the north-west , who caught the infection from an unknown source . 
On Thursday , a seriously ill 37-year-old man was admitted to the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow with the infection . 
Eton College in Berkshire was closed for a week from yesterday after a 13-year-old pupil was diagnosed with swine flu . 
There have been 8,585 probable and confirmed US cases of the the new H1N1 strain , with 12 deaths and 507 hospitalisations . 
Work has begun on a swine flu vaccine , which is expected to go into clinical trials in the next few months . 
But it is unlikely to be ready for widespread use until October . 
A spokesman for the Health Protection Agency said : `` The agency is committed to keeping the public and health professionals up to date with the current situation on swine flu . 
We publish figures every day to provide the latest on confirmed cases and have lots of guidance and advice on our website - hpa.org . 
uk - including information on whether the infections were acquired here or abroad , what age groups are being affected and other important epidemiological data . ''

2009-05-31,"It 's crunch time for corn . 
Grain traders are anxiously waiting USDA 's weekly crop progress report late Monday as it will tell the story of how U.S. corn was planted this season . 
As of May 24 , American farmers still had 15 million corn acres of a projected 85 million yet to plant as heavy spring rains in the eastern Corn Belt delayed planting by at least 10 days to two weeks in many areas . 
Midwest acres seeded after mid-May usually lose more than a bushel a day on yield . 
`` Analysts are wondering how many of the remaining 15 million acres will be planted to soybeans rather than corn , '' Mike Woolverton , Kansas State University grain economist , said in his weekly newsletter . 
`` The consensus guess is one million acres if it immediately stops raining in the eastern Corn Belt and Mid-south ; up to two million acres if it stays wet , '' he said . 
Oil is a multi-billion dollar , multi-million barrel serious business . 
But OPEC ministers hounded by a ravening press pack can be masters of jocularity when the mood takes them . 
The relaxed tenor of this week 's OPEC meeting , which could cheerfully roll over existing output targets given the market was intent on rising whatever , was reflected in a high quota of light-hearted brush-offs . 
Libya 's Shokri Ghanem , renowned for his impishness , told one reporter he was going `` to have a cup of coffee '' when asked on the day of the meeting what his agenda was . 
It was n't quite the `` keep output steady '' the reporter had been after . 
Questioned about the oil price , Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman said : `` Could be better , but I ca n't complain . '' 
He could just as easily have been talking about the weather or his state of health . 
The most senior minister of them all Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi was in particularly sporting mood as he sped through Viennese hotel lobbies , jogged around the Vienna Ring and declared all was right with the world . 
`` The price is good , the market is in good shape , recovery is under way . 
What else could we want ? '' 
As the oil price climbed above $ 65 a barrel , its highest for more than six months , sceptical reporters asked whether the rally could be sustainable when oil inventories were still very high . 
But Naimi was confident the great healer would take care of excess supply . 
`` Time takes care of everything , '' he said and no-one could disagree . 
Tony Hayward did it at BP in 2007 and Peter Voser , due to step up to the top job at Royal Dutch Shell Plc on July 1 , did it on Wednesday . 
May 26 , 2009 20:21 UTC OPEC 's president Angola might well be asking himself why he is paying nearly 2 million euros to belong to the oil producers ' club when the World Bank has told the nation it would be better off without it . 
The Angolan energy minister , who currently holds the group 's rotating presidency , has yet to arrive in Vienna for this Thursday 's meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , which is expected to keep existing output targets unchanged . 
Member countries have already agreed to lower production by 4.2 million barrels per day since last September and have been delivering around 80 percent of the promised curbs . 
Now the oil price has climbed back above $ 60 a barrel , almost double the lows of last December , members like Angola might well sigh with relief and pump even more above their OPEC output target than they are already doing . 
Last week , the World Bank said Angola 's economy would perform far better this year if the country did not limit production , as OPEC has requested , and that was n't taking account of the OPEC membership fee , which is heard to be the same for all members , whether they are the smallest producer Ecuador or the biggest Saudi Arabia . 
Oil ministers might have saved a night or two on hotel accommodation , however , as several were expected to arrive later than originally stated and also to disappear immediately after Thursday 's meeting . 
Delegates predicted it would be short and to the point , provided Angola and others unhappy with output targets did not open a Pandora 's Box of a debate on production goals . 
The controls are aimed at supporting oil prices as the market is already well-supplied , but some argue a better way to boost OPEC earnings would have been to call the meeting off . 
It would not be good business for Vienna hotels or struggling airlines , but it would cut the expenses and carbon emissions of the OPEC delegations and the pursuing press pack , as one weary analyst observed . 
`` We are forced to mention that there is an OPEC meeting this Thursday in Vienna , although there is so little to expect out of it that OPEC could have made a gesture to save its and the media 's carbon footprint by calling it off , '' said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix .

2009-06-01,"Fergus Walsh | 14:07 PM , Monday , 1 June 2009 One of the UK 's leading flu experts has predicted that a pandemic of swine flu is likely to strike Britain in the autumn . 
Professor John Oxford , an expert on virology at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , says that children going back to school , universities reopening and people going back to work after the summer break would give swine flu the `` opportunity '' that it needs to spread . 
Another fifteen cases of swine flu were confirmed yesterday by the Health Protection Agency , bringing the UK total to 244 . 
One of the cases was in Wales and is believed to be the first there . 
But Professor Oxford thinks that many cases are going undetected : `` Already , sporadic cases in the UK have been shown that are not linked with cases that have traveled . 
That does suggest that the virus is silently spreading around . '' 
However , he said that people should behave as usual , as far as possible , if a pandemic strikes . 
`` What we do n't want is people stopping at home and not going to work , because then you have an economic problem on top of a pandemic , '' he said . 
`` The best advice is to carry on as normal but to be sensible about it . 
`` This includes a bit of social distancing and shielding people from coughs by coughing into the crux of your arm . '' 
Professor Oxford said that in the next few months , global health officials will be keeping a close eye on what happens to the H1N1 swine flu virus in countries like Australia and South Africa . 
The southern hemisphere is entering its winter and the peak period for flu . 
On Friday , the World Health Organization reported that Australia has had 147 confirmed cases ; Argentina has had 37 ; and none so far in South Africa . 
What happens in the southern hemisphere in the coming months will be a good indicator of how the virus will behave in Europe and North America later this year . 
There would be particular concern if H1N1 mutated substantially to become a more virulent illness . 
Thankfully , there are no signs of that yet . 
The Australian Science Media Centre is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know what experts are thinking about the spread of the virus there . 
The Science Media Centre in London has lots of reliable specialist comments on flu and a host of other issues .

If a million people had died in Mexico we would have something to worry about , but as it is this flu seems no worse than normal flu , even though it has an unusual origin . 
Unusual does not equate to dangerous and I wish that the relative risks had been far better explored before the Beeb had decided to follow the herd and jump off the deep end . 
Thousands of people die of flu every year , whilst millions die of diahorrhea so perhaps you could instead whip up some hysteria where it is 100 % justified and could genuinely help to reduce the number of preventable deaths in the world .

I believe they predicted that 25 % -50 % of the population would catch swine flu at some stage - probably next winter . 
Of these , 0.25-1 % would die . 
So the scenario for swine flu related deaths in the UK is : Anywwhere between 37,500 and 300,000 deaths . 
I presume these numbers were a prediction for the next 12 months . 
I do n't believe this is reason to panic . 
It is , however , reason to have some concern . 
One would expect hospitals and health care to get very stretched , probably overstretched , in six month 's time . 
One would expect some level of disruption . 
The scariest thing : One would expect to experience a bereavement in the next year . 
This flu is not the equivalent of the Great War - but neither is it just the equivalent of a Heat Wave , in terms of its likely impact . 
I find advice telling people to sneeze hygienically stupid : It does not benefit the sneezer , and it only might benefit the sneezed at people . 
I do n't want advice on `` how to keep your illness to yourself '' - I want advice on `` how to not get ill , or minimize the impact if you do '' . 
If I were the government , I would advise people to try and keep their immune system strong this year , at least until the flu season has passed . 
If that means healthier living and less excess for a year , then so be it . 
I 'd rather catch the flu after spending six months eating and drinking sensibly , than after weeks of poor nutrition and binge drinking . 
As for Tamilflu - I would like to know how bad the side effects are -LRB- and the likely mortality from those -RRB- before I 'd consider taking it .

It just means a disease outbreak that has spread around the world , not doomsday . 
The word describes the spread of a disease , not its lethality . 
By saying that a swine flu pandemic is imminent neither the BBC nor the government or universities are guilty of scare-mongering . 
People who accuse them of being so are guilty of being too lazy to use a dictionary or check the WHO website . 
By the way , I 'm a virologist and I 'm sticking with calling it swine flu rather than H1N1 because it has been shown to be mostly from swine lineages . 
There are so many circulating H1N1 strains of human origin that calling it swine flu is about as helpful as telling a policeman that you were hit by a silver car , instead of a Toyota Corolla with licence plate ABC 1234 .

Mr Fergus Walsh could at least bring some of the new learning into the discussion . 
It should not be up to us , the bloggers and twitters to spell out necessary changes to government and populations that are needed to reduce the speed of infection to a manageable rate . 
One of the ideas put forward is the protection of agency workers , to enable them to go off sick if they become ill . 
Many agency workers have to take risks and work whether they are ill or not , because they are not covered by the usual protection that a regular employee enjoys . 
A regular employee can take comfort in the fact that they know which days they will be working , have holiday pay , have normal sickness benefits etc etc. . 
An agency worker is called in to cover a worker who has gone off SICK . 
The government has already advised certain work groups to keep a list of agencies to whom they can get cover when their workers go off sick . 
Should there now be greater protection for agency workers ? 
After all agency workers help out when there is no-one else available , and without them , some key work areas could find themselves seriously compromised . 
Very mild symptoms which would have been missed if I had n't found out by chance that she 'd had contact with a confirmed case at school . 
That was last Thursday . 
So far neither my husband nor I have any symptoms and our daughter has fully recovered . 
She was given Tamiflu to hasten recovery , but we would prefer not to take it ourselves as we do n't have any symptoms and want to build up our own immunity in case this flu returns in a nastier form . 
Our family has been quarantined , but the ` contain ' policy is being reviewed as more schools are closing and more cases confirmed . 
Victoria -LRB- where we live -RRB- has the majority of cases in Australia - almost 400 here alone . 
My suggestion is to be cautious and let common sense prevail . 
There is a lot you can do to prevent the spread of flu , but it 's proven to be more of an inconvenience than a threat so far . 
Thanks to drmattprescott for your comments . 
Have a good look in the blog and on the BBC coverage and I 'm confident that you wo n't find any hysterical claims from correspondents about swine flu . 
If you watched the Six or Ten o'clock news on BBC1 on Friday you would have seen me do a report about the threat of drug-resistant malaria . 
I have also reported several times on HIV\/AIDS , TB and child mortality - from a variety of causes - including diarrhoea . 
You are quite right to say that thousands of people die from flu every year - the WHO global estimate is 250,000-500 ,000 . 
I have pointed this out several times . 
Death estimates for flu are not simple but it 's thought that between one and two million people died in each of the last two pandemics , many times more than with seasonal flu . 
Clearly that is not as many as die from malaria , TB and HIV\/AIDS , but a pandemic , even of largely mild illness , would have a huge impact both in the UK and internationally . 
In Britain , hundreds of thousands of people might be off work during the peak periods of infection and that would have a major economic and social impact - far more than with seasonal flu . 
I ca n't give personal health guidance on this blog - not least because I 'm not medically qualified . 
If you are ill you should probably seek medical advice of some kind , via NHS Direct , or NHS 24 in Scotland . 
It 's generally not a good idea for people with coughs , colds or flu to take the virus down to their GP surgery . 
Hope you feel better soon . 
Thanks for your comments Ikarus . 
An earlier post `` Explaining flu '' gives you the predictions about mortality in the UK in a pandemic . 
Like all drugs , Tamiflu has potential side-effects , nausea being a common complaint . 
RE Comment 5 : Let me clear up any confusion about what Professor Oxford 's comments . 
He is advising that healthy people should carry on life as normal , in the event of a pandemic , although they should follow sensible hygiene guidance . 
But sick people should stay at home and keep the flu virus to themselves . 
RE Comments 6 and 7 . 
It 's interesting that the CDC and WHO stopped calling it swine flu sme time ago . 
The CDC goes for `` novel influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- '' and the WHO `` influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection '' . 
Both are a bit of a mouthful for when I 'm reportng on TV or radio . 
I tend to call it H1N1 swine flu when I mention it first and then shorten that to swine flu or H1N1 virus afterwards . 
RE Comment 9 , thanks very much for getting in touch . 
It 's very good to know what is happening on the ground in Australia and to hear that your daughter is ok . 
Please let me know how she gets on with the Tamiflu and whether she suffers any of the reported side-effects such as nausea -LRB- which seem to be very mild -RRB- . 
I 'd be interested to get some first-hand accounts of the disease and the treatment .

You say `` no reason to panic '' but in the next breath seem to be saying `` people can expect one of their loved ones to die within the next year from swine flu '' ! 
Thanks for your comments MajorGallagher . 
Please point out to me where I suggest that someone close to you is going to die from swine flu in the next year ? 
I have never intended to imply that . 
Remember that `` pandemic '' means simply a global epidemic of an infectious disease . 
It does not imply severity . 
Thankfully , the vast majority of cases of swine flu so far have been mild . 
At present you need to have underlying health conditions or be very unlucky to be struck down severely ill with the virus . 
But the case of the 45-year-old man in hospital in Paisley - who had been otherwise healthy - shows that H1N1 is not always a mild disease .

Our daughter had no side effects from taking Tamiflu , but I read in the weekend paper about overseas findings of suicide tendencies in some young people after taking it . 
Neither my husband nor I had any flu symptoms at all despite being in close contact with our daughter the whole time . 
I understand that the authorities would only test for H1N1 if there had been contact with a confirmed case , even if someone had flu like symptoms . 
Consequently I heard of children who were ill , but not tested as there was no known contact with a confirmed case . 
The authorities in Victoria have struggled to deal with this epidemic and it 's easy to see how a pandemic of a more serious nature could claim many lives world wide .

2009-06-01,"WASHINGTON | Mon Jun 1 , 2009 4:17 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Cases of the new H1N1 flu virus have been found in all 50 U.S. states and tests have confirmed the virus in more than 10,000 people across the country , U.S. officials said on Monday . 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the confirmed tests represent about one in 20 of the actual number of infections , which would bring the total number of U.S. cases to around 200,000 . 
California health officials reported the state 's first two deaths from the swine flu virus , bringing the nationwide total to 19 fatalities . 
Both involved middle-aged people , a man from San Bernardino County and a woman from Los Angeles County , who had pre-existing medical conditions . 
`` While , overall , we have seen predominantly mild flu cases in the state , these fatalities remind us that all flu viruses can be deadly , including the H1N1 flu , '' Dr. Mark Horton , director of the California Department of Public Health , said in a statement . 
California has identified 802 people with confirmed or probable cases of the disease , with 47 requiring hospitalization . 
Most of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions that included lung disease , weakened immune systems and heart disease , and a smaller number had diabetes or were obese or pregnant . 
The virus , which spreads easily and causes mostly mild disease , has been diagnosed in 17,564 people in 64 countries , killing 115 , according to the World Health Organization . 
It was found this week in patients in Bulgaria , Vietnam and Jamaica . 
Although H1N1 swine flu appears mild , it affects mostly older children and young adults , and experts worry it could change into a more dangerous form .

L -RRB- MedImmune biotechnology unit has won an initial $ 90 million order from the U.S. government to make a live attentuated vaccine against the new H1N1 flu strain , it said on Monday . 
The potential exists for further additional orders from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -LRB- HHS -RRB- , it said . 
MedImmune 's vaccine technology , currently only available in the United States , is different from traditional injectable flu shots in that it is a mist sprayed into the nose , where the flu virus usually enters the body . 
It contains live , weakened virus that does not cause the flu but still prompts the body to mount an immune response . 
The HHS said on May 22 it was setting aside $ 1 billion to help companies develop vaccines against the new strain of H1N1 influenza sweeping the world . 
Experts say a vaccine against the new strain -- also known as swine flu -- would probably have to be given separately from the seasonal flu vaccine , which is a mixture of three flu strains reformulated every year . 
Vaccine makers are almost done with making the autumn flu vaccine for the northern hemisphere . 
MedImmune plans to begin shipping the first of 10 million doses of its seasonal FluMist vaccine to U.S. healthcare providers in August .

The Communist Party is trying to remove all references to the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests and the subsequent massacre on June 3rd\/4th . 
An official chronicle of China 's recent history may look a bit like this : 1985 , 1986 , 1987 , 1988 , 1990 , 1991 , 1992 etc. . 
In China right now , it 's as if the year 1989 simply never happened . 
In the last few days , we 've noticed a handful of unusual things ... When my colleagues and I went to film in Tiananmen Square last Friday , we were stopped four times by the police -LRB- normally we 're checked just once . -RRB- 
Officers told us that we were not allowed to use our camera tripod to do any filming - something we 've never been told before . 
In the embassy district in eastern Beijing , Chinese guards are currently wearing flak jackets or stab vests over their uniforms - something that I have n't seen before , and I 've walked past these guards almost every day for the last two years . 
When a colleague of mine mentioned Tiananmen Square during a mobile phone conversation , a Chinese voice interrupted his call for a few seconds .

Blogs and internet pages in China have told the story and even if the exact details remain secret the attack on the students by the PLA as odered by the leadership is no secret . 
When the People 's Army attacked the People the relationship between the government and the governed changed . 
China of 2009 is a direct result of 1989 . 
The battle within the leadership and the need to change direction was percipitated by the events of Tiananmen Square . 
Things change slowly in this world and twenty years is not that long when discussing social change and in China that is a very short period for change . 
The disheartening thing is that this is a secret that everyone knows and the Chinese government insist on maintaining silence about these events . 
History is always written by the victors so it is never the truth . 
In Hong Kong the events are memorialized , so within China there is recognition , just not official recognition . 
It is also important to note that almost every country has had similar events where students or unions or refugees have confronted a sitting government and the actions to address such confrontations have been a show of force . 
China utilized extreme force and that was the nature of the insecurity of the leadership at that time . 
Twenty years prior had been the Cultural Revolution that scared an entire generation with fear and uncertainity . 
One day a statue will be erected in Tiananmen Square for the students , but that will come in time . 
Like the British saying the Anglo-Chinese Wars were about dis-satisfaction of the Chinese with their government when it was really about selling opium in China , the truth sometimes takes awhile to become an accepted part of a national history . 
A repressive and paranoid dictatorship at it 's best . 
No doubt the overseas Chinese will defend the government of a country where they chose not to live\/have never lived .

The student 's protest was moving towards anarchy and chaos and the return to the Cultural Revolution that lasted 10 years -LRB- from 1966 to 1976 -RRB- and that killed millions of people . 
The repression of the students ' rebellion resulted in social and political peace for China and an unprecedented economic growth and development . 
Thanks to social and political peace which permitted rapid economic development in China , hundreds of millions of Chinese no longer live in poverty and no longer suffer from chronic famine .

Yes , the students were killed , but for the sick of China 's stability , for the law and order , if they stay at that night , they should shoulder the consequences . 
As a 9 year old in 1989 , my wishes to these students were eat and leave !! As a 29 year old in 2009 , my wishes to them are same , eat and leave !! At 4:05 pm on 02 Jun 2009 , tclim38 wrote : BBC has been censoring comments here , why Chinese goverment can not do the same ?

Is BBC 's site accessible in China ? 
Do people in China ask themselves why their TVs blacked out so suddenly ?

China today is a lot more open about many events and problems that happen , and people have a little more freedom than they used to have . 
I personally wish that China would just hold it 's hands up and say `` We made a terrible mistake during the events of June 1989 and we are deeply sorry '' . 
Then this will be all over , and people can get back to their lives . 
Constantly hiding the truth time and time again does nothing to help China move forward .

Wen Jiabao , the current Premier , is actually in the infamous picture of the last public appearnce as General Secretary of the late Zhao Zhiyang , who was out of his job -LRB- trying to sound neutral here -RRB- after the events . 
Wen , then the Director of the Central Office of the CCP , was accompanying Zhao on his visit to the Square . 
20 years later one is the Premier and one has died after years of house arrest . 
I also think it will be of great help for establishing the truth if photographic evidence of what happnned that night could be made public . 
There is absolutely no hope in establishing the truth if all that could be heard is the story of two opposing sides , both of which have their own agendas and neither of which have good track records of unbiased , well-rounded and informed claims .

I 'm 27 years old now , and I live in Beijing . 
I have go to the Tiananmen just several day before the disaster with my father . 
But we went back home after no more than 2 hours . 
The protest acturally last a very long time . 
From a small group of student to huge amount of people including lots of people just came for fun . 
I 'm really serious ! 
At last some of them are just come for fun -LRB- such as me , that time I was only 7 years old -RRB- . 
You need to know . 
There are culture revolution before , in culture revolution , people could run to every place of china , and in that time , except some event , you could n't leave your city or villiage , you need to work . 
And all the people have his work assembled by gov , even the children need to go to school . 
But those day , all the school in Beijing stopped classes . 
So I can visit Tianmen for fun . 
And my father is a phd student that time . 
He really with to advice some thought to the gov. However , when we go to there , we found thing is n't right . 
Most of the people 's motion in there are crazy . 
The people who is calm as my father dislike that situation , so we leave . 
And lots of people leave also . 
Only the most crazy people are stay there more than one day . 
More things are , First I should say , I do n't discriminate the people who is n't live in Beijing , because both my parents are born in Shandon province . 
But a small amount people who came from other province stay in Tiananmen is n't peace . 
They burn and break the things to consume their angry ... Actually I did n't think all of them are really extrimely angry , some is only for exiting , that the first time they come to the capital of china , the center of capital , and its also the first time to destroy something which if they do in their own hometown would be punished very strict . 
One thing is ture , which may disappoint most of the anti-china medium . 
The students who come to Tiananmen first is n't anti-communism at all . 
Actually , most of them are communisms as my father . 
They think the direction of the country is n't right , and for a communist , he has the duty to correct the direction of the country . 
-LRB- It sounds a little ridiculous today , is n't it ? -RRB- 
My there are old word in china , that every people need to help the country to pass the bad times . 
And those communists are the one who bravely come out to advice the party the right way . 
So , no student is come to show their angry to the goverment at the begining time , they are going to give the goverment advice . 
However , after the priminister Li Peng refuse to accept the letter of the advice from the students several times . 
The students angry that they hav n't be respect . 
And some of them swear , if the Li Peng did n't come out to receive the letter , then they wo n't go back home . 
After some days protest . 
Li Peng was afraid , and call the army to protect the order . 
But at first , its only come to protect the order . 
The army went through my house , and the soldiers rest at the door of my house , they are laughly talking with each other , and it is definitely their first time come to Beijing , they are friendly to the citizens around them , and they really do n't know what will happened just several days after . 
However , disaster happened when a bunch of `` Football hooligans '' meet a coward priadminister Li Peng . 
And really , before the disaster happen , some soliders who watching the protest has been killed by some bad people , but no solider is killed by students . 
However , who can identificate who is angry student and who is mob ? 
Mob usually run away first when they say the gov is really angry , but the students who did n't know there are soliders have been killed , they do n't think the govment seriousely wish to repressive , they did n't leave and been killed without know why . 
Li Peng is a fool . 
Most of communists have the same thought as I. At 6:51 pm on 02 Jun 2009 , state_clark wrote : The Euro-centric countries can pick on China for what China did on June 4th 1989 . 
However , I wonder how the cities of London , New York , or Paris would do if their students gathered at the largest plaza in their countries eating , sleeping , and carrying out other humanly business for TWO months , in the name of , lets say , anti-globalization or anti-corporate greed ? 
Would these Euro-centric governments allow their national plaza turn into a public cesspool for TWO months ? 
I also wonder when their students were out on the largest plaza in their countries protesting their governments , would any of the governmental officials go meet and listen to those students . 
This is because for weeks before crack down on June 4th , ALL levels of Chinese officials from the City of Beijing to the President of China all came out to meet the students and listen to their voices at the plaza or in their offices which were all broadcast on Chinese national TVs . 
That has never happened or it would ever happen in ANY other Euro-centric countries ! 
In 1989 , the entire police force in the City of Beijing was not even 5 % of the police force in the City of New York . 
So what else could the City of Beijing have done differently to remove the students from their largest national plaza after TWO long months if not using the army at the time when there were no such things as anti-riot police or national guards like we have in the U. S ? 
While the Euro-centric countries can point fingers at China for what China did on June 4th 1989 , if the same thing happened in their countries , they would do the exactly same as the Chinese government did on June 4th . 
The only difference might be that the Euro-centric countries would NEVER allow their students to camp out on their national plaza for more than a couple of days , let alone TWO long months . 
About those student leaders , how could they ask others to hunger strike while themselves drink and feast ? 
And mostly , how could they ask other students to `` shed blood '' or `` sacrifice lives for democracy '' while themselves were already in contact with foreign agencies planning their own escape routes so that theyd not die for their causes and live in the U.S or Europe as that 's where most of them ended up days after June 4th 1989 ? 
20 years later , as if it never happened ... because it was only significant to fewer than handful of Chinese when you look at the entire population of China and if you have just a little cultural knowledge about China . 
However , it is MOST significant for Euro-centric countries that want to utilize it for material means on contract negotiating tables in recent years and some years to come . 
One day on Michigan Ave in Chicago , I saw a car with bumper sticker says `` Be nice to us , or we will bring democracy to your country '' Nobody here , this site is blocked and who cares anyway . 
Nothing happened in Tiananmen Sq. , I 've watched all the news reports and there is no proof of it , no pictures or vids of the lie .

Do you always look other languages TV programs ?

Before that time we are work so hard to feed our stomach .

Everyday they have long hours about the protest , most are exagerated , you can sense a sort of excitement in their reports . 
That made me believe what the government said about foreign influence . 
They did exist although those journalists like James would not admit at that time . 
I still remember those caotic periods , students from all over the country traveling to Beijing -LRB- they can travel free with their student ID at that time , the whole country was disfunctional . 
Having experienced culture revolution , my parents were extremely worried as they thought another culture revolution were going to happen . 
For those who studied Chinese histtory during culture revolution , they should know that started exactly the same with students went on protesting , parading , camping in Tiananmen square . 
Whatever happened , Chinese government should not use the force at that level , however , the students leaders , the foreign journalists and Zhao ZiYang all should bear responsibilities .

Many violent rioters are hooligans and yobs , were not students . 
There were some students were really extreme and aggressive . 
End of the day , we realize that burn down Tiananmen and change the government would not make China better .

Look back now , I have been traveling in many democratic western countries , I am glad that was in control , otherwise , China would be poorest country in the world . 
For the past thousand years , Censorship is a traditional way to have political power in control , not only with communist party . 
It is a bit annoying , but that 's way it is . 
It is also the reason to hold 1.3 billion population together , UK and other western countries would never have clue how the power rules in China . 
I would like to question why the Nanking Massacre in 1937 War II , 300,000 Chinese casualties , by the Imperial Japanese Army committed atrocities such as rape , looting , arson and the execution of prisoners of war and civilians rising to the level of war crimes has never raised any issue by BBC and Western media , why is Tiananmen Square in 1989 incident with Chinese domestic matter would raise such issue ?

One of the previous posters made a good point . 
Lets face it , no one cares about the chinese except the chinese themselves . 
Everyone else has an alterior motive be it selling newspapers , taking the moral highground or maintaining a hegemon . 
The events in 89 were caused by a misguided belief that western style democracy and western interventon would bring about an improved lifestyle of wealth and prosperity . 
A family member of mine who was apart of the movement even admits this and has said many a time that they were misguided youths at the time . 
As with any movement there are also hardcore instigators who will always refuse to admit they were wrong , and these are the ones that are glorified in the west but shunned in China . 
89 as with any event in history , contributed to the outcome . 
The outcome is that it wasnt the west that helped China succeed today , but the chinese themselves .

As said on James Mile 's article : `` Reports of the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square and their violent end have had a huge impact on how the outside world sees China . '' 
What the outside world needs to understand is that `` democracy '' is n't always the best option for 1.3 billion people at a point in time . 
Pressure from without will not change what the people want , it needs to come from within , and surely when the society advances to the point where it can support democracy , it will happen regardless of government control . 
You can cite Tiananmen all you want as an example of government suppression , but if the Chinese people really want democracy , it ca n't be suppressed . 
So with the Economic crisis on hold , H1N1 under control , and not much actual China news , is it time to raise negative feelings against China again ?

This kind of crude generalisation is no better than those which assume the Chinese people to be a homogeneous mass with exactly the same thoughts and feelings and aspirations . 
Sympathy is a basic human impulse , one which crosses boundaries of race and nationality . 
Even though it is difficult to know exactly what happened in Tiananmen Sq , I have no ` alterior motive ' for feeling upset that military force was used to end the life of ANY peaceful protestor -- whether one or many -- anywhere in the world .

I did see some young people got hurt and were put on three wheel carts , evidently being rushed to the hospitals . 
I also saw mob climbed up to a tank and set it on fire . 
Do n't remember if the soldiers in the tank got killed or not . 
There were many many foreign media , equipped with advanced communication gears , working so hard trying to take the advantage of the situation . 
They thought they got the best opportunity to defeat China using Chinese . 
They all seem worried the event would n't be big enough to topple the government ... That is the core problem . 
The naive students saw the foreign media and believed they got help and refused to back down . 
Because of the fanning flame by foreigners , I do n't think the government made a mistake by sending in the troops . 
Riot police with water cannons simply would n't have done it . 
I agree wholeheartedly China needs to gradually improve itself on governing by ` rule of law ' , reducing corruption , etc. . 
But , is that the right way to achieve it ?

That is your own feeling , Sir , please to understand here , most of Chinese are sad for students who lost lives , but they pleased the situation had been controlled ! 
and those yobs , mobs , roitors whom would understand freedom and democracy equal to lawlessness , had been brought into justice . 
I read every comments here -LRB- above -RRB- , no one said they think today China 's achievement is benefit from the killing . 
people with extremely anti chinese view may would have commenting in this logic . 
I would say the benefit is that China had been saved from total social unrest and political disaster . 
peaceful protest is allowed in wherever around the world , but violent and destructive behaviors would meet with tough solution not only in China . 
At the time , the Chinese government had neither crowd control experience nor equipment like water canon and tear gas .

Most people here may have never seen the video of this `` tankman '' . 
Actually in the video , the defiant man challenged the tanks by standing still . 
When the tanks want to move around him , he move too to stop them . 
Later he threw a burning bottle full of gasoline to the tank , and the tank caught fire immediately . 
Soldiers then hurried out of the tank in fear of burning to death . 
That 's the story told be the original video tape . 
Unfortunately it was seldom broadcasted because the material is not suitable for western media to tell the audience the story they want to tell . 
But a static picture , believe it or not , give media more space to fabricate stories .

This argument we 're having here only proves that China is feared to become a superpower . 
China does n't have a democracy . 
Democracy is for westerners who inherited humanism and individualism thoughts emerged around the Renaissance . 
China does n't need a democracy . 
Democracy is for countries that , being either too strong or too weak , do n't have a catch-up job to do . 
But in these statements `` democracy '' meant US-style democracy , in which , voting is the only solution to problems , and not everyone has the money to hold nation-wide elections . 
Oh wait a minute , has the US ever voted on whether to attack Iraq outside the congress ? 
Like they voted for a president who is certainly for or against abortion ? 
This is after all 20 years ago . 
That 's 1\/3 of this country 's life . 
What was the US like when it was 60 years ago ? 
What was the UK like ? 
It is n't fair to compare the current China to the current US . 
Human Rights - you might mean it , your president does n't . 
It is nice to read these ideas .

For example I could not visit the BBC website , but the UK national papers ' websites : the Indy , Guardian , Times , Telegraph etc. . .

In fact I sat in a Beijing hostel reading the contents of an allegedly censored World Bank report on China 's air and water standards without anyone taking the slightest interest . 
Similarly with the people I met ; those who did n't seem to care much about politics had very little realisation of the international criticisms of China , on the other hand those who wanted to know were very well informed . 
There 's a remarkable place in Beijing called Factory 798 , it 's a commune of artists and radicals -LRB- anyone going to Beijing should take a day to wander through the galleries and studios -RRB- , many of the residents are the remnant of ' 89 . 
While the government undoubtedly keeps an eye on them their , often aggressive , anti-government art and sentiment is allowed to flourish . 
Censorship in any form should be done away with , however what surprised me in China was , in the East coast cities , how symbolic it had become . 
My guess -LRB- and it is just that -RRB- is the situation outside of the East Coast cities -LRB- which are frequented by Westerners -RRB- is far worse . 
As computer prices drop and interned access becomes more widespread it will be fascinating to see how the CCP reacts . 
What I would say is that the CCP seemed to have learned the lessons of East Germany and realized that in a global economy they ca n't build walls , and so Nike et al all do a roaring trade . 
It is possible they will have to acquiesce to the global information network that is the internet in a similar fashion . 
Are you living in China ? 
If yes , you have just told us that you have access to sensitive pieces of information that I do n't here in Hong Kong . 
If what you said is true , i.e. you have watched the video showing the ` tankman ' threw some ` burning bottle full of gasoline to the tank ' , then you have corrected my -LRB- but I think I am not alone -RRB- biased view that mainland China have banned all discussion and materials concerning June 4 1989 . 
Your post started out sensible but degenerated rapidly into unrestrained fantasy . 
`` And the foreign powers certainly would have sent in the occupying troops -LRB- using the pretext of protecting their own citizens ... sound familiar ? -RRB- '' 
Do you mean like during the boxer rebellion ? 
Or like the Japanese occupation ? 
Do you still believe references to such distant history are relevant to today 's world ? 
Perhaps in the mind of the CCP propaganda machine - a useful rallying cry for nationalism after all . 
In any case , what power or coalition of powers would have had the manpower or remotest wish to have done as you suggest ? 
You are on a different planet my friend .

2009-06-02,"Firms are hard at work on a vaccine The number of swine flu cases in the UK has climbed to more than 330 . 
The Health Protection Agency recorded more than 60 new cases alone on Tuesday , and although nobody has yet died from the virus , experts are warning against any complacency . 
And the hard work is only just beginning for scientists developing a vaccine . 
At the west London office of the drug giant GSK , there is a special unit for global planning on flu pandemic vaccines . 
A special sample of the swine flu or H1N1 virus has arrived at GSK in the past week , allowing scientists to begin a detailed analysis . 
The UK medical director , Dr Pim Kon , told me the six-month process has many uncertainties . 
Although the company has agreed to provide 60m doses of a vaccine , it is not yet known how many people that will cover . 
Dr Kon said : `` That is still to be determined , as it is based on how the production goes . 
The vaccine will be based on certain parts of the virus , so they 'll need to see whether those parts change `` The scientists will also be keeping a very close eye on whether the virus mutates . 
`` The vaccine will be based on certain parts of the virus , so they 'll need to see whether those parts change . '' 
The detailed scientific work is being done at GSK 's plant in Belgium , while executives in London negotiate global contracts . 
Health experts are monitoring H1N1 cases in countries like Brazil , where winter and normal `` seasonal '' flu is just beginning . 
Professor Ab Osterhaus , who is based in Rotterdam , has studied flu viruses for half of his 30-year career , and predicts various tensions in the months ahead . 
He said : `` If you start to produce the pandemic flu vaccine , it will go at the cost of the seasonal flu vaccine . 
`` Seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people around the world every year - so we still have a responsibility there as well . 
If we have a pandemic , there 'll be a problem with equitable distribution of these protective measures `` The production capacity is limited , and vaccines have to be produced within six months . 
`` There is likely to be competition between countries . 
`` The richer countries have ordered pre-pandemic vaccine . 
That is not the case for countries that do n't have so many resources . 
`` So if we have a pandemic , there 'll be a problem with equitable distribution of these protective measures . 
`` It 's a major issue for the World Health Organisation to consider . '' 
The Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , has warned that H1N1 may be spreading in the community - despite efforts to contain it among known travellers and their contacts . 
Previous pandemics have started in a mild fashion , but developed in waves . 
You wait 20 years for a proper scare to come along - and when one does , people accuse you of crying wolf And although the figures do not now lead news bulletins , the number of swine flu cases continues to rise each day . 
After the initial flurry of coverage , questions were raised about whether the threat posed by H1N1 had been over-hyped . 
That is firmly denied by the health editor of the Independent newspaper , Jeremy Laurance , who wrote a strident front-page piece a month ago . 
He told me : `` People say there are only two kinds of medical story - the miracle cure and the deadly scare . 
`` You wait 20 years for a proper scare to come along - and when one does , people accuse you of crying wolf . 
`` I felt there was a real need to answer that charge - and that 's why I wrote the piece I did . 
`` This is a wholly new virus that we have n't seen before . 
`` And it 's estimated a third of the world 's population wo n't have immunity to it . 
`` That 's why we need to take it seriously . '' 
And in the meantime , the NHS is learning lessons . 
A leading light in the BMA doctors ' union , Dr Jonathan Fielden , works in intensive care at a busy hospital in the Home Counties . 
Dr Fielden said : `` We had a case of concern which led us to ensure we had special masks which were properly fitted . 
`` They give a higher level of protection than the masks we use in theater . 
`` So far , it 's been a useful test of our procedures , in circumstances where the flu has n't been severe at this stage . 
`` Our concern , as we come to the normal flu season in the winter , is that many of our resources are already under pressure . 
`` Although there 's been an increase in intensive care beds , we still have some of the lowest numbers in Europe per head of population . 
`` Those beds are often under great stress in normal circumstances - and in these circumstances , there will be pressure throughout the system . ''

2009-06-03,"RIYADH , June 3 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Saudi Arabia has confirmed its first case of the H1N1 flu virus in a Filipina nurse , the kingdom 's health minister said on Wednesday . 
The woman arrived on Friday on board a Gulf Air flight from the Philippines and showed first symptoms on Monday , Abdullah al-Rabeeah told Saudi news channel al-Ekhbariya , adding that she was being held in quarantine in a hospital in the capital Riyadh . 
`` She was n't showing any symptoms then when she came back ... She started showing some symptoms on Monday , '' he said . 
`` Preliminary tests turned positive last night , '' he said , adding that more tests had confirmed the results on Wednesday . 
Saudi authorities are tracking down people who had contact with her on the flight and in the hospital , he said . 
Gulf Air flights usually operate through their Manama hub in Bahrain . 
Saudi Arabia 's neighbor Kuwait said on May 24 that 18 U.S. soldiers had H1N1 flu in the first cases to hit the world 's largest oil exporting region . 
Kuwait is a logistics base for the U.S. army for their Iraq operations .

2009-06-03,"ATLANTA | Wed Jun 3 , 2009 12:22 pm EDT ATLANTA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Global airlines , still reeling from the recent flu-virus scare , have stepped up efforts to protect passengers from health risks on international flights . 
In Asia , carriers spooked by the memory of SARS have stepped up cabin cleaning , installed state-of-the-art air filters and allowed in-flight staff to wear face masks . 
For example , Cathay Pacific now replaces used pillows , blankets , headset covers and headrest covers , spokeswoman Carolyn Leung said . 
China Southern Airlines has been disinfecting the cabins of all aircraft . 
China Eastern Airlines flight attendants are required to wear disposable facial masks , gloves and hats and even disposable overcoats during flights to select destinations . 
Mexicana Airlines uses high-efficiency filters that can trap small particles that would normally recirculate back into the air , spokesman Adolfo Crespo said . 
The H1N1 flu virus has been confirmed in 20,000 people in 68 countries , killing at least 126 , according to the World Health Organization . 
Although it appears mild , experts worry that the disease , which formerly was called `` swine flu , '' could change into a more dangerous form . 
In the wake of the spread , some countries have intensified health precautions . 
Singapore saw its first case of the H1N1 flu in late May , after a native student flew from New York to the city-state on a Singapore Airlines flight . 
Singapore has been thermal-screening everyone coming into the country . 
The method , which identifies travelers with a fever , did not help authorities spot the sick student , as she had not yet developed a fever . 
The government quarantined the passenger and about 60 other people on the same flight who were sitting within three rows . 
`` This wo n't be the last case in Singapore unless we could stop people from traveling , '' Singapore 's Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said . 
Singapore Airlines Ltd , the world 's biggest by market value , is giving passengers traveling to the United States health kits that include a thermometer , masks and antiseptic towels . 
Its cabin and flight crews are getting mandatory temperature checks before flights . 
In contrast to the measures taken by Asian airlines , U.S. carriers have simply continued safety standards already in place , relying on the advice of authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 
Atlanta-based CDC has not recommended that airline crews wear face masks or disposable overcoats . 
`` The issue with H1N1 and airlines is an issue of translocation , not necessarily on-board transmission , '' Shelly Sikes Diaz , a CDC spokeswoman , said in an email . 
She added that people were no more likely to catch the flu on a two-hour plane flight than they were sitting next to someone for a two-hour movie . 
`` Therefore , at this time , recommended on-board infection control measures would be similar to community infection control measures '' such as frequent hand-washing , Diaz added . 
David Castelveter , a spokesman with the Air Transport Association trade group , said U.S. airlines for the most part have made no major changes in the wake of swine flu , but continued standing practices that include looking for passengers with symptoms of flu , measles or other infections . 
He added that in-flight air filters ensure that aircraft are sanitized . 
`` We take our guidance from the professionals -LRB- such as the CDC -RRB- who tell us the precautions that are needed to prevent the spread , '' Castelveter said . 
`` We 're not taking the type of precautions that are unnecessary . '' 
While Castelveter said media coverage of the flu has boosted awareness of airline safety procedures , Mexicana 's Crespo stressed that carriers still have work to do to change public perceptions that air quality on planes is bad . 
`` Inside , our aircraft is cleaner than in a hospital , '' Crespo said . 
Julian Tang , a consultant for the microbiology division at National University Hospital in Singapore , also said hygiene practices such as covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing in confined areas may be the best way to limit infection . 
He said safety measures such as costly air filters may be of limited use for carriers . 
`` This is because most of the transmission between passengers probably mostly occurs just after the sneeze\/cough in the immediate vicinity of the passenger rather than after it flows through the ventilation\/circulation system and back out again , '' he said .

2009-06-04,"When President Barack Obama unveiled his plans for Afghanistan and Pakistan in March , he promised to involve other countries with a stake in the region , including the Central Asian states , the Gulf nations and Iran ; Russia , India and China . 
But a major sticking point in enlisting regional support has been distrust over the United States ' long-term intentions for Afghanistan . 
Washington has never been able to shake off suspicions that it is using its battle against the Taliban and al Qaeda to establish a permanent military presence in the region . 
In that context , Obama 's statement during his speech in Cairo that the United States is not seeking to set up permanent military bases in Afghanistan is rather interesting : `` Make no mistake : we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan . 
We seek no military bases there . 
It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women . 
It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict . 
We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can . 
But that is not yet the case . '' 
It will be worth watching to see whether the Obama administration is able to build on this to win more regional support for its policies in Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
But at the same time , it has to avoid feeding Pakistani fears that the United States might one day abruptly leave the region , just as it did when the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 .

2009-06-06,"Policemen stop a mother who is trying to access the area of a fire at a daycare center in Hermosillo , in the Mexican state of Sonora June 5 , 2009 . 
MEXICO CITY | Sat Jun 6 , 2009 7:05 pm EDT MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The death toll from a fire at a day-care center in northern Mexico rose to 35 children with at least 40 more hospitalized , many with life-threatening burns , Mexican authorities said on Saturday . 
Mexican President Felipe Calderon said he has ordered an investigation into Friday 's fire at the ABC day-care center in the northern city of Hermosillo to find who is to blame . 
As flames blocked the center 's doorway , employees and neighbors used cars to punch holes through a wall and stumbled over unconscious infants and toddlers as they tried to rescue them , witnesses said . 
Smoke inhalation killed many children before rescuers could reach them , with the victims ranging in age from a few months old to about 3 years old , authorities said . 
It was unclear where or how the fire started , although it may have broken out in a nearby warehouse or a tire workshop , the government said . 
`` According to what our people saw , there was an explosion followed immediately by flames , '' Daniel Karam , head of the Mexican agency responsible for health care and social security , said at a news conference in Hermosillo . 
The city of about 700,000 people is located about 170 miles south of the border with the U.S. state of Arizona . 
Calderon said he was rushing medical assistance to overwhelmed medical staff in Hermosillo , including air ambulances and specialists in reconstructive surgery . 
`` I have ordered the attorney general , along with local authorities ... to investigate as soon as possible to find out exactly what happened and identify whoever may be responsible , '' Calderon said in a speech during an event in the state of Quintana Roo . 
More than 140 children were in the ABC day-care center when the fire broke out , Karam told reporters . 
Karam said the center had passed its last government inspection in May . 
The previous death toll given by the government was 31 children , but four more died in the hospital overnight . 
In addition , at least 40 more children remained hospitalized , authorities said . 
About 20 were in `` extremely grave '' condition , some with burns covering more than 70 percent of their bodies , the government said . 
Six adults also were hospitalized in less serious condition following the fire , authorities said . 
At a government auditorium , parents waited silently for their children 's bodies to be turned over to them . 
At least one child was being flown to the Shriners children 's hospital in Sacramento , California , which specializes in burns and has been consulting with Mexican doctors , the hospital said . 
`` Our burn team here has been working all night with the medical professionals in Mexico to triage these patients , on the phone , '' Shriners hospital spokeswoman Catherine Curran told Reuters .

2009-06-07,"ACAPULCO , Mexico | Sun Jun 7 , 2009 6:39 pm EDT ACAPULCO , Mexico -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Eighteen people were killed in a shootout between drug gangs and soldiers in the Mexican beach resort of Acapulco , the army said on Sunday . 
The gun battle , near tourist hotels in the Pacific Ocean resort , was a further blow to Mexico 's tourism industry , already reeling from cancellations by foreigners scared away by the swine flu epidemic . 
Gunmen battled troops from a cartel safe house , throwing hand grenades at soldiers who had surrounded them and spraying gunfire into military vehicles and nearby homes . 
The shooting began late on Saturday and went on until after midnight . 
`` There were grenade and rocket explosions , and weapons like AK-47s , '' said an employee of a neighboring hotel . 
`` The fight lasted almost two hours . '' 
Sixteen suspected members of the Beltran Leyva drug gang were killed as well as two soldiers , including a captain . 
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has staked his presidency on crushing drug gangs whose turf wars have killed about 2,300 people this year . 
Some 45,000 troops and federal police have been deployed across the country . 
While the clash was several miles away from the main area where foreign tourists stay in high-rise hotels , a resurgence of violence in Acapulco is bad news for the tourism industry . 
Rival drug gangs fought over territory in Acapulco , home to around a million people , several years ago , but the resort has been relatively free of drug violence in recent years . 
Tourism , a key industry for Mexico , took a hit in late April and early May when the H1N1 flu virus spread through Mexico and scared off travelers . 
Violence associated with drugs across Mexico has damaged investor sentiment and the U.S. government is concerned about instability in Mexico , an ally and big oil supplier . 
President Barack Obama visited Mexico City in April , praised Calderon for tackling the drug gangs and offered more U.S. help in the war . 
Drug violence has also hurt Mexican beach resorts , like Cancun and Ixtapa . 
The Beltran Leyva gang , rivals of the powerful Sinaloa cartel , is believed to dominate the drug trade around Acapulco , a popular destination for vacationing U.S. college students . 
Also on Sunday , the attorney general 's office said police arrested Olga Cristina Lerma , a financial operative in the Sinaloa cartel , which is based in northwest Mexico . 
Lerma is responsible for bringing $ 22 million from drug sales from the United States into Mexico and will be extradited , the attorney general 's office said in a statement .

2009-06-07,"KUALA LUMPUR | Sun Jun 7 , 2009 10:57 am EDT KUALA LUMPUR -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Demand for air travel could decline further despite signs of a more stable global economy , and prospects of a recovery this year look slim , industry executives said at a meeting of the world 's airlines on Sunday . 
Cargo demand may have stabilized , but a pick-up is unlikely until demand recovers in the United States , said the CEO of Korean Air , the world 's top air cargo carrier . 
`` I think we have hit the bottom , '' Cho Yang Ho told Reuters . 
European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it was sticking to its 2009 sales target of 300 gross orders but that it would be more difficult to accomplish . 
`` It is more of a stretch now , '' Airbus Commercial Director John Leahy told Reuters . 
`` We see the market improving , and we have negotiations for orders ongoing . '' 
International Lease Finance Corp -LRB- ILFC -RRB- , the world 's largest plane-leasing company , said it was negotiating for more planes with Airbus and Boeing Co , but `` at the right price . '' 
The annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association began on a somber note , with last week 's still unexplained crash of an Airbus A330-200 adding to the woes of an industry hurt by the financial crisis and volatile oil prices . 
But several airline executives were quick to defend the plane . 
`` It 's a safe plane , it 's a good plane , '' said Chew Choon Seng , the chief executive of Singapore Airlines , which has 16 A330-200s on order . 
`` We should not jump to conclusions . '' 
All 228 people on board the Air France plane were killed when it crashed in the Atlantic Ocean , the world 's worst air disaster since 2001 . 
Airline chiefs saw other concerns ahead , from rising unemployment to a surplus of plane capacity that could hurt profitability . 
`` I think it 's probably going to get worse , '' Rob Fyfe , chief executive of Air New Zealand , told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting . 
The bearish comments contrast with the more positive outlook from some global policymakers and economists about a global recovery in the wake of recent data such as the slowing pace of U.S. job losses . 
Airlines have cut capacity and jobs in response to a slide in profits , and some have delayed or canceled orders for new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus . 
The chairman and founder of India 's Jet Airways said the airline may defer its orders for 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners because of the economic crisis . 
NareshGoyal told Reuters that no decision had been taken , but that it would depend on economic conditions . 
But Deutsche Lufthansa 's Chief Executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber said his airline , which has about $ 15.8 billion in orders for new aircraft , had no plans to delay or cancel any of them , although it was difficult to predict the outlook for the industry . 
`` We have very little visibility , '' he said . 
More recently , outbreaks of the new H1N1 swine flu virus have added to the gloomy prospects for global air travel and tourism . 
According to the World Health Organization , the new influenza strain has been found in 64 countries , and remains most prevalent in North America . 
WHO labs have confirmed nearly 19,000 infections .

2009-06-08,"\* Obama , lawmakers want lots of extras in war funding bill \* U.S. Congress bogged down on provisions on IMF , photos WASHINGTON , June 8 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A $ 100 billion bill to fund U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is rapidly accumulating extra items such as money for military aircraft the Pentagon does n't want and possibly a scheme to jump-start sagging auto sales . 
The cars and planes are not directly linked to the U.S. war effort . 
But they are typical of Congress ' penchant for loading bills with unrelated spending in hopes the funds will sail through on the strength of the main legislation . 
President Barack Obama originally sought $ 83.4 billion for the two wars and more foreign aid for countries like Pakistan . 
But then he too sought more -- $ 4 billion extra to combat H1N1 swine flu and $ 5 billion to back credit lines to the International Monetary Fund , which is trying to help developing countries weather the global economic downturn . 
The unrelated provisions have slowed the bill down , especially for the IMF because Republicans have argued the extra items should be vetted through the normal congressional process rather than jammed into an emergency spending bill . 
Fights have also erupted about add-ons for the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba and an attempt to bar the release of photos of detainee abuse . 
While Republicans do not have the votes to block the bill , they have said they will oppose it and that forces Democrats to ensure most of their members back it . 
`` This supplemental was supposed to be about providing funding for our troops , '' one House Republican aide said . 
Instead , it has become a mish-mashed , taxpayer funded ` Christmas tree ' bill that will propagate bad policies and unnecessary spending . '' 
Some 51 anti-war House Democrats had opposed the bill but now are under pressure to switch to give Obama a victory . 
But a House Democratic leadership aide said Republicans will have to answer to constituents for opposing a war funding bill . 
The House and Senate are working out differences between the two versions of the war funding bill they each approved last month and hope to pass a final , single version this week . 
Congress was on the verge of giving Pakistan roughly $ 1 billion in the bill , but Obama last week sought another $ 200 million for Islamabad as it fights Taliban militants crossing its border from Afghanistan . 
And lawmakers are also considering adding money for a plan to spur domestic car sales by offering up to $ 4,500 in vouchers for buyers to trade in their less fuel-efficient vehicles for ones that get better mileage , known as `` cash for clunkers '' . 
The White House declined to directly address adding in extra provisions , but said officials continue to work with lawmakers `` about the core priorities in the legislation and hope that it can get to the president soon . '' 
When the House and Senate originally approved their separate versions of the war bill , the White House praised lawmakers for not inserting their own pet projects in the legislation -- though some pet priorities were included . 
Democratic Representative John Murtha , who heads the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , managed to get $ 3.1 billion for eight C-17 and 11 C-130 military transport planes included . 
However , that has been pared back by four C-130s . 
The Pentagon did not request the aircraft but lawmakers want them to preserve jobs in their home states and Murtha disputes the military 's contention that they are not needed . 
A senior Democratic House aide said the requests for flu and Pakistan money were appropriate to include in the bill because they were emergency needs Obama cited . 
The aide also noted that Republicans in the past backed items like the IMF funds . 
`` This is a dangerous game Republicans are playing by jeopardizing the well-being of our soldiers to score political points , '' the aide said . 
`` The supplemental will be passed , but they will have to answer for their actions if they oppose it . ''

2009-06-09,"Are pig pens flu bug incubators ? 
The spread of so-called swine flu , which has caused over 120 deaths globally , has sent public health officials into overdrive . 
Industrial farms are said to be a `` perfect incubating system '' As thousands fell ill in rural Mexico , those living near the outbreak raised suspicions about large industrial pig farms despite the owners ' saying their herds were clean and workers were healthy . 
Concerns over the border in the US have also centred on the intensive methods which have transformed pig farming in the past 20 years , Julian O'Halloran reports . 
Animal welfare campaigners may see the way pigs are crammed into their pens in industrial farms as cruel , but to some public health experts these pens are also incubators for viruses . 
This was the warning in a report published last year by American NGO , the Pew Charitable Trust , which funded a commission to study the possible spread of viruses and pathogens . 
The conclusion of the study , which took two-and-a-half-years to produce , was clear : `` The continued cycling of viruses and other animal pathogens in large herds or flocks increases opportunities for the generation of novel viruses through mutation ... that could result in more efficient human-to-human transmission . '' 
The commission 's executive director , Bob Martin , told BBC File on 4 the warning was prophetic , coming a year before this outbreak of flu in Mexico in March . 
`` The commission was very concerned regarding the concentration of swine . 
Swine are incredible incubators for viruses - they 're susceptible to swine flu , avian flu and human flu . '' 
He added : `` They can pass it back to you , the human worker and then back to the pig . 
They generate the novel virus , as it 's called . '' 
Mr Martin said the commission had based its report on research by the Iowa School of Public Health , where one of its commissioners was dean of the school . 
`` They came and addressed what a perfect incubating system a concentrated animal feeding operation or an industrial farm is for breeding novel flu viruses . '' 
He said the virology experts stated these farms could amplify the spread of flu and add to the problem in another way - by possibly increasing the risk that the virus will also infect humans . 
`` Many of the industrial farm operation workers are lower-income scale in the US - they do n't have access to immediate health care or screening and they would be a bridging population to bring the virus from the industrial farm to the broader population . '' 
However the farming industry believes its methods do not increase the risk of breeding novel flu viruses . 
Listen to File on 4 , BBC Radio 4 2000 BST , Tuesday 9 June 2009 , repeated 1700 , Sunday 14 June 2009 . 
Dr Liz Wagstrom , scientific expert with the US National Pork Council , insisted that a range of precautions are in place on US farms . 
`` There are all sorts of influenza viruses , pigs are one of them , birds are one of them , humans are one of them and there is a chance for these recombination events can happen in all three species so that 's why we have worked very closely with public health agencies to try to develop a surveillance and response plan to identify emerging viruses and respond to them , '' she said . 
The industry also rejects the term swine flu after meat sales fell following the outbreak of the new flu . 
And she said that America 's top public health officials now call the virus H1N1 . 
`` We worked closely with scientists and others to question whether this was an appropriate name and people within the scientific bodies came to the conclusion that even though there were pieces and parts of this virus that were consistent with viruses seen in swine , because it was not number one found in pigs and contact with pigs was not associated with infection , it was better renamed , '' she added . 
However , Dr David Morens , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases near Washington DC , is not convinced . 
`` It 's a swine virus - a virus that 's descended from two different pig viruses that have been in pigs for a number of years . '' 
He told File on 4 : `` If you had asked most virologists last year most would have said it was unlikely that a virus circulating in pigs could jump into humans and cause a pandemic . 
`` And yet that seems what we 're observing now ... it certainly is spreading in the direction of being called a pandemic . '' 
He added : `` Over the coming months , many public health officials in the world will be discussing these things and undoubtedly more research will need to be done and ask the question what can be done to limit the chance that something like this will happen again .

2009-06-09,"Iata members were in sombre mood at their annual meeting The global economic downturn , the spread of H1N1 and volatile oil prices make for an unpleasant mix that has hit the airline industry more than most . 
These themes were clearly occupying the minds of many of the world 's airline chiefs , more than 200 of whom gathered at the International Air Transport Association 's annual meeting in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , this week . 
The atmosphere at the meeting was subdued , with many worried brows . 
Massive losses in the industry made even previously friendly chief executives , such as newly-installed Iata chairman Tony Tyler of Cathay Pacific , reluctant to speak to the journalists . 
Iata is projecting a $ 9bn annual loss for the commercial airline industry this year and as the global airline body , it should know . 
It counts 230 airlines as members . 
Giovanni Bisignani , Iata 's director general , reckons the industry is in survival mode . 
`` I am a realist and I do n't see facts to support optimism , '' he says . 
`` Whether this crisis is long or short , the world is changing . 
Travel budgets have been slashed and consumers will need to reduce their debt . 
It will not be business as usual in the post-crisis world . 
`` Governments , partners and airlines must use this crisis as an opportunity to build a stronger industry . 
That means resizing and reshaping . '' 
The resizing is already taking place . 
From Singapore Airlines to Qantas , planes have been grounded and carriers are reducing capacity . 
It will not be business as usual in the post-crisis world The ones in the Asia Pacific stand to lose the most - $ 3.3 bn according to Iata 's projections - so scaling back is imperative . 
However , the elusive chief executive of the region 's largest airline , Singapore Airlines , was keeping a brave face . 
Chew Choon Seng often eschews one-on-one interviews , but he was happy to talk to us on the sidelines of the meeting 's first cocktail reception about prospects for the future . 
`` Oil prices are still quite high in historical terms . 
The recession has affected our business globally . 
`` And on top of it , the H1N1 flu epidemic has dampened demand more in Asia , than perhaps in America or Europe , '' he says . 
`` We do not know when the global economy will turn around , but it will in due course , and when it comes around , demand will be there , there will be a revival and the challenge for all of us in the industry is to position ourselves in the interim until we get there . '' 
Airlines are cutting back in other ways . 
First-class travel may be on its way out if Alan Joyce , the newly installed chief executive of Qantas Airways is to be believed . 
The Irishman took the helm of the Australian airline last November , when his predecessor , Geoff Dixon , retired . 
Since he took over , more than 1,000 jobs have been axed , 10 planes have been grounded and the airline has delayed the deliveries of 12 Boeing 737s and four Airbus A380s by up to a year . 
`` What we 've done is said , how do we cope with the current environment where we 've seen 20 to 30 percent drop in premium traffic ? 
On some routes , we 've seen the first-class cabins particularly empty , '' says Mr Joyce . 
`` So the easiest thing to do in the short term is what we call a cosmetic configuration , which is not selling those seats as first class but selling them as business class , so effectively we have more seats on sale on the aircraft . 
We have introduced that on a number of routes . '' 
These worries over the global slowdown , though , did not dictate the entire agenda . 
Iata also outlined plans for the industry to become carbon neutral by 2020 . 
At the meeting , airline bosses committed to a global cap on emissions by 2020 . 
After that date , aviation 's emissions will not grow even as demand increases , according to Mr Bisignani . 
Airlines currently account for 2 % of global emissions and that figure continues to grow . 
The environment is only the last in a long list of concerns that continue to dog the industry , which may , more than most , encounter turbulence while riding out the storm .

2009-06-09,"LONDON | Tue Jun 9 , 2009 9:52 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters Life ! -RRB- 
- More than two thousand students painted themselves blue and slipped into white costumes to top the world record for the largest number of people dressed up as smurfs , a Guinness World Records adjudicator said Tuesday . 
The students of Swansea University in Wales beat the previous record of 1,253 people set last year in Ireland by recruiting 2,510 people willing to dress up as the characters created by a Belgian cartoonist 51 years ago . 
`` It may sound like a joke , but students are very serious about smashing the World Record for the most people dressed as smurfs '' the Guinness World Record organization wrote in a statement before the attempt . 
The event was partially sponsored by a fancy dress costume seller and strict controls were in place to check that every `` smurf '' was completely blue . 
`` There were five adjudicators checking every single smurf and if patches of skin were showing the smurf did n't count , '' said James Houston , president of the Swansea University Student Union and organizer of the event . 
He added that the number would have been even higher if some people had not been allergic to the face paint . 
`` It was the weirdest experience of my life , being in the middle of a crowd of what looked like cloned smurfs , '' said Houston , who also donned a smurf outfit -- consisting of a white hat , and a one-piece smurf-suit . 
The Student 's Union said that the success was just the beginning of a whole series of similar dress-up records which they hope to smash .

2009-06-09,"GENEVA | Tue Jun 9 , 2009 1:54 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- is on the verge of declaring the first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years , but wants to ensure countries are well prepared to prevent a panic , its top flu expert said on Tuesday . 
Keiji Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director-general , voiced concern at the sustained spread of the new H1N1 strain -- including more than 1,000 cases in Australia -- following major outbreaks in North America , where it emerged in April . 
Confirmed community spread in a second region beyond North America would trigger moving to phase 6 -- signifying a full-blown pandemic -- from the current phase 5 on the WHO 's 6-level pandemic alert scale . 
`` The situation has really evolved a lot over the past several days . 
We are getting really very close to knowing that we are in a pandemic situation , or I think , declaring that we are in a pandemic situation , '' Fukuda told a teleconference . 
Fukuda said a move to phase 6 would reflect the geographic spread of the new disease . 
`` It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased or that people are getting seriously sick at higher numbers or higher rates than they are right now , '' he said . 
A decision to declare a pandemic involved more than simply making an announcement , he said . 
The United Nations agency had to ensure that countries were able to deal with the new situation and also handle any public reaction . 
`` One of the critical issues is that we do not want people to ` over-panic ' if they hear that we are in a pandemic situation . 
That they understand , for example , that the current assessment of the situation is that this is a moderate level , '' Fukuda said . 
The WHO and its 193 member states are working hard to prepare for a pandemic , for instance developing vaccines and building up supplies of anti-viral drugs , he said . 
The disease , which has infected over 26,500 people in 73 countries , with 140 deaths , has been most severe in Mexico , which has reported the highest number of fatalities , more than 100 . 
These include infections in otherwise healthy young people . 
A very real danger after declaring a pandemic was that hospitals could be overwhelmed by people seeking help when they did not really need it , while other patients requiring emergency treatment risked being neglected , according to Fukuda . 
`` In earlier pandemics , in earlier outbreaks , we have often seen that people who are in the category of being worried but who are not particularly sick , have overrun hospitals , '' he said . 
Since the new flu strain first appeared , many people have stopped eating pork , pigs have been culled in some countries , trade bans on meat imposed , travelers quarantined , and some countries have discussed closing borders . 
`` These are the kinds of potential adverse effects that you can have if you go out without making sure people understand the situation as well as possible , '' Fukuda said . 
Combining human , avian and swine viruses , the new strain has been dubbed ` swine flu ' , although scientists say this is misleading and stress there is no risk from eating pig meat . 
The world is better prepared but also more vulnerable to the adverse effects of a flu pandemic since the last one occurred in 1968 , due to the speed and volume of international travel . 
An H3N2 virus caused an estimated 1-4 million deaths at the time , and became known as Hong Kong flu . 
But Fukuda said the WHO would not name the new disease after a country or animal to avoid misleading stigmas . 
He voiced concern that Canadian Inuits had suffered disproportionately in the current outbreak , often needing hospitalization . 
It was not clear if this was due to higher levels of underlying chronic disease , genetics or poverty . 
`` Inuit populations were very severely hit in some of the earlier pandemics . 
This is why these reports raise such concerns to us , '' he said .

2009-06-09,"SINGAPORE , June 9 | Tue Jun 9 , 2009 5:33 am EDT SINGAPORE , June 9 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - GlaxoSmithKlyne -LRB- GSK . 
L -RRB- plans to start producing vaccines from 2011 in Singapore to fight pneumonia-causing bacteria , which kills more than 1 million children each year around the world . 
The world 's second biggest drugmaker opened a S$ 600 million -LRB- $ 411 million -RRB- plant in the city-state on Tuesday , its second global site to manufacture the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine after Belgium . 
GSK would take up to two years to test run the plant before commercial production starts , CEO Andrew Witty said . 
`` It is going to take a year or two to finally make sure all the production processes are running at the appropriate level of quality , '' Witty told reporters . 
The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine protects infants and children under age 2 from the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae , which causes diseases like pneumonia , meningitis , bronchitis , acute sinusitis and inflammation of the inner layer of the heart or endocarditis . 
Those kill nearly a million children worldwide each year , 90 percent of them in developing countries . 
The vaccine was introduced in 2000 in the United States and resulted in a sharp drop in pneumococcal disease in children , but is still unavailable in many underdeveloped countries , where it is most urgently needed , because of high costs . 
Witty said GSK 's new policy on price flexibility would make its vaccines and other drugs more affordable to poor nations . 
`` Vaccine is particularly important , a potential important product line for the emerging markets and Asia , '' he said . 
Witty welcomed a World Health Organisation recommendation last week that oral rotavirus vaccines be included in all national immunisation programs , but said they would not make a significant contribution to GSK 's revenues . 
`` I am excited about that . 
It 's great news , but that in itself is n't going to be a commercial opportunity , because obviously we are talking about product at much lower price being supplied to the developing world , '' Witty said . 
WHO 's new global guidance , aiming to avert half a million diarrhoeal deaths and 2 million hospitalisations a year , is expected to boost demand form Merck 's -LRB- MRK . 
N -RRB- and RotaTeq , GSK 's Rotarix vaccines in Africa and Asia . 
Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis , including vomiting and diarrhoea , in infants and young children .

2009-06-10,"The World Health Organization last declared a pandemic 41 years ago A sharp increase in swine flu cases in Australia may mean the infection has become a pandemic , the World Health Organization says . 
For that to happen , officials would have to verify that the disease had become established outside North America , where the crisis began . 
`` Once I get indisputable evidence , I will make the announcement , '' said WHO director general , Margaret Chan . 
More than 1,200 people have contracted the virus in Australia - none fatally . 
The total means Australia has seen a four-fold increase in a week . 
Less than a month ago the country had only a handful of cases of the H1N1 virus but it now has the highest number of infections outside North America . 
Victoria and the state capital , Melbourne , are the worst-hit with more than 1,000 confirmed cases . 
Most of those affected are suffering only a mild illness , but the Health Minister of Australia 's Queensland state , Paul Lucas , has warned that the contagious respiratory condition would inevitably claim lives . 
It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased The head of the WHO 's global influenza program , Keiji Fukuda , said the situation had `` evolved a lot '' in recent days . 
`` We are getting close to knowing that we are in a pandemic situation , '' he said . 
But Dr Fukuda urged calm . 
`` It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased or that people are getting seriously sick at higher numbers or higher rates than before , '' he said . 
Following the major outbreaks in North America the flu alert is currently at phase five of a six-level scale . 
The virus has infected more than 26,500 people in 73 countries . 
The WHO held a conference call with governments on Wednesday , but afterwards said no decision had been taken on moving to phase six - the pandemic stage - at the moment . 
Gregory Hartl , WHOs spokesperson for epidemic and pandemic diseases , said if a pandemic was announced it would not be the `` apocalyptic situation '' envisaged when bird flu looked liked it would be the cause . 
`` What we are seeing now with H1N1 is that in most cases the disease is self-limting , lets say 98-98 % of the people we know to be affected recover without any need for hospitalisation , as far as we can tell . 
`` We do understand that the natural reaction of people if and when we declare phase six could be very strong . 
`` But we would hope that there would be quiet quickly an adjustment reaction , as happened in the US , when people realized they were n't getting seriously ill . '' 
The media must play a part here , emphasising the facts about this virus and not over-reacting BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh says it is true that the word `` pandemic '' sounds scary . 
But it simply means a global epidemic of an infectious disease . 
He says it is not a signal that the virus is getting more virulent - only a measure of its geographical spread . 
As the number of H1N1 cases in Australia passes 1,200 , Singapore has urged its citizens to avoid travel to Victoria . 
Authorities in New South Wales and South Australia , as well as the national capital , Canberra , have told children who have recently traveled to Melbourne to stay away from school for a week on their return home . 
The entire squad and staff of the Brisbane Broncos rugby league club have been put into quarantine as tests are carried out on a player suspected of contracting swine flu .

2009-06-10,"H1N1 flu vaccine a step closer as firms test seed LONDON | Wed Jun 10 , 2009 2:10 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Drugmakers are on track to have a vaccine against the new H1N1 strain of flu ready for the northern hemisphere autumn after receiving seed virus samples , company officials said on Wednesday . 
Sanofi-Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline , Novartis and Solvay all said their vaccine teams had obtained the new influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- seed virus within the past fortnight , enabling them to begin the production process . 
What is still unclear , however , is how much vaccine they will be able to manufacture , since this depends on how easily the new virus strain grows within a commercial production environment . 
`` It will probably take a couple of weeks to ascertain the yields before we get into large-scale manufacture , '' a Glaxo spokesman said . 
The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said on Tuesday it was on the verge of declaring the first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years . 
It is concerned at the sustained spread of the H1N1 strain -- including more than 1,000 cases in Australia -- following major outbreaks in North America , where it emerged in April . 
Confirmed community spread in a second region beyond North America would trigger moving to phase 6 on the U.N. agency 's six-step disease scale , signifying a full-blown pandemic . 
Recent investment in flu vaccine capacity means companies are in far better shape to meet the challenge of a pandemic than in the past . 
They are also well advanced in manufacturing supplies of the normal seasonal flu shot , allowing them to switch some capacity to making a pandemic H1N1 vaccine over the coming months . 
As a result , there could be windfall sales and profits this year for leading suppliers , some of which have already won orders for H1N1 vaccine from governments in Europe and North America . 
Although the H1N1 flu strain seems mild at present , health officials are worried it might return in a more virulent form in the northern hemisphere winter . 
The WHO estimates vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots a year in the best-case scenario , though this will still not be enough for the entire world population of more than 6.5 billion , particularly if it turns out that people need more than one injection to gain immunity . 
The 4.9 billion estimate would be significantly lower if there was no wholesale switch from seasonal to pandemic flu vaccine-making . 
The H1N1 vaccine now being developed by companies must be tested first on ferrets and then on humans in clinical trials before regulatory authorities can approve it .

2009-06-11,"WHO declares swine flu pandemic The Director General of the World Health Organization , Margaret Chan , has formally declared that the swine flu outbreak is now a global pandemic ; the first global flu epidemic in 41 years . 
In a statement , the WHO says it decided to raise the pandemic alert level from phase five to six , meaning the swine flu virus is spreading in at least two regions of the world . 
The move does not necessarily mean the virus is causing more severe illness or more deaths . 
So what does the declaration mean ? 
Dr Christopher Fraser from Imperial College London is on the World Health Organisation Pandemic Influenza Task Force .

2009-06-11,"Dr Chan said the pandemic would be of '' moderate severity '' The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- has declared a global flu pandemic after holding an emergency meeting . 
It means the swine flu virus is spreading in at least two regions of the world with rising cases being seen in the UK , Australia , Japan and Chile . 
WHO chief Dr Margaret Chan said the move did not mean the virus was causing more severe illness or more deaths . 
The swine flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus first emerged in Mexico in April and has since spread to 74 countries . 
We have evidence to suggest we are seeing the first pandemic of the 21st Century Dr Margaret Chan , WHO director general Official reports say there have been nearly 30,000 cases globally and 141 deaths , with figures rising daily . 
Hong Kong said it was closing all its nurseries and primary schools for two weeks following 12 school cases . 
It is the first flu pandemic in 40 years - the last in 1968 killed about one million people . 
However , the current pandemic seems to be moderate and causing mild illness in most people . 
Most cases are occurring in young working age adults and a third to a half of complications are presenting in otherwise healthy people . 
Dr Chan said : `` We have evidence to suggest we are seeing the first pandemic of the 21st Century . 
`` Moving to pandemic phase six does not imply we will see increased in deaths or serious cases . '' 
She added it was important to get the right balance between complacency and vigilance and that pandemic strategies would vary between countries depending on their specific situation . 
It is global and fulfilling the requirements of a pandemic Professor John Oxford , flu expert And the WHO does not recommend closure of borders or any restrictions on the movement of people , goods or services . 
But the picture could change very quickly . 
`` No other pandemic has been detected so early or watched so closely , '' Dr Chan said . 
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for calm . 
`` Let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease . 
It is not in itself a cause for alarm , '' he said . 
He warned that in the developing world the consequences of the virus could be more serious , and that the southern hemisphere was now entering the flu season . 
One factor which has prompted the move to a level six pandemic was that in the southern hemisphere , the virus seems to be crowding out normal seasonal influenza . 
Pandemic ` no cause for alarm ' The move was not prompted by the situation in any one country but the reports that it had spread in several parts of the world , officials said . 
The BBC 's Imogen Foulkes , in Geneva , says that while the number of cases has made the declaration inevitable , the WHO will have to manage the global anxiety the declaration of a pandemic will generate . 
Experts have warned that poorer nations , especially those in the southern hemisphere now heading into their winter season , face the greatest risk from the flu pandemic . 
There have been more than 800 cases in the UK with some areas of Scotland being particularly hard hit . 
The government has been stockpiling antivirals such as Tamiflu and has ordered vaccine , some doses of which could be available by October . 
SWINE FLU - THE BASICS Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Current treatments do work , but as yet there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised England 's chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson said the WHO declaration of a pandemic would not significantly change the way the UK was dealing with swine flu at the moment . 
But he added there could be some minor changes to who received antivirals . 
`` The declaration of a pandemic per se does n't make a big difference to the way we are handling the outbreaks we have . 
`` We are going to continue to investigate every case that occurs and treat their contacts with antivirals even though they may not be ill . 
`` The difference is that the Health Protection Agency has learned a lot about approaching this question of antiviral prophylaxis and they are going to be treating the closer contacts of the cases , rather than the more far-flung contacts , because they feel that that is supported by what they know so far about how the disease is transmitting . 
He added : `` These flu viruses can change their pattern of attack , so when we come into the flu season in the autumn and winter in this country , when we expect a big surge of cases , we need to watch very carefully to see if the character of the virus is changing . '' 
There is concern that the virus might mutate in the southern hemisphere over its winter and become more virulent , but there 's no sign of that yet Scottish health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said a move to level six means that countries need to be ready to implement pandemic plans immediately but the UK was already operating at a `` heightened state of readiness '' . 
But it could affect the speed at which the UK gets pandemic vaccine supplies but that had been factored into pandemic planning . 
Flu expert Professor John Oxford said people should not panic as the outbreak was milder than others seen in the past century . 
`` It is global and fulfilling the requirements of a pandemic but I do n't think anyone should worry because nothing drastic has happened between yesterday and today . ''

Is a low energy house really possible ? 
Plus , how does the swine flu model work ? 
; the new anti-biotic technique ; and why we are safer than we thought from inter-planetary collision . 
All new housing must be zero-carbon by 2016 according to government policy , but is such a commitment even meaningful ? 
The aim seems worthy , but experts say that new homes often use twice the energy expected , partly because the engineering science is too poor . 
As the UK research councils pour new money into eco-engineering , Quentin Cooper hears about the challenges of low-carbon housing . 
The WHO appear likely to announce that the H1N1 swine flu outbreak has indeed reached pandemic level . 
Quentin speaks to the epidemiologist who published , in the journal Science , some of the first predictions . 
Is it turning out as they expected ? 
A compound designed to attack the DNA of cancer cells failed . 
Instead , researchers at the University of Warwick tried it out on infectious bacteria , and it killed them in minutes . 
Could it be the new secret weapon in our dwindling anti-biotic arsenal ? 
Plus the news stories of impending planetary collision , albeit in billions of years time , are examined . 
Actually , the work published in the journal Nature , the result of some of the most powerful computing in the world , suggests to astronomers that inter-planetary collision is instead less likely than they feared .

2009-06-11,"Many countries already have swine flu precautions in place UN health officials are expected to declare the first global flu pandemic in 40 years , after holding emergency talks on the swine flu crisis . 
The World Health Organization called the meeting after a steep rise in the number of cases in Australia . 
A BBC correspondent says it has little option but to declare a pandemic now there are nearly 28,000 recorded cases . 
Reports say that the WHO had already told member countries it had decided to raise the alert to pandemic level . 
Hong Kong said it was closing all its nurseries and primary schools for two weeks following 12 school cases . 
The last global flu pandemic came in 1968 over the Hong Kong flu . 
That pandemic killed about one million people . 
A disease is classed as a pandemic when transmission between humans becomes widespread in at least two regions of the world . 
The latest virus emerged in Mexico in April and since then thousands of cases have been confirmed throughout North and South America . 
The H1N1 strain has spread to 74 countries but the WHO has so far resisted labeling the outbreak a full-blown pandemic . 
SWINE FLU - THE BASICS Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Current treatments do work , but there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised WHO chief Margaret Chan talked to officials from eight countries with large flu outbreaks on Wednesday in an attempt to confirm the spread of the disease . 
She said she believed the situation could be regarded as a pandemic but wanted clear evidence before making an announcement . 
The BBC 's Imogen Foulkes , in Geneva , says that while the number of cases has made the declaration inevitable , the problem is that the pandemic phase system is designed for a very different type of virus . 
WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said it had been expecting something more like the deadlier bird flu . 
`` It was believed that the next pandemic would be something like H5N1 bird flu , where you were seeing really high death rates , and so there were people who believed we might be in a kind of apocalyptic situation and what we 're really seeing now with H1N1 is that in most cases the disease is self-limiting , '' he told the BBC . 
Phase 1 : No infections in humans are being caused by viruses circulating in animals . 
Phase 2 : Animal flu virus causes infection in humans , and is a potential pandemic threat . 
Phase 3 : Flu causes sporadic cases in people , but no significant human-to-human transmission . 
Phase 4 : Human-to-human transmission and community-level outbreaks . 
Phase 5 : Human-to-human transmission in at least two countries . 
Strong signal pandemic imminent . 
Phase 6 : Virus spreads to another country in a different region . 
Global pandemic under way . 
Post-peak : Pandemic activity appears to be decreasing though second wave possible . 
Post-pandemic : activity returns to normal , seasonal flu levels . 
BACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT `` Let 's say 98 or 99 % of the people we so far know to be affected recover without any need of hospitalisation . 
The WHO will have to manage the global anxiety the declaration of a pandemic will generate , our correspondent says . 
It is concerned not to trigger panic measures such as border closures and travel bans and is expected to advocate careful medical management , including the moderate use of anti-viral drug tamiflu . 
Using it on a widespread preventative scale could simply create drug resistance , our correspondent adds . 
The WHO 's move follows Australia 's confirmation of more than 1,200 cases - a four-fold increase in a week . 
All primary schools and nurseries in Hong Kong are to shut for 14 days from Friday in a bid to contain the virus , the territory 's chief executive Donald Tsang said . 
It follows confirmation that 12 secondary school pupils have contracted the illness . 
Secondary schools are not yet being ordered to close . 
At least 50 people are now confirmed to have the virus in the territory . 
The head of the WHO 's global influenza program , Keiji Fukuda , said the situation had `` evolved a lot '' in recent days . 
`` We are getting close to knowing that we are in a pandemic situation , '' he said . 
Although most sufferers experience normal flu symptoms and make a full recovery , the WHO has confirmed 141 deaths from 27,737 cases .

2009-06-11,"UK plays down swine flu pandemic implications Health officials say WHO 's declaration is to do with geography , not deadliness of the virus Thursday 11 June 2009 16.17 BST Nicola Sturgeon , the Scottish health minister . 
who said her strategy was to mitigate the spread of swine flu . 
Photograph : David Moir\/Reuters The formal declaration of a global flu pandemic is bound to trigger anxiety and possibly panic . 
It 's one thing to say Britain is having outbreaks of swine flu but quite another to talk of being in the grip of a fully fledged , officially designated worldwide pandemic . 
But public health officials in the UK are already trying to talk down the implications of the World Health Organisation moving the alert status from level 5 to level 6 , the highest . 
Swine flu in most countries has been mild and there have been no signs of it becoming more deadly . 
The pandemic tag is to do with geography , public health experts say , and not severity . 
Swine flu has to be officially designated a pandemic because it is spreading easily in two distinct regions , the Americas and now Australia . 
In England , the Health Protection Agency , which is notified of every case , says there is no sustained transmission and containment of the virus is still the policy . 
`` We still have cases that have been linked to an outbreak , such as in schools , or linked to other cases , '' said a spokeswoman . 
`` The big change would be if we had sporadic cases . '' 
Scotland is taking a different tack . 
The Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , told the parliament this morning that hospital cases in Scotland were at similar rates to the United States . 
There are 311 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Scotland , more than a third of the UK 's total , with cases heavily concentrated in the Glasgow area . 
By yesterday , 18 people had been admitted to hospital , with five in intensive care or high-dependency units . 
Fifteen schools and nurseries are either entirely or partly closed . 
Sturgeon says containment has failed , so the strategy in Scotland is to mitigate the spread . 
Doctors in the worst-affected areas Glasgow , Dunoon and Paisley will be allowed to make a swine flu diagnosis in their surgeries rather than wait for specialist or laboratory tests . 
Only the closest contacts of infected people will be given the antiviral drug Tamiflu . 
`` We have seen a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Scotland over the past 10 days , '' Sturgeon told parliament . 
`` Based on this experience , Health Protection Scotland has expressed the view that sustained community transmission appears to be taking place . '' 
In England , the containment strategy continues for now . 
Every case is reported and close contacts are given Tamiflu , which reduces the flu 's duration and severity . 
Where schoolchildren have fallen ill , every pupil has been given the drug and most schools involved though not all have been closed . 
The aim is to stop swine flu spreading . 
If containment fails , that policy will end , and stocks of Tamiflu will be preserved for those most at risk of severe illness . 
There will be no more mass dosing of schoolchildren . 
Little else will change with the official pandemic announcement . 
The government is rolling out its anti-pandemic strategy as fast as it can because there is every possibility that swine flu could do a lot more damage once the winter flu season starts . 
Plans involve sending antiviral drugs and antibiotics to all GPs , and advertising campaigns telling people to wash their hands and if they fall ill , to stay at home , call the flu line and get a friend to collect their drugs .

2009-06-11,"cents H1N1 virus becomes world 's first pandemic in 41 years cents 848 cases in Britain and more than 27,000 worldwide Thursday 11 June 2009 18.39 BST Swine flu has become the world 's first official pandemic in 41 years after the World Health Organisation raised the alert level on the H1N1 virus from phase 5 to 6 , the highest on the scale . 
The decision was made after a meeting of experts in Geneva today and comes as infections have climbed in Europe , the US , Australia , South America and elsewhere . 
The WHO chief , Dr Margaret Chan , yesterday examined data from eight countries with large numbers of swine flu cases . 
`` The world is moving into the early days of its first influenza pandemic in the 21st century , '' Chan told reporters tonight , advising that countries should prepare for a second wave of cases . 
`` The -LRB- swine flu -RRB- virus is now unstoppable . '' 
Raising the alert level reflects that the virus is more widespread , but not necessarily more dangerous although there are fears that infections could overwhelm hospitals and health authorities , especially in poorer countries . 
Another 25 cases of swine flu have been confirmed in England and 26 more in Scotland , taking the UK total to 848 . 
Speaking to health service managers in Liverpool at a conference of NHS trusts , the UK 's new health secretary , Andy Burnham , said : `` It 's not a cause for alarm . 
It does n't change our plans . '' 
Sarah Boseley : ` The only deaths are in Mexico , USA and Canada ' Link to this audio Swine flu originated in Mexico in April and has spread to 74 countries , infecting more than 27,700 people and killing 140 . 
Most cases have been mild , although employers are being warned to prepare for absences through illness . 
The WHO said pharmaceutical companies should start making swine flu vaccine . 
One manufacturer , GlaxoSmithKline PLC , said it could start large-scale production by July but large quantities would not be available for several months . 
Despite the WHO 's hopes , the announcement of a pandemic will almost certainly spark panic in some countries . 
Fear has already gripped Argentina , where thousands of people worried about swine flu flooded into hospitals this week , bringing to near-collapse the emergency health services in the capital , Buenos Aires . 
`` People might imagine a virus is now going to rush in and kill everyone , '' said John Oxford , a professor of virology at St Bart 's and Royal London hospital . 
`` That 's not going to happen . '' 
There are 337 cases in Scotland and health officials in Edinburgh said 30 % of them were in young adults aged 15-24 . 
The Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said public health tactics had changed after it emerged the virus was spreading uncontrolled . 
Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament this morning that hospitalisation rates were similar to those in the US . 
She indicated that attempts to contain the virus had failed and the strategy would be to limit its spread . 
Doctors in the most-affected areas Glasgow , Dunoon and Paisley would be allowed to make a swine flu diagnosis in their surgeries rather than wait for specialist or laboratory tests . 
England 's chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , said health officials were expecting to see more and more cases this autumn and winter with the return of the traditional flu season , and the virus might yet change and become more severe . 
There were `` very strong '' plans in place to deal with the flu and so far the government 's approach , including closing schools where necessary , appeared to have worked well , he said . 
At the NHS Confederation conference , senior health service managers held an early-morning session to refine their emergency plans . 
Contingency arrangements are being drawn up to allow for hospitals and health centres to continue operating when as many as 40 % of staff are off sick . 
Steve Barnett , the chief executive of the NHS Confederation , which represents most health and ambulance trusts , said : `` The confirmation of a level 6 global pandemic reinforces the need for the NHS to ensure all the flu plans already in place at local level are as comprehensive as possible and thoroughly tested . 
`` We need to avoid complacency in dealing with a virus that is an unknown and seems to be spreading quickly . '' 
The last such pandemic was the Hong Kong flu of 1968 that killed about a million people . 
Ordinary flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people each year . 
"
2009-06-11,"We are well prepared for swine flu That the public is not panicking as the WHO raises the status of the outbreak to pandemic shows the success of our preparations For the first time in 40 years , a global pandemic is upon us , as indicated by the World Health Organisation raising the flu alert level to phase six . 
With the number of recorded cases of swine flu in Australia , Canada and Mexico hitting four figures ; in the UK doubling in a week to more than 750 ; and in the US passing 13,000 , the move has been inevitable . 
It is about six weeks since the WHO raised the status to phase five , the first indication that a pandemic was imminent . 
It has been interesting to observe different sectors of society have reacted . 
For the media , the move to phase five was quite rightly a big story which was , equally appropriately , given a good deal of coverage . 
So far , however , there has been only a handful of cases to report , and these people appear to have suffered little more than a bad cold , leaving the public -LRB- and even some journalists -RRB- slightly baffled at what all the fuss is about or even if we should be making a fuss at all . 
For the government , the health sector and emergency planners across the UK and indeed the world it has been a different story . 
Largely behind the scenes , plans that were drawn up , tested , exercised and refined over more than a decade have begun to swing into place , just as the WHO intended : its definition of phase five includes the warning that a pandemic `` is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization , communication and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short '' . 
Most visible among this activity has been the government 's printing and distribution of the leaflet Important Information About Swine Flu -LRB- pdf -RRB- , the activation of the information helpline and the accompanying media campaign . 
Note exactly what this means : the public now has the information it needs to mitigate the effects of an outbreak as much as it can . 
The phoneline organisers will have had time to call in the additional operators needed , to ensure they are well-trained and comfortable with the queries they will receive and to iron out bugs in the system while the number of calls it has been receiving is small . 
This picture is mirrored across the country , which is why the WHO considers the UK to be one of the two best - prepared countries in the world . 
Over the last six weeks , anyone with a direct role in responding to a pandemic has been quietly but efficiently gearing up for it . 
Hospitals have been preparing to deal with extra patients , scientists have been working to develop a vaccine to this specific strain and local health authorities have been planning how these vaccines will be distributed and administered . 
It is also important to remember that we are extremely lucky that the type of flu we are now facing , Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , is a less deadly strain than might have mutated from the H5N1 bird flu many scientists expected . 
This means that the pandemic we are facing will affect only the quantity of victims , not the quality of their illness ; if you catch swine flu you have no more chance of dying from it than if you catch any other type of flu , but you do have more chance of catching it . 
The doomsday predictions of 750,000 UK dead are , thankfully , unlikely to be realized . 
But this does not make it all a fuss about nothing . 
The very old , the very ill and people with compromised immune systems , such as diabetics and those with Aids , often do die from flu and this year more of them will catch it . 
Hospitals will have to cope with an increased number of admissions , possibly while their staff is depleted by illness . 
This will become more acute as we head into the winter months , as Australia has seen , though the heads-up we have been given means that with luck we may by then have a vaccine . 
We should be proud that swine flu seems to be a bit of a fuss about nothing . 
That the public does not , by and large , feel frightened and is not panicking is a measure of the success with which the UK has prepared for this outbreak and has dealt with it so far . 
From national flu pandemic exercises such as 2007 's Winter Willow , to countless smaller exercises that take place across the UK every month , to the pages of information that can be found on NHS and government websites , the UK is as well prepared as it can be to deal with the effects of the global flu pandemic we now face .

2009-06-11,"BERLIN | Thu Jun 11 , 2009 7:40 am EDT BERLIN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - German authorities have confirmed 30 cases of the H1N1 flu at a school in the western city of Dusseldorf , the most concentrated outbreak of the virus so far in Europe 's largest economy . 
The health ministry in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia said on Thursday the majority of the cases at a Japanese school in the city were detected on Wednesday evening . 
Additional confirmed infections were likely to emerge , said Kathrin Rebbe , a spokeswoman for the ministry . 
Parents of the infected children and people who had been in contact with them would be tested on Thursday , said Heiko Schneitler , head of the city health 's authority . 
Most of the children affected were Japanese , he said . 
One of the children was confirmed with H1N1 last week , and had recently been to Malta , a spokesman for the health authority said . 
The children are now in quarantine , he added . 
The school has been closed until the end of next week , said Hiromi Kida , a senior official at the school . 
Dusseldorf is home to a large Japanese community . 
Rebbe at the NRW health ministry said four additional cases of H1N1 had been detected at a school in nearby Cologne . 
Germany had 86 confirmed cases of H1N1 prior to the school infections , according to the Robert Koch Institute , the country 's federal agency for infectious diseases .

`` Today ... the Minister for Elderly Care and Public Health Maria Larsson has called a press conference following a decision by the WHO to raise the pandemic level to six for the influensa A H1N1 virus . '' 
The WHO has said that phase six would reflect the fact that the disease , widely known as swine flu , is spreading geographically , but not necessarily indicate how virulent it is .

2009-06-11,"New flu has been around for years in pigs : study By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Thu Jun 11 , 2009 6:08 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new H1N1 virus , which has caused the first pandemic of the 21st century , appears to have been circulating undetected among pigs for years , researchers reported on Thursday . 
Although health officials have been watching for new influenza viruses in humans , animal health regulators have missed the opportunity to check swine , the researchers reported . 
Britons Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh and Oliver Pybus of Oxford University , and Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong examined the genetic sequence of the new H1N1 swine flu virus . 
Like others who have done the same , they show it is a mixture of other viruses that had been circulating in pigs , one of which was itself a mixture including swine , human and avian-like genetic sequences . 
`` We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine , and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak , '' they wrote . 
`` Movement of live pigs between Eurasia and North America seems to have facilitated the mixing of diverse swine influenza viruses , leading to the multiple reassortment events associated with the genesis of the -LRB- new H1N1 -RRB- strain , '' they added . 
`` Yet despite widespread influenza surveillance in humans , the lack of systematic swine surveillance allowed for the undetected persistence and evolution of this potentially pandemic strain for many years . '' 
They said this new pandemic `` provides further evidence of the role of domestic pigs in the ecosystem of influenza A. '' The new virus , which was first reported in two U.S. children in March , apparently infected people as early as last January in Mexico , health officials have said . 
The World Health Organization declared it a full pandemic on Thursday , meaning it is circulating globally and can not be stopped . 
The international team also used a `` molecular clock '' method to compare the current virus to its relatives and estimate its age based on the mutations . 
This gives a rough idea of when the new virus is likely to have emerged . 
`` We found that the common ancestor of the -LRB- new H1N1 -RRB- outbreak and the closest related swine viruses existed between 9.2 and 17.2 years ago , depending on the genomic segment , hence the ancestors of the epidemic have been circulating undetected for about a decade , '' they wrote . 
`` Thus , this genomic structure may have been circulating in pigs for several years before emergence in humans , '' they added . 
The pork industry has been vociferously protesting use of the term `` swine flu '' to describe the virus . 
Fears that the pandemic would affect pork prices caused World Health Organization officials to use the generic designation of `` influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- '' -- which also refers to one of the current seasonal flu strains . 
Last week the U.S. Agriculture Department said it would launch a pilot surveillance project to look for new strains of flu virus in pigs . 
Also last week , Gerardo Nava of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and colleagues reported that their genetic analysis also pointed to North American swine as a potential source of the new virus . 
Cooked pork is no threat but live pigs can get influenza as easily as people do and people and pigs can sometimes pass viruses back and forth .

2009-06-11,"GENEVA | Thu Jun 11 , 2009 7:03 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic on Thursday and advised governments to prepare for a long-term battle against an unstoppable new flu virus . 
The United Nations agency raised its pandemic flu alert to phase 6 on a six-point scale , indicating the first influenza pandemic since 1968 is under way . 
`` With today 's announcement , WHO moves from an emergency to a longer-term response . 
Based on past experience , this pandemic will be with us for some months , if not years , to come , '' WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said in a letter to staff , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters . 
People aged 30-50 , pregnant women or people suffering from chronic conditions such as asthma , diabetes or obesity are at highest risk , Chan told a news conference . 
Countries from Australia to Chile and the United States are reporting the new swine flu virus is `` crowding out '' seasonal flu , becoming the predominant influenza strain , she said . 
For now the virus was `` pretty stable , '' but Chan warned that it could still change into a more deadly form , perhaps mixing with the H5N1 bird flu virus circulating widely in poultry . 
`` So it is incumbent on WHO and all members to stay vigilant and alert for the next year or two or even beyond , '' she said . 
There is also a risk the swine flu could mix with its seasonal H1N1 cousin , which has developed resistance to the main antiviral flu drug Tamiflu , made by Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc , Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a separate briefing . 
The United States has been operating on pandemic status for weeks , with hundreds of thousands of cases and at least 1,000 hospitalizations , Schuchat said . 
The virus disproportionately makes younger people sick . 
Some 57 percent of U.S. cases were among people aged 5 to 24 , and 41 percent of those hospitalized were in this younger age group . 
H1N1 is active in all 50 states and there are so many cases now that in some areas , patients with specific flu-like symptoms -- a fever above 104 degrees F -LRB- 40 degrees C -RRB- , cough or other respiratory symptoms -- are presumed to have the new virus . 
WHO reiterated its advice to its 193 member countries not to close borders or impose travel restrictions to halt the movement of people , goods and services , a call echoed by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . 
`` We must guard against rash and discriminatory actions such as travel bans or trade restrictions , '' Ban told a news conference at U.N. headquarters . 
The move to phase 6 reflects the fact that the disease , widely known as swine flu , is spreading geographically , but does not indicate how virulent it is . 
Widespread transmission of the virus in Australia , signaling that it is entrenched in another region besides North America , was one of the key triggers for moving to phase 6 . 
`` We are satisfied that this virus is spreading to a number of countries and it is not stoppable , '' Chan said . 
`` Moving to pandemic phase 6 level does not imply we will see an increase in the number of deaths or very severe cases . 
Quite on the contrary . 
Many people are having mild disease , they recover without medicines in some cases and it is good news , '' she said . 
`` Although the pandemic appears to have moderate severity in comparatively well-off countries , it is prudent to anticipate a bleaker picture as the virus spreads to areas with limited resources , poor health care , and a high prevalence of underlying medical problems , '' she added . 
Canadian health officials said they were concerned about reports of more severe symptoms in some aboriginal communities , but said it was too soon to say for sure . 
`` To make conclusions based on a couple of communities that this is somehow a disease that is worse in a particular ethnic group . 
It 's much too early to make any of those kinds of conclusions or presumptions , '' said Dr. David Butler-Jones , Canada 's chief public health officer . 
Chan said WHO would start distributing a further donation of 5.65 million courses of Tamiflu from Roche . 
WHO recommended drugmakers stay on track to complete production of seasonal influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere 's next winter in the next two weeks . 
Each year , normal flu kills up to 500,000 people and infects millions . 
Work on developing an H1N1 vaccine is already under way at leading companies , whose factories will be ready to switch to making a pandemic shot in around two weeks ' time , when normal season flu vaccine production is complete . 
Seasonal flu affects mainly the elderly and causes severe illness in millions , so a premature switch in vaccine production to cope with the new strain could put many people at risk . 
`` So our recommendation is they need to finish the seasonal vaccine and then move over , '' Chan said . 
Chan said the Geneva-based agency would work with regulatory authorities to help fast-track approval of new pandemic vaccines that are safe and effective so that they can be made available as soon as possible . 
In any case , the first doses would only be available in September , she added . 
A pandemic could cause enormous disruption to business as workers stay home because they are sick or to look after family members and authorities restrict gatherings of large numbers of people or movement of people or goods . 
World markets shrugged off the pandemic , as investors focused on possible global economic recovery . 
The strain , which emerged in April in Mexico and the United States , has spread widely . 
There have been 28,774 infections confirmed in 74 countries to date , including 144 deaths , according to WHO 's latest tally of laboratory-confirmed cases .

2009-06-12,"Flu hits Canada 's native peoples It is unclear why swine flu rates are higher in Inuit communities Canada is investigating whether Inuit communities may be particularly badly hit by swine flu , health officials say . 
The World Health Organization thinks there are more cases than expected among young people in the aboriginal population living in northern Canada . 
Recent days have seen a spike in H1N1 flu among the Inuit and the country 's isolated indigenous communities . 
The swine flu virus can have more serious effects on people living in poverty , the WHO says . 
Of fewer than 100 people infected in Nunavut , the vast Arctic homeland of Inuits , 10 were admitted to hospital . 
In Manitoba province , 16 of the 24 people in intensive care because of swine flu are from native communities . 
The BBC 's Lee Carter in Toronto says there are no clear reasons why swine flu rates are higher in Canada 's indigenous communities . 
But poverty , substandard , overcrowded housing and underlying health problems are thought to be the most likely culprits , he says . 
Canada 's federal health minister , Leona Aglukkaq , who is herself Inuit , said additional personnel and supplies have been sent to the Inuit communities . 
`` This is a concern and we are investigating , '' she said . 
`` We must resist speculation , rely on the science and report only on confirmed cases . '' 
Four people have died from swine flu in Canada though most of the 2,978 confirmed cases have been mild . 
"
2009-06-12,"Malaria is more deadly than swine flu Perhaps the alarm caused over swine flu will help us empathise with the victims of other diseases that are killing millions It is no mean feat to knock Ronaldo off the front pages , especially when the self-regarding Portuguese footballer has just broken the club record for a transfer fee . 
But yesterday the World Health Organisation 's Margaret Chan achieved just that by declaring the first influenza pandemic in 40 years . 
Never mind that to date H1N1 swine flu has killed just 144 people worldwide . 
With 1,300 cases now being reported in Australia , and simultaneous community outbreaks in Chile , Japan and the United States , Chan said scientists had concluded that transmission was `` unstoppable '' hence the decision to declare a maximum pandemic alert at level six . 
The subtext of Chan 's message was that this was no time for complacency : with the winter flu season in Australia now well underway , hospital admissions in Melbourne have quadrupled in recent weeks . 
If the virus maintains its present level of virulence then experts are predicting that a third of the British population could be infected this autumn and as many as 36,000 could die about three times as many as in a normal flu season . 
But `` could '' is not the same as `` will '' , and looking round the world you will find many more mortal and , arguably , more present threats to global health . 
Take HIV\/Aids , for instance , a disease that has been pandemic , or at least has been spreading at epidemic levels in Africa , for 30 years . 
In 2007 , the latest year for which figures are available , Aids-related illness killed 2 million people worldwide , including 270,000 children . 
But because two-thirds of the 33 million people annually infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa and the remainder belong , by and large , to discrete `` high-risk '' groups such as intravenous drug users , HIV no longer blips on our radar screens . 
I have just returned from western Cambodia , where scientists are now reporting the first signs of parasite resistance to the world 's current frontline anti-malarial , artemisinin . 
Malaria , along with diarrhoeal diseases and pneumonia , is one of the leading causes of infant mortality in Cambodia . 
And in Uganda and other high malaria transmission countries in Africa , it is also a major killer of pregnant women -LRB- the WHO estimates that some 3,000 people a day die from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa every day , the majority of them women and children -RRB- . 
Unlike influenza , as yet we have no vaccine against malaria . 
Indeed , artemisinin is currently the best , and in some parts of the world , the only effective treatment against the deadliest strains of the parasitical disease . 
In other words , if resistance to artemisinin spreads worldwide as occurred with choloroquine in the 1960s then we have nothing else in the locker . 
This may not matter to you now : but it could well matter to you if you travel to Kenya and the prophylactic your GP has prescribed fails , or if your child is hospitalized with falciparum malaria during his or her gap-year travels . 
Yet as with HIV , malaria strains our empathy . 
`` When one has fought a war , one hardly knows what a dead person is , '' wrote Albert Camus in The Plague . 
`` And if a dead man has no significance unless one has seen him dead , a hundred million bodies spread through history are just a mist drifting through the imagination . '' 
Or as a taxi driver in York put it en route to York University 's biology department where scientists are currently breeding high-yielding strains of Artemisia Annua , the plant from which artemisinin is derived , to produce sufficient quantities of the drug for Cambodia `` Unless it affects someone in my family , why should I care ? '' 
H1N1 of course could affect that taxi driver 's family and the families of millions of Britons like him . 
Unlike seasonal strains of influenza , which are usually only dangerous to infants and the over-65s , H1N1 swine flu like the 1918 H1N1 `` Spanish '' influenza virus appears to be hitting the under-25s hardest , hence the importance of WHO 's declaration yesterday and the stepping-up of vaccine production before the autumn -LRB- at present , experts predict there will only be enough vaccine to inoculate half the British population -RRB- . 
Yet , for all the concern about an influenza pandemic , we should keep in mind that WHO 's announcement was first and foremost an exercise in risk assessment : a signal to governments who have yet to activate their pandemic plans to pull their fingers out . 
Its use of the term is also the reflection of changing definitions . 
In the past , WHO defined an influenza pandemic as causing `` enormous numbers of deaths and illness '' . 
By contrast , the current definition requires only `` community-level outbreaks '' in two continents at the same time a test that was actually met several weeks ago . 
That WHO has delayed announcing the inevitable until now is an indication of how worried United Nations member states have become of fuelling panic at a time when the world economy is just beginning to shown faltering signs of recovery from the credit crunch . 
But while Chan recognized there was a danger of people overreacting , she argued that the greater danger was `` complacency '' . 
She also warned that while a level six pandemic alert did not mean the virus was becoming more dangerous or that we should expect to see an increase in mortality in developed nations , there was no telling how H1N1 would behave `` under conditions typically found in the developing world '' . 
If panicking about an influenza pandemic can help us empathise with the plight of the invisible victims of infectious diseases and make those global health connections , so much the better . 
Like the HIV virus and drug-resistant malaria parasites , H1N1 is no respecter of borders . 
And whether we drive a taxi in York or live in a mud hut in Yemen , we can be bitten at any time . 
Time for a ban .

2009-06-12,"Could you please review your estimated mortality rate for Swine flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . 
It is wrong to give the impression that the mortality rate is 5-6 % . 
In the right hands , with access to modern healthcare , the mortality rate is probably similar to normal seasonal flu or a little higher . 
Its very difficult to make true estimates of mortality as the disease is evolving but 5-6 % is too high . 
Having a mortality rate similar to normal seasonal flu is not a reason for countries to lower their guard though . 
This infection seems to have a `` hospitalisation rate '' of around 2 % which is likely to put huge pressures on hospitals as they go into Autumn and Winter seasons . 
... and on that note , is the mortality rate of regular seasonal flu really \* 98 % \* for those over 65 ? 
I find that very hard to believe . 
But if this is really the case then I will certainly recommend that my parents have their annual flu jab from now on ! 
According to the WHO , laboratory-confirmed cases of new influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- as officially reported to WHO as of 17:00 GMT 15 June 2009 are : ... giving a Mortality Rate of 0.45 % . 
If the the Lab-confirmed cases are indicative of the spread and impact of infections to date , then the mortality rate of `` 5 % to 6 % '' as reported in the graphic above is overly excessive -LRB- unless , ACTUAL deaths are a lot higher than REPORTED deaths -RRB- . 
The 5 to 6 % in Mexico would be an initial number based on limited information in April . 
Currently , Mexico has reported 6241 cases with 108 deaths which is a rate of 1.7 % . 
However , their testing is not as inclusive as the testing that is occuring in other countries , so it is very likely that there are many more cases . 
The actual rate is more than likely equivalent to the current global rate of 0.4 % -LRB- 167 deaths , 39620 cases -RRB- . 
However , this number is greatly influenced by the Mexico numbers . 
The United States has the next highest number of identified cases . 
Their approximate rate is 0.2 % -LRB- 44 deaths , 17855 cases -RRB- . 
Also keep in mind that these rates only account for identified cases . 
There are many more that have not been tested and are not included in the numbers . 
How on earth do you have the mortality rate calculated for H1 N1 ? 
It is nowhere near as high as 5-6 % . 
I think the chart is very misleading . 
As to not repeat history , we must be wary of influenza and the characteristics that it posses to survive . 
Even though this first wave seems innocuous as it did during the 1918 pandemic , we can not let our guard down . 
Numbers , hospitalizations and current death rates do not encumber all aspects of the seemingly mild influenza season , so that it is ... The next wave of the flu is what we should prepare for . 
This is the sort of irresponsible rubbish that is fuelling panic over the `` flying pig '' flu . 
If the mortality rate was over 2 % it would be a the most serious form of pandemic for which the WHO recommends draconian action such as closing national boarders . 
In publishing this incorrect information , you are saying that `` flying pig '' flu is already much , much worse than 1918 Spanish flu !!!!! As for a 98 % mortality from seasonal flu for those over 65 what utter crap . 
This whole affair is revealing how scientifically and mathematically challenged journalists actually are . 
We cant give all the blaim to the reporters , they only report what they are told . 
There is hardly any concrete investigative reporting these days due to time restraints . 
We all tend to lean on what is told is the supposedly truth , which is in many cases far from it . 
Look at how far this global warming issue has gone . 
Although we all agree that the problem is real , no one truely understands its cause and direction . . 
There are less deaths from H1 N1 then from the ordinary flu that goes around every year . 
It is anything but a pandemic . 
I am not sure why Who has called it a pandemic and it seem the rest of their numbers are off the charts as well . 
I have ever only had a flu shot once and after I was horribly sick . 
The only reason I decided to get it was I was working with a large group of people . 
I am sorry I did get the bloody thing . 
Other then that I have never had one and have never gotten the flu and if I did it was so mild one would n't even have noticed . 
The most I have ever really had is a mild cold . 
Everbody needs to back off with the `` journalists are horrible '' comments and look at the graphs again . 
The estimated rates are NOT actual rates . 
These are based upon the latest data and then projected , like any other probability . 
Also , I totally agree with Judy H. Remember , not every country in the world has a viable , working health surveillance system . 
It is guaranteed that there are more cases out there that we do n't know about . 
I would n't be surprised if there was a HIGHER mortality rate in certain populations . 
Also , p emery is absolutely correct . 
We have n't seen the full impact of this current outbreak yet . 
We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

2009-06-12,"\* WTO protectionism report to highlight swine flu pork bans \* Report timed to appear before OECD ministerial meeting \* `` Steady drip '' of measures continues GENEVA , June 12 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Bans on pork imports after the swine flu outbreak will be highlighted in the World Trade Organisation 's -LRB- WTO -RRB- report on protectionism due in the coming weeks , trade sources said on Friday . 
But overall the report will not show any dramatic upsurge in protectionism as the economic crisis grinds on , rather a `` steady drip '' of trade measures , one source said . 
The WTO will be putting the finishing touches to its regular trade measures report ahead of the June 23-24 ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- in Paris , the sources said . 
The OECD annual meeting regularly devotes some time to trade , and will be attended by WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy . 
`` If we can get it finished by then we will , '' said one source , adding that otherwise Lamy would take the details with him to Paris to brief trade ministers . 
Of 80 countries implementing measures affecting trade since March 1 , 50 did so because of swine flu , the source said . 
`` We 're going to have a box on swine flu , '' the source said . 
The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- declared on Thursday that the outbreak of swine flu , officially known as influenza -LRB- A -RRB- H1N1 , was a pandemic , meaning it would spread all over the world and could not be contained . 
-LRB- ID : nNLB765857 -RRB- It repeated that it did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions as a result . 
Many countries banned imports of pork from Mexico , the United States and other countries after the outbreak was detected in April . 
Lamy has joined the WHO , World Organisation for Animal Health -LRB- OIE -RRB- and U.N. 's Food and Agriculture Organisation in stating that pork is not a source of infection and is safe to eat provided it is prepared properly . 
But the forthcoming WTO report is likely to limit itself to listing the meat import restrictions and not comment on whether they are justified , for fear of prejudging any trade disputes that arise from them . 
Non-WTO member Russia is one of the most prominent countries banning pork imports from affected countries , and together with Argentina will again appear as one of the countries most actively restricting imports , the sources said . 
Other highlights of the report will be the resumption of dairy export subsidies by the United States and the introduction this week of extra tariffs on certain steel products by Brazil . 
Figures issued this week showed that Brazil is in recession after a smaller-than-expected fall in gross domestic product in the first quarter following a contraction in the fourth quarter . 
-LRB- ID : nN09366113 -RRB- The WTO report will also examine the impact of financial bailouts , technical barriers to trade , and anti-dumping and safeguards -- measures allowed under WTO rules to tackle unfairly priced imports or destabilising import surges . 
The number of anti-dumping cases rose sharply last year , a WTO report showed . 
-LRB- ID : nL71001475 -RRB- The WTO issued a first trade measures report in January , after November 's pledge by the G20 group of rich and emerging countries not to aggravate the economic crisis by restricting trade . 
A second report followed at the end of March shortly before the G20 summit in London . 
The World Bank has also been tracking protectionist moves , and on Monday the British government launched a website www.globaltradealert.org to provide live updates on protectionism .

2009-06-12,"RABAT , June 12 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Morocco has confirmed its first case of the H1N1 flu virus in a 18-year-old woman who had returned home from studying at a university in Canada , the North African country 's health ministry said on Friday . 
The woman arrived on Wednesday at her home city of Fes on board a Royal Air Maroc flight via Casablanca from Montreal and showed the first symptoms , the ministry added in a statement . 
`` Results of -LRB- laboratory exams of a sample -RRB- have confirmed the existence of AH1N1 virus on the young woman , whose state of health is currently stable , '' the ministry said . 
Authorities were providing the required health care to the woman 's family and checking whether any of the passengers who were on the flights Montreal-Casablanca and Casablanca-Fes might be infected by the virus . 
`` Since the outbreak abroad of the virus , Morocco has established a surveillance system and strengthened the surveillance of passengers boarding flights from countries with AH1N1 pandemics , '' the ministry said .

2009-06-12,"ZURICH | Fri Jun 12 , 2009 4:45 pm EDT ZURICH -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Novartis AG expects a vaccine for the H1N1 virus , the source of the first flu pandemic for 40 years , to be available by the autumn after it produced the first batch for testing ahead of schedule . 
Meanwhile , U.S. company Baxter International Inc said it is in full-scale production of an A\/H1N1 flu pandemic vaccine that could be ready for commercial use as early as next month . 
The Baxter and Novartis vaccines were both developed using cell-based technology that could allow for much more rapid production and distribution than traditional vaccines produced using chicken eggs . 
The Novartis vaccine will enter clinical trials next month , the Swiss drugmaker said on Friday , a day after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic and warned governments to prepare for a long battle against the virus . 
Baxter said it had completed testing and evaluation of the virus and would submit its A\/H1N1 vaccine for approval upon completion of initial manufacturing runs . 
European drugmakers Novartis , Sanofi-Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline and Solvay all obtained the influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- seed virus in recent weeks and aim to have a vaccine ready ahead of the northern hemisphere flu season . 
The WHO has estimated vaccine makers could produce up to 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots a year in a best-case scenario , leaving some of the world 's 6.5 billion population unprotected , particularly if more than one injection was needed to gain immunity . 
Novartis said first results with the H1N1 wild type strain showed it was quicker to make the vaccine through cell-based rather than through egg-based production , and it had completed its first batch weeks earlier than expected . 
Its cell-culture vaccine plant in Marburg , Germany had the potential to produce millions of doses per week , but it was difficult to predict output capacity for now . 
Spokesman Eric Althoff said Novartis should have the vaccine ready in September or October . 
He was unsure if other companies had completed the first stage of the production process . 
Glaxo said Friday it would be able to meet advance purchase commitments for 150 to 180 million doses , and the 50 million it donated to the WHO for developing countries . 
Wayne Pisano , head of vaccines at Sanofi , the world 's largest flu vaccine supplier , said on Thursday his company would `` produce the largest number of doses of vaccine in the shortest time frame , '' though it would be another four months before the first supply of bulk concentrate was ready . 
Novartis shares closed up 4.4 percent , while Baxter shares were up 3.5 percent . 
The H1N1 strain has spread widely , with 28,774 infections confirmed in 74 countries to date , including 144 deaths , according to the WHO 's latest tally . 
Although the strain seems mild at present , health officials are worried it might return in a more virulent form in the northern hemisphere winter . 
While commercial production of vaccines usually depends on how easily a virus strain grows in chicken eggs , Novartis said its cell-based technology means it can produce a vaccine without having to adapt the virus strain to grow in eggs . 
`` The cell-based manufacturing puts Novartis at the forefront of supplying pandemic vaccines to governments around the world , '' said Helvea analyst Karl-Heinz Koch . 
A number of national public health authorities have agreements with Baxter that allow them to place orders for its vaccine now that a pandemic has been declared by WHO , Baxter said . 
Novartis said more than 30 governments have made requests for vaccine ingredients , combining preexisting pandemic vaccine supply agreements and new requests for vaccines across all production platforms . 
The H1N1 flu outbreak is the first to be declared a pandemic since 1968 , and WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said on Thursday different regulatory authorities needed to work together to speed registration of a safe vaccine . 
The question of how the vaccine would be dispensed was still open , Novartis ' Althoff said . 
`` This will depend on government programs and what health authorities , the WHO and others say on how they want to make it available , '' he said .

2009-06-13,"2009 06 13 00:11 JST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic on Thursday and advised governments to prepare for a long-term battle against an unstoppable new flu virus . 
The United Nations agency raised its pandemic flu alert to phase 6 on a six-point scale , indicating the first influenza pandemic since 1968 is under way . 
`` With today 's announcement , WHO moves from an emergency to a longer-term response . 
Based on past experience , this pandemic will be with us for some months , if not years , to come , '' WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said in a letter to staff , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters . 
People aged 30-50 , pregnant women or people suffering from chronic conditions such as asthma , diabetes or obesity are at highest risk , Chan told a news conference . 
The virus has killed 109 people in Mexico , where it was first detected in April before spreading to the rest of the world , prompting the Mexican government to temporarily shut schools and businesses in an effort to slow its spread . 
Countries from Australia to Chile to the United States are reporting that the new swine flu virus is `` crowding out '' seasonal flu , becoming the predominant influenza strain , she said . 
For now the virus was `` pretty stable , '' but Chan warned that it could still change into a more deadly form , perhaps mixing with the H5N1 bird flu virus circulating widely in poultry . 
"
2009-06-14,"First death of swine flu patient in UK For the first time in Britain , a patient suffering from swine flu has died . 
The Scottish government has confirmed that the patient had underlying health issues . 
Scotland 's Health Secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , called the death `` tragic '' but emphasised that the risk to the public from the H1N1 virus was still low . 
The BBC 's Lorna Gordon reports from Glasgow . 
"
2009-06-14,"Swine flu is officially a pandemic . 
But do n't worry ... not yet , anyway Out of 30,000 global cases , only 145 deaths have been reported and development of a vaccine is well under way . 
But scientists will not relax : the virus could mutate and grow stronger over the summer - and what happens if it mixes with bird flu ? 
It was the final surge in numbers that forced the World Health Organisation to act . 
With confirmation last week that swine flu cases had risen above 1,000 in Australia , it was clear the disease was now spreading freely around the world . 
Thousands of cases had already been reported in the United States , Mexico and Chile . 
Officials at the World Health Organisation simply had no choice . 
On Thursday , they announced swine flu had achieved pandemic status , the first strain of influenza to reach this mark for 41 years . 
It seems an alarming prospect . 
Are we again set to face a disease that can kill millions as happened with the pandemics of 1918 , 1957 and 1968 ? 
Margaret Chan , the World Health Organisation 's director general , was confident , however . 
The disease is only a `` moderately severe '' risk , she announced . 
Out of 30,000 cases worldwide , only 145 deaths have been reported . 
Development of a vaccine - the world 's main anti-flu weapon - is already under way while stockpiles of anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu are also available , at least for developed nations . 
It would be premature to assume complete security , however . 
Before the world vanquishes swine flu , many hurdles will have to be cleared . 
In particular , every stage of the development of a swine flu vaccine , our key hope of fighting the disease , could be disrupted , scientists warned last week . 
`` We must be prepared for something that is more severe than is currently observed , '' said Dr Alan Hay , director of the World Influenza Centre , in London . 
`` We can not be complacent . '' 
For a start , swine flu vaccine production is still at a very early stage . 
Indeed , the artificial strain that will form the core of a vaccine has only just been created , with researchers in Britain , Australia and the US having produced almost identical versions . 
These have only just been passed to pharmaceutical firms to see if they can quickly produce the vaccine on a mass scale . 
The British version of the vaccine strain - known as RG121 - was created two weeks ago at the National Institute for Biological Standards Control near London . 
Like its US and Australian counterparts , it is made of bits of several flu viruses but specifically stimulates immunity against swine flu . 
Unlike swine flu , however , it can be grown easily in hens ' eggs . 
Eggs are used throughout the drugs industry as incubators in which viruses - the basic components of vaccines - are grown . 
`` Hens ' eggs remain the bulwark for vaccine production , '' said Professor Peter Dunnill , of the Centre for Biochemical Engineering at University College London . 
`` It is a pretty ponderous business , however . 
Each egg has to be looked after carefully and you have to beware lest infections kill them off . '' 
This point was backed by Dr James Robertson , leader of the team that created the RG121 strain . 
`` Different strains behave differently in eggs and produce varying amounts of virus particles . 
In the case of our swine flu vaccine strain , we simply do not know yet how much virus you will get from each egg , At present , pharmaceutical companies ' estimates of the amounts of virus particles they will get from their eggs are optimistic . 
This could be a mistake , warn scientists , and companies could find they get less than a third or a quarter as many viral particles as they hoped for , a reduction that would , in turn , limit the number of vaccine doses available to the public . 
Once viruses are extracted from eggs they are broken into pieces including bits of their protein coats . 
These protein pieces are important because they stimulate immune responses in humans and can be used to make a vaccine . 
`` Coat proteins raise antibodies in the blood so that a person , coming across the real live virus , will be prepared to launch an immune attack against it , '' said Robertson . 
But sometimes , it takes more than one dose of a vaccine to stimulate full protection . 
The current seasonal flu vaccine requires only a single shot but other vaccines require two inoculations , a point stressed by Dr Hay . 
`` It may require two doses to provide significant immunity against swine flu , '' he told the Observer . 
And if a swine flu vaccine requires a double dose , this would also limit numbers of doses available to provide full protection as quickly as possible . 
Even if viral production in eggs goes to plan , manufacturers such as GlaxoSmithKline will be stretched to meet demands and have decided to add chemicals known as adjuvants to their vaccines . 
Adjuvants stimulate immune systems and so reduce amounts of vaccine needed to create antibody protection in an individual . 
`` We will be using adjuvants in our vaccines , '' said Stephen Rae of GlaxoSmithKline . 
`` This will be the first time we have used them for a flu vaccine but we are confident they will work . '' 
However , Professor Dunnill again warned that care should be taken with such predictions . 
`` It remains to be seen if pharmaceuticals can rely on using adjuvants and still produce a single dose vaccine against swine flu , '' he said . 
And then there is the issue of timing . 
At present , only a limited number of people have succumbed to swine flu in the UK with the Health Protection Agency putting the figure at 1,121 confirmed cases yesterday . 
But most scientists now predict a second wave of the disease is likely to strike later in the year . 
Exactly when and how it hits will have profound consequences for Britain , as Hay explained . 
`` The key issue is how the virus mutates in the southern hemisphere over the next few months during the winter there . 
That is far more important than its behavior in the northern hemisphere during our spring and summer . '' 
The virus is more likely to spread through populations during the southern hemisphere in winter and the more it does so , the more it is likely to mutate , possibly into a new , more virulent form . 
There is also the issue of the timing of that return . 
If a reinvigorated , more virulent forms appears late in the year , health and pharmaceutical workers could have enough time to prepare reasonable supplies of vaccine . 
`` However , if it returns earlier in the year , in September , say , there is not much chance we will have enough vaccine ready by then , '' Dr Hay warned . 
`` It is undoubtedly a problem . 
Certainly , there is no doubt the big issue here is time . '' 
Should vaccine supplies be low when the second wave strikes , health workers will then face a problem of deciding which members of the public should be rated as priority targets . 
Health and utility workers , police and security staff , will be obvious choices . 
But selecting the elderly - a key choice for seasonal flu vaccine - as priorities for swine flu vaccines would be a mistake , Hay said . 
`` Around 75 per cent of people who have succumbed to swine flu have been under age of 30 and very few have been over 60 . 
It is very likely that people of 60 and above may well have some immunity . '' 
Intriguingly swine flu is of the same basic type , called H1N1 , as the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic , the world 's worst outbreak of flu which killed up to 100 million people across the globe . 
`` That basic strain circulated round the world for another four decades until 1957 when it was replaced by a new type , known as H2N2 , which was responsible for the Asian flu epidemic of that year , '' Hay said . 
In other words , people who were children or young adults before 1957 may well be carrying immune protection to an old virus that is a distant descendant of the 1918 flu strain and which is giving them protection against swine flu . 
Hence the relatively robust response of those over 60 to the current pandemic - though these individuals will still need protection from standard seasonal flu with vaccines that are now being stockpiled by pharmaceutical firms . 
Vaccines are not our only protection against flu , of course . 
Anti-viral drugs - in particular , Tamiflu - block the spread of the flu virus between cells in the body and offer another line of defense against the disease . 
`` Vaccines are our real hope but there is no doubt Tamiflu will help , '' said Dunnill . 
`` But we should note resistance to the drug is spreading . 
The normal seasonal flu virus has acquired Tamiflu resistance over the past year and we will have to monitor , very carefully , how swine flu behaves . 
We can not take the drug for granted , that is certain . '' 
And finally scientists point to the disturbing scenario in which swine flu spreads to countries such as Indonesia and infects animals or humans who are already affected by bird flu . 
The latter disease is difficult to acquire but is highly virulent if caught . 
By contrast , swine flu is easy to pass on although , at present , it rarely produces serious symptoms . 
In a person who becomes infected by both strains , however , it is possible that there will be an exchange of genetic material resulting in the creation of an easily transmissible but highly virulent virus . 
`` It is a nightmare vision which , fortunately , remains only a remote prospect at present , '' said Dunnill . 
All these issues make it difficult for doctors and scientists to be certain how they will cope if swine flu , as expected , returns to Britain with renewed vigor later this year . 
Or it may return in a relatively non-virulent form and pharmaceutical companies may suffer no vaccine production problems . 
Alternatively , things could go wrong . 
`` We can anticipate many things and that , in the end , is all we can do , '' said Hay . 
`` We must prepare as best we can for all these scenarios and then deal with the ones that unfold . 
It will probably be a long battle , however . ''

2009-06-15,"First UK swine flu patient death Prof. John Oxford : `` We are preparing for a more severe outbreak in Autumn '' The swine flu virus has claimed its first victim in the UK , after a female patient died in a Scottish hospital . 
The victim is understood to be a woman aged 38 who gave birth prematurely while being treated at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley . 
The death is the first outside the Americas , where more than 140 people have died since the pandemic began . 
Swine flu has now infected almost 500 people in Scotland alone , out of 1,261 cases in the UK . 
The patient was one of 10 people being treated for swine flu in the greater Glasgow area . 
A statement issued by the Scottish Government said : `` With regret , we can confirm that one of the patients who had been in hospital , and had been confirmed as suffering from the H1N1 virus , has died today . 
`` The patient had underlying health conditions . '' 
It 's worth remembering that seasonal flu kills several thousand people in the UK each winter Fergus Walsh , BBC medical correspondent Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said : `` I 'd like to express my condolences to the patient 's family and friends . 
This is a tragedy for those concerned and they have my heartfelt sympathy . 
`` Tragic though today 's death is , I would like to emphasise that the vast majority of those who have H1N1 are suffering from relatively mild symptoms . '' 
The BBC 's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh said : `` Swine flu does present a slightly higher risk to those with existing respiratory illness , asthma , cardiovascular disease and obesity . '' 
He added : `` It 's worth remembering that seasonal flu kills several thousand people in the UK each winter . 
The difference with H1N1 swine flu is that the virus is almost exclusively targeting people under 65 . '' 
Thirty-five new cases of swine flu in Scotland were confirmed on Sunday . 
Together with 61 new cases in England and one case in Northern Ireland confirmed on Sunday , a total of 1,261 people have now caught the virus in the UK . 
Another 486 possible UK cases are being investigated . 
Virologist Professor John Oxford said that despite the death , the public should not panic . 
`` I still think the chances of picking up the virus are remote . 
It is not going to get any worse during the summer . '' 
Professor Oxford said he did not think the the public had become complacent and said the country was well prepared in terms of anti-viral drugs . 
The UK government outlined measures it has taken to combat the outbreak earlier this week . 
Ministers urged people not to alter their normal behavior and follow hand hygiene guidelines . 
"
2009-06-15,"Fergus Walsh | 10:25 UK time , Monday , 15 June 2009 I 'm going to talk here about the risks associated with getting H1N1 swine flu during pregnancy . 
Although it 's not been officially confirmed , it 's understood that the first person with H1N1 swine flu to die in Britain was a 38-year-old mother who had given birth prematurely . 
The patient , who has not yet been named , was admitted to hospital with swine flu and gave birth earlier this month to a premature baby . 
The child was born at 29 weeks gestation . 
Few details have yet been confirmed by the Scottish authorities ; they have so far said only that the patient had `` underlying health conditions '' . 
Her death is very sad news , and everyone 's thoughts must be with her family , friends and the medical staff who cared for her . 
Before I go on to discuss the elevated risks of swine flu associated with pregnancy , it 's important to stress , as I do repeatedly , that the vast majority of people who contract this virus have a mild disease which lasts a few days . 
Many will have no symptoms at all . 
The official figure for the UK is 1,261 cases and this is the first death . 
But there will have been hundreds - maybe many thousands - of cases which have gone unrecorded . 
So instead of being one death in 1,261 cases , it is undoubtedly a lot less than that . 
With around 700,000 babies born in the UK each year , I know that many women and their partners will be concerned . 
So please be reassured that the vast majority of pregnant women who get infected will be okay , as will their unborn children . 
Having put all those caveats in place , it is true that pregnancy is a risk factor for swine flu . 
The director general of the World Health Organization , Margaret Chan , had this to say about pregnancy last week , in her speech declaring a flu pandemic : `` Without question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . 
This heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' 
But remember that pregnancy is also a risk factor for seasonal flu , especially in the last trimester . 
Flu poses a threat both to the mother and to the unborn child . 
Among the complications , the fever associated with flu can lead to a premature delivery . 
Health advisers recommended three years ago that pregnant women should be among the groups offered a seasonal flu jab . 
When a vaccine for H1N1 swine flu becomes available in the autumn , pregnant women may well be among the first `` at risk '' groups offered the jab . 
What about antiviral drugs and pregnancy ? 
During pregnancy , the concern with any drug is that it may pass through the placenta and affect the baby . 
There is a risk factor especially during the first trimester . 
Oseltamivir -LRB- currently best known as the brand name Tamiflu -RRB- is not usually recommended for pregnant women because the side-effects are unknown . 
But the lesser-known inhaled drug Relenza -LRB- a brand name for zanamivir -RRB- can be prescribed on medical advice , according to the Department of Health . 
`` An expert group reviewed the risk of antiviral treatment in pregnancy , which is extremely small - much smaller than the risk posed by the symptoms of swine flu . '' 
There are more details on pregnancy and swine flu on the government health pages . 
At 11:07 am on 15 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Give pregnant women massive priority . 
The health authorities are dealing with two people , not one . 
Pregnancy and childbirth is a high risk time all of the time . 
If it is unwise to give certain antiviral drugs to pregnant women then it stands to reason , to reduce unnecessary contact with the rest of us until such time as the baby is born . 
We can reduce the risk to pregnant mums by keeping well away if we have been in contact with or have this new flu . 
Shopping for food online is a bit safer than the weekly scrum in the supermarket . 
Get someone else to do the supermarket run . 
Anti natal appointments could be run from an alternative location away from the germ ridden doctors surgery . 
Luckily , most hospitals for childbirth are set apart from the general hospitals . 
Home deliveries are risky at the best of times and should not be an alternative for safe hospital delivery , where specialists are always at hand . 
Pregnant mums may already have a toddler at the local nursery , playgroup or school . 
Other mums could reduce the risk of flu contact , by making sure their own children do not have symptoms of flu or other infectious diseases before sending them of to school each morning . 
It only takes two minutes to check a temperature . 
Schools and nurseries could be more pro-active and less politically correct and simply refuse to allow a child to attend if they are obviously ill . 
The temptation will be , to allow a child back to nursery before the child has got over the infectious stage , if the child appears apparently well . 
Do n't forget , if you knowingly take risks , you risk the health of others . 
That 's the first time - as far as I 'm aware - that anyone from government , or any journalist , has actually admitted that there may well be a significant difference between the ` official ' figure and the real figure of infections . 
Now , as has already been stated on these blogs , the official figure is the number of reported and confirmed cases - and it may be relevant to consider that some , perhaps even many , of these persons have recovered from the infection and would no longer be an infection risk to others . 
So in terms of people assessing how likely it is that they will come into direct or indirect contact with an infectious person and thereby risk becoming infected - these figures are particularly useless in many respects . 
And is n't that really what people want some idea about ? 
The risk to them ? 
In fact , I almost wonder why the government is bothering to constantly publish these figures and the media report them ! 
At 3:04 pm on 15 Jun 2009 , 32weeks wrote : Well , not even all newspapers today mentioned that the woman was pregnant when she contracted the virus , let alone that she gave birth to premature baby before passing away days later . 
There is very little information about the virus and pregnant women in general , and I notice that even though there is a lot of data already collected by WHO about the cases -LRB- and disproportinately high number of cases involving pregnant women -RRB- the official documents regarding the virus have not been updated since they were first issued . 
It is appalling that only with the first lethal case some more information is siphoning through the media , though barely adequate . 
Here is an idea to chew on . 
A mad , random , scientific idea is that bacteria make the rain fall . 
The info is on the BBC site today and is on radio 4 tonight at 9 pm . 
As a child , when it rained , I was always told to wear a rain mac , dry my hair thoroughly , take an umbrella with me or I ` would catch my death of cold ' if I got wet in the rain . 
It always used to puzzle me because the same restrictions were not in place when I went to the beach and enjoyed bathing in the sea . 
Are viruses able to temporarily host on the bacteria that ` seed ' the rain and possibly make rain fall ? 
It is interesting , because if bacteria can alter the temperature that rain freezes , then it might explain why antifreeze works or why salt prevents water freezing at zero . 
The bacteria are being killed or attenuated by the salt and alcohol . 
Fergus , I would echo Sutara 's comment above . 
Far more relevant than the historic number of recorded cases is the number of recent cases within any geography . 
It may be , for example , that H1N1 has practically died out in some regions or countries that have previously reported cases , but we the public , ca n't tell . 
Could the BBC please issue a revised map of cases within the past 10 days , or some medically relevant period ? 
It ca n't be that difficult to produce based on the statistics published already . 
At 07:56 am on 16 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : The double tragedy has moved me to tears this morning . 
My deepest condolences for the family and friends . 
At the end of the day , people matter , not maps , not numbers , not who is right and who is wrong , just people . 
I completely agree that this family now has to try to come to terms with an especially tragic situation , at a time when they expected to be celebrating the baby 's arrival home . 
And it is because people matter that many just want some clear idea about the risks involved , presented to them in a straight-forward way , neither hyped up , nor dumbed down . 
In the final analysis most people want to be self-determining and want the information so that they themselves can `` manage '' the risks involved to the best of their ability . 
Unfortunately , probably for a whole number of reasons including the operational cultures of Health Trusts and civil servants , the information being published is n't actually particularly helpful to the metaphorical man on the Clapham omnibus . 
People do n't want `` command and control '' from the authorities , they just want clear useful informaton . 
At 08:37 am on 16 Jun 2009 , Sutara wrote : Additionally , they want to understand basic things like how long people are infectious for , so that they do n't accidentally endanger themselves or those near and dear to them - especially if that would involve anyone from a ` high-risk ' group . 
You know , most of the decision-making that will make most difference to managing this outbreak , wo n't be done by doctors , nurses , or a government Health Secretary , it will be done by ordinary people in homes , offices , shops , etc. , up and down the country . 
At risk of sounding cynical , the authorities have lost control of this infection , so it 's time to empower the ordinary people to deal with it the best they can . 
At 10:13 am on 16 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Sutara , I understand your concern about incubation and infection times . 
I am not an expert on this matter but I have information about flu types in general . 
My information is from a published source , not intended for the general public but for health agency workers in the field . 
Normal flu has an incubation time of about 2 days which can stretch out from 1-4 days . 
A new flu like H1N1 may behave differently and could range from 2-5 days , possibly 8 , who knows ? 
Infection time for normal flu is up to 5 days in adults and stretching out to about 10 days in children . 
Again , this is all depending on circumstances . 
It has been known for flu to last from 2-3 weeks , but that would be an exception and not the rule . 
How do you package that information into a sensible format that is not overreactive , straight forward and does n't confuse or alarm people ? 
Being overcautious is as harmful as not cautious enough ! 
We all have to interact with each other and continue normal lives . 
The economy is dependent on our ability to make sensible decisions and be available for work . 
A good piece of advice would to maintain a social distance of 1 meter wherever possible . 
The flu virus has difficulty infecting you at a further distance . 
Masks are suitable only for preventing your sneeze mixture of bodily excretion and virus , expelling out and jumping the 1 meter distance to infect someone else . 
A clearer idea of incubation time and infection time for H1N1 may be coming out of America where they would have been busy gathering statistics to plan for future outbreaks . 
I reckon it 's quite easy - you find a term , say ` stimated current infection rate ' . 
Based on the reported positive cases and when they were reported , you publish a figure , country by county in the UK , of the estimated current percentage of the population who are currently infected , perhaps that would be those whose infection was between 1 and 10 days old . 
You provide a simple explanation of the figure , clarify that it is n't written in ` tables of stone ' , and that it needs to be regarded as indicative only . 
Even if someone says their flu started last Monday , when it really started last Tuesday , it does n't matter as you work on the basis that such errors will either cancel out or have a fairly consistent effect on the figure . 
So you might then end up with a figure for Scotland of say 0.01 % , one for England of whatever , etc. . 
Whoops - that should have been ` estimated current infection rate ' . 
Unfortunately it 's not quite that simple . 
New cases reported on a particular day are really the cases that were confirmed in lab tests from the day -LRB- or night ? -RRB- 
The swabs for the tests would have been taken from patients presented to a doctor or nurse -LRB- for testing -RRB- at some point from say 12 hours prior to up to 48 hours , possibly more , before . 
How long depends on how fast the labs work , how long it takes for samples to reach them and be performed . 
Also , suspected cases will have been swabbed at different points in their infection . 
The cases that the postitive tests refer to could have started their infections anything from the day before to up to 7 days previously -LRB- assuming it took them 5 days to be tested and 3 days for test to run and processed -RRB- , possibly longer ago . 
There is also natural variation in how long incubation and infectious periods last in different people , even for a short lived infections like flu ; the upper and lower limits of these periods are still uncertain for the new H1N1 flu strain . 
So to calculate when confirmed cases first became ill accurately you need to know several processes with high precision , and mostly these are unknown currently . 
Frustrating , but that 's the trouble with asking good , tricky to answer questions ! 
Of course , one could always ask the cases themselves when they first got symptoms , which I 'm sure has been done by the HPA and other .

One minute it 's ok the next minute you have to be worried for one reason or another and never quite know what to believe .

Bacterial pneumonia can be succesfully prevented by prophylactic antibiotic administration . 
I think it would be wise for GPs to prescribe antibiotics for the high risk groups even if it is not active on the virus but it would prevent the most feared complication , bacterial pneumonia . 
In my opinion , in our century , nobody should die of bacterial pneumonia , regardless of the underlying health problems , because even if it is sometimes difficult to treat , especially when the medication is administered in an advanced stage of the disease , prevention is a very simple , handy and efficient measure which could save the life of many people . 
Because , let 's face it : how many of us can say that they do n't fall in any risk category ?

2009-06-15,"Ms Fleming had health problems before contracting the flu virus The family of the first person in Europe to die after being diagnosed with swine flu has suffered a double tragedy with the death of her baby . 
Jacqueline Fleming , 38 , from Glasgow , died on Sunday at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley . 
Her son Jack , who was born 11 weeks early , died on Monday in a special care baby unit at the same hospital . 
The baby was not infected with the Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus . 
He was two weeks old when he died . 
Ms Fleming had been suffering from underlying health problems since the birth of her son . 
In a statement , her partner William McCann said it was an extremely distressing and difficult time for the family . 
He said : `` My beautiful son was born on the first of June 2009 , 11 weeks early . 
`` He suffered from a number of complications and despite his brave fight he passed away earlier this evening at the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley . '' 
She was a really nice lady , really kind , a quiet woman , just a family person really Ms Fleming lived with her two other children - one aged 18 and one of primary school age - and her long-term partner in the family home in Thornliebank , just south of Glasgow . 
William Docherty , who knew Ms Fleming , told BBC Scotland he believed she had been admitted to hospital following a stroke . 
A female friend of the family said : `` I think they are taking it really badly . 
She was in hospital for a couple of weeks and there were days she was getting better and days she was taking a turn for the worse . 
`` They hoped she was going to pull through and it was a shock when she died . 
The family are really devastated . '' 
She added : `` She was a really nice lady , really kind , a quiet woman , just a family person really . '' 
Scotland Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said : `` The death of baby Jack , especially coming so soon after the death of his mother , is a tragedy and I extend my deepest condolences to their family and friends for this unimaginably painful loss . '' 
The Scottish Government said Scotland had no new laboratory confirmed cases of swine flu . 
However , GPs in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area are now , in certain circumstances , diagnosing patients on the basis of clinical symptoms alone - without laboratory confirmation . 
There had been 71 such diagnoses , the government said . 
Scotland therefore currently has 498 confirmed cases , plus 71 which have been clinically diagnosed . 
Jacqueline Fleming lived in Crebar Street in the Thornliebank area In England , the Health Protection Agency said another 59 cases had been confirmed . 
Earlier , Ms Sturgeon said that while Ms Fleming 's death was tragic the public should take some reassurance from the fact that most cases of the virus were `` relatively mild '' . 
She said : `` It is important to stress that in any flu outbreak , unfortunately , we will see a small number of deaths and that does n't change the fact that for the vast majority of people contracting this virus the symptoms are relatively mild . ''

2009-06-15,"Family devastated by death of Scottish swine flu victim The prematurely born son of Jacqui Fleming , the mother who died yesterday from swine flu , has also died tonight The Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley , Scotland . 
Photograph : David Moir\/Reuters The family of the first British swine flu patient to die said today they were `` absolutely devastated '' as health experts tried to allay public fears about the virulence of the virus . 
Jacqui Fleming , 38 , from Carnwadric in south Glasgow , was named today as the first person outside the Americas to have died since the H1N1 virus first emerged in Mexico more than three months ago . 
Fleming had underlying health problems , and died in intensive care at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley on Sunday , two weeks after giving birth prematurely to her third child . 
The birth was induced nearly three months early because of her critical condition . 
NHS Greater Glasgow said tonight that her son , named Jack , also died today . 
An NHS spokesman said the baby did not die from swine flu . 
A statement issued on behalf of Ms Fleming 's partner William McCann , said : `` My beautiful son was born on 1st June 2009 , 11 weeks early . 
`` He suffered from a number of complications and despite his brave fight he passed away earlier this evening at the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley . 
`` Coming so soon after the death of his mum , this is an extremely distressing and difficult time for our family and I would ask the media to respect our privacy as we try to cope with the loss of Jacqueline and Jack . '' 
A statement from NHS Greater Glasgow said : `` Earlier this evening , baby Jack , the son of Jacqueline Fleming and her partner William McCann , tragically passed away . '' 
She leaves two other children , one boy aged 18 and another at primary school . 
Her family said : `` Our whole family is absolutely devastated and we are doing everything we can to support Jacqueline 's two sons and her partner . 
`` Jacqueline has been ill in hospital for a number of weeks but nothing can prepare you for such shattering news . '' 
Alex Salmond , the Scottish secretary , and Nicola Sturgeon , the Scottish health secretary , were joined by Ed Balls , the UK government 's children , schools and families secretary , in sending the family condolences . 
A family friend said the death was a tragedy . 
`` I think they are taking it really badly , '' she said . 
`` They hoped she was going to pull through and it was a shock when she died . 
She was a really nice lady , really kind , a quiet woman , just a family person really . '' 
Fleming was one of 10 people in hospital with swine flu in Scotland , where hospitalisation rates are the same as in the United States , the second worst affected country . 
The total UK figure jumped to 1,320 today , with a further 59 cases in England , chiefly in the West Midlands . 
However , Sir Liam Donaldson , the chief medical officer for England and Wales , said the virus was causing very few illnesses compared with normal seasonal flu viruses , although a `` large surge '' in numbers was likely this autumn . 
With more than 30,000 people affected worldwide , the World Health Organisation reported last Friday that only 145 had died . 
Pregnant women were more vulnerable to this particular virus , Donaldson added . 
`` If we look at the pattern of this illness worldwide , generally for most people it has n't been a severe illness , '' he said . 
`` In a bad seasonal flu winter we would get between 400,000 to 500,000 people falling ill with flu . '' 
Professor Hugh Pennington , a bacteriologist at Aberdeen University , said that swine flu deaths were not unexpected . 
`` It does not point to the virus getting nastier . 
All the evidence to date suggests the virus is not changing at all , '' he said . 
`` This is a flu virus , it is in no way different from an ordinary winter flu virus , so if there are enough cases some people will have to be admitted to hospital and some will die . ''

2009-06-15,"HANOI | Mon Jun 15 , 2009 11:45 am EDT HANOI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Many sick passengers who flew to Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam took fever reducers to cheat temperature scanners at the airport , leading to the discovery of several infected cases later , state media reported at the weekend . 
Nguyen Van Chau , head of Ho Chi Minh City 's Health Department , was quoted in state-run Tien Phong -LRB- Vanguard -RRB- daily as saying `` a series of passengers '' took fever reducers three hours before arrival . 
`` That 's why when they passed through the airport , the body temperature scanners skipped them , '' Chau said . 
Vietnam has confirmed 26 people infected with H1N1 flu , 23 of whom came by air after traveling in the United States or Australia . 
Three others fell sick after coming in contact with the infected travelers . 
The country requires inbound passengers found with fever to be isolated for seven days . 
Clinical investigations of the infected cases revealed they had taken fever reducers , Chau said . 
The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- declared an influenza pandemic on Thursday and advised governments to prepare for a long-term battle against the virus . 
The H1N1 strain has spread widely , with 28,774 infections confirmed in 74 countries to date , including 144 deaths , according to the WHO 's latest tally . 
Vietnam has so far had no deaths from the flu .

2009-06-16,"UK swine flu highest in Europe The UK has the highest number of confirmed swine flu cases in Europe An extra 141 cases of swine flu have been confirmed in England , making the UK home to the highest number of confirmed cases in Europe . 
The national total now stands at 1,461 patients since April 2009 . 
This number does not include clinically diagnosed cases in Scotland where the virus has spread particularly fast . 
These are yet to be confirmed . 
At the weekend a 38-year-old Scottish woman became the first victim of the virus outside America . 
Jacqui Fleming from Glasgow had given birth to a premature boy two weeks before her death at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley . 
The baby , named Jack , who also died did not have swine flu . 
In a statement the family said , `` our whole family is absolutely devastated . '' 
Professor Hugh Pennington , a bacteriologist at Aberdeen University , says the death does not indicate that the virus is any more virulent . 
`` It does not point to the virus getting nastier . 
All the evidence to date suggests the virus is not changing at all , '' he said . 
A Department of Health spokesperson said `` The localized cases of swine flu found in the UK have so far been generally mild in most people , but are proving to be severe in a small minority of cases . 
All the evidence to date suggests the virus is not changing at all `` We are continuing to work to slow the spread of the disease and to put in place arrangements to ensure that the UK is well-placed to deal with this new infection . '' 
Last week , the World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- held an emergency meeting at which it declared a global flu pandemic , the first in 40 years . 
A pandemic is declared on geographical terms as the virus spreads , but it does not mean that it is causing more severe illness or a greater number of deaths . 
The swine flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus has now spread to 76 countries after it was first detected in Mexico in April . 
Young working age adults have been the most likely to contract the virus , with a third to a half of complications presenting in otherwise healthy people . 
The government has been stockpiling antivirals like Tamiflu and has ordered vaccine . 
The first doses could be administered in October . 
Anyone suffering from flu-like symptoms is advised to seek medical attention and stay at home .

2009-06-16,"Fergus Walsh | 18:17 UK time , Tuesday , 16 June 2009 Your eyes may glaze over at the thought of graphs . 
But if , like me , you find them useful , then read on . 
I 'm indebted to my colleague Kate Merriam from BBC Research for collating these figures from the World Health Organization website , from the HPA in England and from Health Protection in Scotland . 
Before the numbers , here are some points to bear in mind . 
First , health officials have been charting the spread of H1N1 swine flu for around seven weeks now . 
Most of the cases mentioned will now be virus-free and healthy . 
Second , the WHO figures lag behind the real total by a couple of days . 
For example , the death toll for the US is quite a bit below the current figures from the CDC . 
But the WHO figures , while out of date , are reliable . 
Third , all the graphs vastly underestimate the actual number of cases . 
The CDC has said that perhaps 19 out of 20 cases go unrecorded , and the state of Victoria in Australia has stopped laboratory testing of uncomplex community cases . 
Given those caveats , I think the figures are useful . 
Global H1N1 swine flu cases First , the global tally from the WHO . 
As of 1700 BST on 15 June 2009 , 76 countries have officially reported 35,928 cases of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection , including 163 deaths . 
Now let 's look at some individual countries . 
The number of confirmed cases in the UK now stands at 1,562 . 
There has been one death , that of 38-year-old Jacqueline Fleming , a mother who gave birth prematurely after contracting the virus . 
Yesterday , it was announced that her son Jack had also died . 
He did not have the virus . 
A further 141 patients were confirmed with H1N1 swine flu in England today -LRB- I think this is a record number for one day in England -RRB- , bringing the total to 952 cases . 
Of the new cases in England , 124 appeared in the west Midlands , where 512 people have been affected by the virus . 
There was one new case in Northern Ireland , bringing the total to nine . 
Three cases have been recorded in Wales . 
Health Protection Scotland said there had been 10 new laboratory-confirmed cases today , taking the total to 508 , with 414 possible cases under investigation . 
17,855 cases and 45 deaths at 15 June . 
This represents a rise of 4,638 cases and 18 deaths since the last report on 12 June . 
6,241 cases and 108 deaths with no cases reported in the last three days . 
This can surely only mean that the figures were not forthcoming or that the authorities are not testing in the community . 
I will try to investigate further . 
Yesterday , the US State Department said that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- had lifted the recommendation that American citizens avoid all non-essential travel to Mexico . 
Proving the virus is incredibly mild , just look at the statistics . 
And lets not even mention the CDC saying 19 out of 20 cases go unmissed , its such a weak flu virus right now . 
CDC in new york claim at least half a million cases in NY in may alone . 
Using the recorded deaths in NY gives us a death rate of ... 0.000024 .

At 08:40 am on 17 Jun 2009 , pap1976uk wrote : Lincolnlerner - agree with your point , but it would not be possible to collect that sort of data . 
There is no way of routinely collecting data on how many people are currently suffering . 
Obviously it 's great that at the moment the virus is `` mild '' , but even if it does stay that way , it does n't mean we wo n't have severe problems because of it . 
I feel the biggest issue from a public health perspective is the societal impact of large numbers of people having the virus at the same time . 
It wo n't take much to severely affect health services , not to mention other things we take for granted such as deliveries of food , petrol , and running of transportation systems -LRB- due to staff sickness -RRB- . 
As a resident of Gloucestershire , I know first hand how one event -LRB- flooding in that case -RRB- can have repercussions on the rest of life . 
That 's why the authorities are right to be concerned . 
At 08:43 am on 17 Jun 2009 , pap1976uk wrote : I meant to say , that the only real way of estimating how many people are currently suffering would be to look at the number of recent cases over , say , the past week . 
That would at least give some indication of current sufferers , but it would only be a rough estimate of course .

Now that IS the point , the whole point and nothing but the point . 
People -LRB- except virologists and academics -RRB- are n't particularly interested in how many people had the virus four weeks ago . 
They ARE concerned to try to factor in whatever degree of risk there may be to their interests and functional ability . 
Those interests might be trying to ensure a vulnerable relative is not exposed to the infection , or perhaps business continuity of a company , or local authority , or health trust in the event that the infection rate mushrooms . 
It 's all wrapped up in that term `` societal impact '' . 
At 3:32 pm on 17 Jun 2009 , Greenfrogflyinghigh wrote : I can completely take the point about societal impact and I agree that it would seem to be the real -LRB- economic -RRB- threat in this situation . 
However , I have an axe to grind about the way there seems to be a reaction to this type of flu that is way out of proportion - I mean new strains of viruses are constantly evolving , many far more virulent and dangerous , so why the huge fuss about this one ? 
There are , in fact , far more globally endemic diseases that claim millions of lives annually with far too few proactive resources in place in the countries worst affected . 
I have recently traveled back from the UK to a country in the Far East where I live and work . 
I 'm a community development worker in some of the poorest places in this region . 
Each day , each week , each year I am faced with the effects of preventable diseases that are also curable , yet no treatment is available , no effective strategies in place -LRB- despite apparent millions of dollars of aid -RRB- - TB is foremost in my mind , for instance , though I could name many others . 
Official figures for this country rate TB infection at 70 % . 
In the places I work , those without access to healthcare , our estimate is far higher and people are dying . 
Children are being disabled - yet there is no free medication or treatment program for children and their parents are too ill and too poor to afford drugs . 
Dengue - there 's another one . 
The unacknowledged presence of AIDS which I suspect underlies a large proportion of these fatalities . 
Why do I mention this on a blog on Swine Flu ? 
Well , on my return here last week I was astounded to see the latest technology monitoring body temperatures as we disembarked . 
All of a sudden every public place has sprouted disinfectant dispensers so we can all cleanse our hands . 
The government has produced a flurry of paperwork charting provenance , past travel , contact with foreigners and a part requiring a list of any possible symptoms . 
My daughter , suffering from jet lag , has been ordered to report to a hospital for tests . 
Everywhere there is paranoia and people react in fear if we , as foreigners , so much as sniffle . 
This paranoia is fuelled by posters that proclaim the dangers of Swine Flu - today I read with incredulity the bald , unqualified statement , ` This Disease is Fatal to Humans ' What is going on ?? Has the world gone mad ? 
Why is this such a perceived threat when real killers go untreated ? 
Why ca n't the resources ploughed into preventing such a mild infection be better targeted ? 
I 'm well aware of the devastation that H1N1 could wreak in one of the villages where I work - but the real problem would not be flu , it would be the pre-existing conditions that should have been recognized and dealt with a long time ago . 
Well , this flu is n't that great a threat in many respects , at least not a ` health ' threat . 
But it IS an administrative threat , meaning if civil servants and health experts are n't seen to be recommending and taking the best actions it could leave them open to criticism , or losing their jobs , or being sanctioned for poor performance . 
And it is a political risk . 
And it is a risk , as already suggested , to societal functioning . 
But in the main , it is not really a significant direct threat to most individual 's personal health . 
But you do have to factor in that if societal functioning were to be severely hampered by the effects of a flu outbreak , then the risks to an individual 's well-being and health might increase due to lack of access to medics , pharmacists , transport , etc. , etc. . 
Of course , it is also a journalistic risk . 
If the BBC do n't cover it , Sky or ITV will . 
And the BBC is funded to provide public service information as well as entertainment . 
So that might go some way to answering why there is so much media output about what is probably a comparatively minor risk when compared to some other infections . 
Finally , the number of infected people does have the potential to escalate significantly - whether it actually does that or not - so that is another reason for the quantity of media coverage . 
would suggest that the West Midlands region has had a higher number of reported and confirmed infections than Scotland per captita . 
The West Midlands has a slightly higher population -LRB- about 5.3 million -RRB- compared to Scotland -LRB- about 5.1 million -RRB- . 
But given that the first cases were in Scotland , the rate of spread in the West Midlands would seem to be faster . 
Of course , there could be many other factors in place . 
If , as may be the case , a higher percentage of the West Midlands cases involve children , then the involvement of medics may be more prevalent and , therefore , there may be better reporting and testing of cases .

The experts -LRB- and the Health Service -RRB- are hoping there will be a summer lull in new cases in the Northern Hemisphere with numbers not rising seriously until the Autumn -LRB- when we should have at least some vaccine stocks in place -RRB- . 
But I ca n't really see any sign of that yet . 
It would be interesting to know what the computer models are predicting , and at what point we should see the Northern Hemisphere case rate dropping off for the summer .

We 're almost at 200 now although I 'm sure there could be hundreds more cases that have gone undetected . 
True , we have more cases than most parts of the UK but the one place in England that has more than us , the West Midlands has seen far more cases then London and the same with Scotland . 
Perhaps its due to us being one of the warmest parts of the UK on average and thus the higher temperatures stop it from spreading as well as it would do in colder weather . 
Whatever the reason , it is an interesting thing to ponder . 
Hopefully , things will not increase here to the degree seen in Birmingham or Glasgow . 
At 11:25 pm on 17 Jun 2009 , cumbrianOAP wrote : I did not realize , until recently the great importance of taking advised FULL courses of antibiotics , rather than stop taking them as soon as you feel a little better . 
As this STRENGTHENS the `` BUG 'S '' IMMUNITY TO THE ANTIBIOTIC , HELPING TO BREED SUPER BUGS , which are much , much harder to deal with . 
I think it should be well publicised , and strong warnings of the dangers of not completing full courses of Antibiotics , in Doctors surgery 's and on the Medicine packaging . 
It is , of course , worth pointing out -LRB- for the avoidance of any doubt -RRB- that antibiotics are thoroughly useless in treating flu itself in the normal course of events . 
The only time they would be used is in treating the occasional opportunistic bacterial infections that might arise as a secondary result of flu . 
In the vast majority of cases this does n't happen and antibiotic treatment would be a waste of time . 
The point about finishing the course of a drug is well made though in general terms . 
Notwithstanding rare side effects that make a drug impossible to continue with , it 's important to complete the course of any treatment to prevent resistance and\/or reoccurrence of an illness . 
People should definitely be made aware of the necessity to complete drug treatments according to the correct instructions .

2009-06-16,"India says it is fully equipped to deal with the disease The Indian government is urging people not to travel abroad until swine flu in the country is under control , after seven more people tested positive . 
The new cases come from the Indian city of Jalandhar where a group of students had recently returned from a trip to the US space agency , Nasa . 
The total number of those infected by swine flu throughout India now stands at 30 . 
Last week the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- declared a global flu pandemic . 
The swine flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus first emerged in Mexico in April and has since spread to at least 74 countries . 
Official reports say there have been nearly 30,000 cases globally and 141 deaths , with figures rising daily . 
Doctors in Jalandhar city said the affected students are between 14 and 17 years of age . 
One of them had already tested positive over the weekend . 
They were part of a group of 31 students and three teachers who returned over the weekend after a 10-day educational trip to Nasa in the US . 
Indian officials say they have tracked down eight people who were sitting near the group of students on the flight to Delhi from New York . 
`` They have been advised to watch for flu symptoms and take adequate precautions against possibly spreading the virus , '' an official said . 
Federal health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has urged Indians , especially students , to put off traveling abroad until the flu is under control , the Press Trust of India reported . 
`` Till the disease is controlled globally , I would like to request young people from educational institutions going abroad that they can suspend their visits from the time being , '' he was quoted as saying . 
As well as in Jalandhar , fresh cases of swine flu have also been detected in the southern cities of Hyderabad and Bangalore . 
Earlier this month , India issued an alert against the flu and tightened screening for the virus at airports . 
The government has said India is fully equipped to deal with the outbreak .

2009-06-16,"CAIRO | Tue Jun 16 , 2009 10:20 am EDT CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan authorities have reported an outbreak of bubonic plague in the Mediterranean coastal town of Tubruq , and the World Health Organization was sending a team to investigate , a WHO official said on Tuesday . 
The cases -- approximately 16 to 18 have been reported -- would be the first in more than two decades in Libya of the disease known in medieval times as the Black Death , according to John Jabbour , a Cairo-based emerging diseases specialist at WHO . 
`` It is reported as bubonic plague , '' Jabbour said , adding WHO still did n't have `` a full picture '' of the situation . 
`` It is officially reported by Libya ... Tomorrow , WHO is deploying a mission to Libya to investigate the whole situation , to see how many of the cases are confirmed , or not confirmed . '' 
He said preliminary information from Libyan authorities showed 16 to 18 reported cases including one death , and that Tripoli had asked for assistance from the global health body . 
Bubonic plague , noticeable by black bumps that sometimes develop on victims ' bodies , causes severe vomiting and fever and still kills around 100 to 200 people annually worldwide . 
It can kill within days if not treated with antibiotics . 
A plague epidemic of 1347 to 1351 was one of the deadliest recorded in human history , killing about 75 million people , according to some estimates , including more than a third of Europe 's population . 
That pandemic was thought to have begun in Asia , then spread into the Middle East , Africa and Europe . 
Tubruq , where the new cases were reported , is approximately 125 km from the Egyptian border and was the scene of previous plague cases decades ago , Jabbour said . 
Egypt , already fighting to contain an outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus , said it had no reported cases of plague . 
Rodents carry plague , which is virtually impossible to wipe out and moves through the animal world as a constant threat to humans . 
Globally the World Health Organization reports about 1,000 to 3,000 plague cases each year , with most in the last five years occurring in Madagascar , Tanzania , Mozambique , Malawi , Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo . 
The United States sees about 10 to 20 cases each year .

2009-06-17,"Mr Peres thought the likelihood of H1N1 infecting him was low Israeli President Shimon Peres has been tested for swine flu , after receiving a group of young Jews from abroad who were later found to be infected . 
Mr Peres shook hands and hugged 120 youngsters from a 5,000-strong party visiting the country as guests of the Birthright Israel organization . 
The alarm was raised when 20 of them , along with 18 soldiers accompanying the group , tested positive for the virus . 
Mr Peres and staff at his official home were cleared of H1N1 virus infection . 
President Peres said he did not regret meeting the young people last week : Swine flu is a respiratory disease thought to spread through coughing and sneezing Symptoms mimic those of normal flu Good hygiene like using a tissue and washing hands thoroughly can help reduce transmission Birthright Israel provides expenses-paid 10-day trips to Israel for Jewish adults aged 18-26 who have not visited the country before . 
There have been 117 confirmed cases of the swine flu virus in Israel , according to the World Health Organization .

2009-06-17,"Second pupil tested for swine flu A second child is being treated with antiviral drugs for swine flu A further 34 pupils and staff at a primary school in Warrington have been given anti-viral drugs after a second child was treated for swine flu . 
The child in year five at Grappenhall Heys Primary School in Grappenhall ` developed probable swine flu ' , said Warrington Primary Care Trust -LRB- PCT -RRB- . 
On Monday it was confirmed a four-year-old child at the school 's nursery had tested positive . 
The children have spent time ` in close contact outside school ' , said the PCT . 
The four-year-old child is thought to have caught it from a 40-year-old man , a close relative who has contracted the infection . 
A spokesman for the PCT added : `` Both pupils are recovering well . '' 
A total of 99 pupils and staff at the school have now been treated with anti-virals to tackle the H1N1 infection . 
The school will remain open and pupils will continue to attend following a risk assessment by the Heath Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- . 
Dr Rita Robertson , director of Public Health for Warrington PCT said : `` There is n't an outbreak in the school . 
`` We have one confirmed case and one probable case who had been in close contact with each other away from the school . 
`` We are of course continuing to monitor the situation closely . 
`` We have taken all reasonable measures to protect children and staff in the school and to reduce the risk of onward transmission of infection . ''

2009-06-17,"Wednesday 17 June 2009 15.39 BST Government officials today warned that anyone with flu symptoms should stay away from pigs as evidence mounted that the present swine flu virus in humans could potentially infect the animals . 
Vets and scientists have apparently demonstrated in an experiment at a UK research center that the H1N1 virus responsible for the global pandemic in people readily transfers to the animals . 
Animal and public health specialists remain cautious about the consequences of their findings , which they describe as `` preliminary '' , saying firm conclusions can not be drawn . 
Despite its name , there are no known cases of people infected in the present swine flu crisis catching the illness from pigs or other animals , but there has been a case in Canada where pigs are thought to have caught the flu from a carpenter returning from Mexico . 
However , swine flu is caused by a virus that usually infects pigs , and the animals are among those generally considered most likely to act as mixing vessels for different strains of flu that could turn into highly contagious diseases . 
The experiment , a cross-EU venture conducted at the government 's veterinary labs in Weybridge , Surrey , involved infecting a group of pigs with a virus strain from an infected person in North America . 
Early analysis of the experiment suggests not only that the pigs are susceptible to the virus but that it transmits to other pigs , the team reports in a letter to the Veterinary Record journal . 
Defra , the government department responsible for the agricultural monitoring against swine flu in pigs , said : `` These findings reinforce existing guidance to pig keepers -LRB- or anyone else coming into contact with pigs -RRB- that they should stay out of contact with pigs if they have flu-like symptoms and should continue to practice high levels of hygiene . 
`` There is no evidence that this strain of influenza virus is -LRB- otherwise -RRB- present in pigs in this country . 
We continue to take the situation very seriously and will maintain our surveillance effort , keeping the public and industry informed of any developments . ''

2009-06-17,"Swine flu diagnosis doubts prompt tests rethink Scottish suspected swine flu cases to be checked by labs before being announced after apparent misdiagnoses by doctors Wednesday 17 June 2009 19.29 BST Scores of swine flu cases in Scotland may have been wrongly diagnosed by family doctors , it emerged today , forcing health officials to abandon a new testing regime . 
Scottish ministers announced last week that GPs were to be allowed to diagnose the virus at their surgeries , rather than rely on lab tests . 
The number of cases soared to 498 by the weekend , followed on Sunday by the first death of someone with swine flu outside the Americas . 
The victim , Jacqui Fleming , 38 , from Carnwadric , Glasgow , also had underlying health problems . 
After doctors reported 351 cases in Glasgow and Paisley yesterday a dramatic increase on previous daily results doubts emerged about the accuracy of their diagnoses . 
This evening , the Scottish government confirmed that further analysis of these results suggested a large majority of these were wrong . 
As a result , every suspected case of H1N1 swine flu will now be checked by laboratories before being announced . 
The reverse in policy will be studied carefully by health officials in Birmingham . 
They said today that efforts to control swine flu in the city the worst affected in England were failing . 
Giving GPs the authority to diagnose the virus at their surgeries was one option being considered . 
Nicola Sturgeon , the Scottish health secretary , said : `` It is important that we have accurate figures to give us a true picture of how the virus is spreading . 
That is why we have resumed laboratory testing for all cases in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area . 
`` Clinical diagnosis has not proven to be as effective as originally thought . 
Further assessment is being carried out to assess the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis process . '' 
The official number of swine flu cases in Scotland increased by 22 to 530 today , and there were 110 new cases in England , taking the UK total to 1,604 .

The cruise ship , owned by Royal Caribbean Cruises -LRB- RCL . 
N -RRB- , is docked off the Venezuelan island of Margarita and the 1,200 people aboard will not be allowed off for a week , Venezuelan officials said . 
`` The virus was detected in three crew members and the boat must now stay in quarantine until June 24 , '' state health official Jorge Alchaer said in comments printed by the government news service . 
On Monday , the Ocean Dream operated by Pullmantur Cruises docked in Grenada , but no one was permitted to leave the ship because of reports several people on board had flu-like symptoms , a spokesman for Grenada 's Health Ministry said . 
The cruise liner 's next destination was Barbados on Tuesday , but health officials refused to let the ship dock because 43 crew members exhibited flu-like symptoms , the Barbados Ministry of Health said in a statement . 
Miami-based Royal Caribbean , which owns Pullmantur , said it could not comment on the situation . 
Pullmantur representatives were not immediately available for comment . 
Many of the small island states in the eastern Caribbean depend on cruise ship arrivals as an important source of foreign exchange for their vulnerable economies . 
A number of Caribbean states have reported confirmed cases of the H1N1 swine flu , which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization last week . 
Venezuela has confirmed at least 45 cases , with no deaths . 
One person died from the virus in nearby Colombia . 
Royal Caribbean Chief Executive Richard Fain said last week the flu outbreak had `` a short , but highly disruptive impact to our operations , '' although he added vessels were returning to their original itineraries . 
The launch of a Pullmantur cruise targeting Mexican nationals , the Pacific Dream , had to be canceled because of the H1N1 outbreak in Mexico , the epicenter of the pandemic .

2009-06-17,"- Maria Sheahan is a Reuters senior correspondent in Frankfurt . 
- So far , Europe has left it up to the United States , Russia and China to send people into space . 
But almost 50 years after Russia 's Yuri Gagarin made his first orbit around the earth , it 's about time that Europe finally enter the playing field , some say . 
`` Europe can not stay out of manned -LRB- space -RRB- flight forever , '' EADS unit Astrium Space Transportation 's CEO Alain Charmeau said at the Paris Air Show . 
Europe has its own space agency , ESA ; it has its own module on the International Space Station ; and it has sent its astronauts into space as passengers on the spacecraft of others . 
Launching its own manned spaceflight mission `` is not a budgetary issue , it is a matter of political willingness , '' Charmeau said . 
His company , which makes space launchers that carry satellites or other items into space and could make a lunar lander , would be one of many that would benefit from the additional business . 
Even outside the sphere of government-funded space programs , Charmeau said he expects to see more people going up into space , as paying tourists .

2009-06-17,"-LRB- For a factbox on the outbreak click -LRB- ID : nLG76170 -RRB- BEIJING , June 17 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - China plans to restrict movement in residential areas and shut down entertainment centres to prevent the H1N1 flu strain from spreading , under worst case contingency plans released by the health ministry on Wednesday . 
The ministry says stringent quarantine measures on incoming travellers have prevented the disease from spreading among the general population . 
With 264 cases as of Wednesday , and new cases cropping up around China , the ministry 's new plan seeks to address possible outbreaks in residential neighborhoods . 
Schools could be closed and meetings or gatherings delayed or canceled , the plan said . 
China has been eager to show it can effectively control H1N1 , after its cover-up of SARS contributed to the spread of that disease . 
Experts also fear the flu strain could turn more lethal if it spread widely in China , given the large population and uneven health services . 
Many foreigners chafed at China 's quarantine restrictions on travellers , which in some cases seemed illogical . 
The World Health Organization warned that China 's current policy is too resource intensive to be sustainable should the disease become widespread . 
Roughly one-quarter of the confirmed cases in China as of early June were United States citizens , the U.S. embassy in Beijing said earlier this month , suggesting that Chinese caution in quarantining hundreds of American travellers was justified . 
The WHO declared H1N1 a pandemic last week following a spike in cases in Australia .

2009-06-18,"The school has been temporarily closed as a precaution Two new cases of swine flu have been confirmed in Jersey , bringing the total number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus in the Channel Island to three . 
According to the States , Helvetia House School has been closed as a precaution because of one of the cases . 
The two new cases were unrelated and both patients were receiving treatment and doing well , the States said . 
A patient who last week was confirmed to have the virus has since made a full recovery , the States added . 
A decision will be made on Monday on when to reopen Helvetia House School . 
Dr Susan Turnbull , deputy medical officer of health , said that those who have been in contact with the patients who need preventive treatment with Tamiflu medication have been contacted and she urged islanders to practice good hygiene to stop the virus spreading . 
`` It 's essential that people practice good hygiene , such as using tissues when coughing and sneezing , and regularly washing hands with soap to prevent the virus from spreading once cases arise in the island , '' she added . 
`` It 's also important that parents remind and help children to follow basic hygiene measures . '' 
Jersey doctors are being advised to test all patients with flu-like symptoms for Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , in particular anyone aged between five and 44 with a fever of 38C or more and with symptoms including a cough , sore throat , headaches or joint pain . 
Anyone with flu-like symptoms should ask for a home visit from their GP rather than visit the surgery . 
Islanders seeking advice about Swine Flu should call a special helpline set up on 01534 445566 . 
It is answered from 0830 BST to 1730 BST Monday to Friday .

2009-06-18,"Swine flu was last week declared a global pandemic South Africa 's first swine flu case - a 12-year-old boy who flew in from the US - has been confirmed . 
The boy was admitted to a private hospital on Monday morning and discharged after treatment , said health ministry spokesman Fidel Hadebe . 
Laboratory tests came back positive on Thursday for the H1N1 virus . 
While there have been nearly 30 cases of swine flu in Egypt and several in Morocco , this is the first known case of the virus in sub-Saharan Africa . 
Last week , the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- declared the outbreak a pandemic . 
`` The patient was kept in isolation and discharged after a few days in hospital . 
He is well and recovering in isolation at home , '' said Mr Hadebe in a statement . 
Health officials have warned that countries in the southern hemisphere - which includes the bulk of sub-Saharan Africa - could see a leap in cases of H1N1 because they are currently heading into winter and the height of flu season . 
Northern hemisphere countries are bracing for a surge in swine flu when their winter begins later this year . 
Correspondents say South Africa has good medical facilities well-equipped to deal with any swine flu epidemic . 
Swine flu has infected some 40,000 people in more than 70 countries and killed 167 since detected in Mexico in April , says the WHO .

2009-06-18,"London swine flu cases up by 95 The healthcare worker fell ill on Wednesday Ninety-five new swine flu cases have been confirmed by the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- , taking the total number of cases in the capital to 289 . 
A healthcare worker from Royal Free hospital in Hampstead , north London , and an employee at Canary Wharf branch of Waitrose were among the new cases . 
A hospital spokesman said the female worker fell ill at work on Wednesday . 
Waitrose said in a statement their worker had not been into the store for nine days and was making a recovery . 
There are currently 1,752 confirmed cases of swine flu across the UK . 
A Waitrose spokesman said : `` A partner at our Canary Wharf branch has been confirmed as having contracted swine flu . 
`` The partner , who has not been into the branch for nine days , has been treated with Tamiflu by their GP and is making a good recovery . '' 
The supermarket branch had remained open following advice from the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- and the World Health Organisation . 
The spokesman from Royal Free Hospital said the healthcare worker was sent home as soon as she reported feeling unwell and has not been back at work . 
She was recovering at home . 
Two pupils from the school tested positive The spokesman added that all those who came in contact with her have been asked to report any symptoms but no-one has come forward yet . 
Her job involved having contact with patients . 
The hospital received the results of the tests on Thursday . 
Over the past two days , 13 primary school children from three schools were confirmed to have contracted the H1N1 virus . 
Two pupils at Bentworth Primary School in west London tested positive for the flu . 
Eight Year Six students and a teacher from Immanuel and St Andrew Church of England Primary School in Streatham fell ill after a trip to Surrey . 
Three other boys from Year Seven at The Hall School in Belsize Park contracted the flu after returning from a school trip to Normandy . 
The schools have remained open on the advice of the HPA .

2009-06-19,"Panic over Uganda swine flu hoax South Africa is the only sub-Saharan country with a confirmed swine flu case A hoax text message warning people that swine flu had broken out in Uganda has caused panic and confusion this week . 
It purported to come from the health ministry , told people not to eat pork and promised free airtime for those who passed the message to 25 other people . 
The ministry held a press conference denying the `` baseless rumor '' . 
But the BBC 's Ignatius Bahizi in the capital , Kampala , says the confusion persisted as the ministry often uses texts to spread its health messages . 
The Daily Monitor newspaper reports that the hoax message was even debated in parliament . 
Our reporter , who received the text on Tuesday night from a friend , says he took it seriously at first . 
`` Ministry of Health warning ; to avoid swine flu which is suspected to be already in Uganda , you are advised not to eat pork or be near pigs for the time being . 
The first case reported in Ggaba and Nakulabye . 
Send this message to 25 people and MTN will reward you with airtime , '' it said . 
The ministry released its statement the next day and stressed that well-prepared pork was safe to eat . 
Our reporter says people were surprised it hear the text was a scam . 
Only recently a health ministry text message warned people about a polio outbreak and urged people to get immunised . 
But correspondents say the scam is now the source of some amusement . 
Sub-Saharan Africa 's first case of the H1N1 virus was reported in South Africa on Thursday .

2009-06-19,"By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Fri Jun 19 , 2009 9:46 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new strain of H1N1 flu is causing `` something different '' to happen in the United States this year -- perhaps an extended year-round flu season that disproportionately hits young people , health officials said on Thursday . 
An unusually cool late spring may be helping keep the infection going in the U.S. Northeast , especially densely populated areas in New York and Massachusetts , the officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . 
And infections among healthcare workers suggest that people are showing up at work sick -- meaning that workplace policies may be contributing to its spread , the CDC officials said . 
The new strain of swine flu is officially a pandemic now , according to the World Health Organization . 
So far the virus is causing mild to moderate disease , but it has killed at least 167 people and been confirmed in nearly 40,000 globally . 
The United States has been hardest hit , with upward of 100,000 likely cases and probably far more , with 44 deaths and 1,600 hospitalized . 
`` The fact that we are seeing ongoing transmission now indicates that we are seeing something different , '' the CDC 's Dr. Daniel Jernigan told a news briefing . 
`` And we believe that that may have to do with the complete lack of immunity to this particular virus among those that are most likely affected . 
And those are children , '' Jernigan added . 
`` The areas of the country that are most affected , some of them have very high population densities , like Boston and New York . 
So that may be a contributor as well . 
Plus the temperature in that part of the country is cooler , and we know that influenza appears to like the cooler times of the year for making transmission for effective . '' 
Jernigan said in areas that are the most affected up to 7 percent of the population has influenza-like illness . 
`` The United States will likely continue to see influenza activity through the summer , and at this point we 're anticipating that we will see the novel H1N1 continue with activity probably all the way into our flu season in the fall and winter . 
The amount of activity we expect to be low , and then pick up later . '' 
One worrying pattern : healthcare workers are being infected , and most reported they did little or nothing to protect themselves , the CDC 's Dr. Mike Bell said . 
People coming into emergency departments or clinics need to be checked right away for flu symptoms and anyone working with such a patient needs to wear a mask , gloves and eyewear , Bell said . 
`` We 're beginning to see a pattern of healthcare personnel-to-healthcare personnel transmission in some of the clusters , which is also concerning , because it gets to the issue of people showing up to work sick , '' Bell said . 
Doctors , nurses and technicians who have flu can spread it to vulnerable patients , Bell noted . 
As of May 13 , the CDC said it had received 48 reports of healthcare workers infected with swine flu . 
Detailed case reports on 26 showed that 13 were infected in a healthcare setting such as a clinic or hospital and 12 caught it from infected patients , the CDC said in its weekly report on death and disease .

2009-06-19,"2009 06 19 22:54 JST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. Congress on Thursday sent President Barack Obama a $ 106 billion bill to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars after political sparring that could foreshadow tougher fights over Obama 's agenda . 
The bill , delayed by disputes over quickly closing the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay and expanding support for the IMF , highlighted the difficulties Obama may face in Congress even though his fellow Democrats control both the Senate and House of Representatives . 
The bill contains $ 79.9 billion to continue fighting the two wars , $ 7.7 billion to address the H1N1 flu pandemic , and $ 1.4 billion in foreign aid for Pakistan , which is fighting Taliban militants spilling over the border from Afghanistan . 
`` The bill before us represents a balanced compromise between the issues and funding recommended by the House and Senate , '' said Democratic Senator Daniel Inouye , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee . 
The Senate voted 91-5 , with most Republicans joining Democrats to support it . 
Obama is expected to sign it into law . 
The House approval on Tuesday garnered only five Republican votes and 32 Democrats voted against it . 
Democrats have a commanding majority in the House , but still need to keep centrist Democrats aboard and win a few Republican votes in the Senate to forestall any procedural roadblocks mounted by the opposition party . 
After weeks of tense negotiations among the White House , Democrats and Republicans , lawmakers put limits on Obama 's efforts to close the controversial prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where more than 200 terrorism suspects are being held .

2009-06-19,"WASHINGTON | Fri Jun 19 , 2009 2:55 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Drug makers are gearing up to make vaccines against the new H1N1 virus , starting test batches and pledging free doses for poor countries . 
Governments are pledging billions for the vaccine -- the United States has set aside $ 1 billion , the Netherlands ordered 34 million doses and Australia has ordered 10 million doses as the World Health Organization declared a pandemic . 
Yet no one is sure yet whether even to give the vaccine to anyone and if so , who should get it . 
Usually the guidelines for influenza vaccination are clear -- give it to the oldest , the youngest and the sickest . 
In an average year , influenza is a factor in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths , and in developed countries , 90 percent are the elderly . 
But the new H1N1 swine flu virus is not behaving typically . 
It has dragged the Northern Hemisphere 's flu season well into June , although influenza usually dies way down by April . 
`` The fact that we are seeing ongoing transmission now indicates that we are seeing something different , '' Dr. Daniel Jernigan of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters this week . 
Most cases are in people aged 5 to 24 -- usually the last group to get seriously ill from flu and the last group vaccinated during a normal flu season . 
There have been few serious H1N1 cases among the elderly , perhaps because they have some pre-existing immunity to a similar H1N1 that circulated in the past , or maybe because their immune system response is different -- flu experts do not know yet . 
To decide what to do , WHO officials will have to watch and see what this new strain does . 
As WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said at the beginning of the pandemic last month , the world is watching it unfold in real time -- and much of humanity is taking part in a real-time experiment . 
If the virus continues to affect mostly older children and young adults , the strategy should be clear -- vaccinate those groups . 
And at least one study supports this idea for other reasons . 
This week a team at Britain 's University of Warwick said computer models suggest that vaccinating children aged 6 months to 18 years may be the best way of using limited supplies to control the pandemic . 
Because schools can be epicenters for spreading flu infection , including the new H1N1 , this might make more sense than trying more general approaches . 
Vaccinating schoolchildren would prevent them from spreading it to two more vulnerable groups -- the elderly and the very young . 
It may also protect those clearly more at risk from both H1N1 and seasonal flu -- people with asthma , diabetes and heart disease , suppressed immune systems and pregnant women . 
By Friday , WHO had confirmed 44,287 cases of the new flu and 180 deaths , with Laos , Oman , Papua New Guinea , South Africa all reporting their first cases . 
The United States alone has more than 21,000 cases with officials saying there are likely at least 10 times that many , and 87 deaths . 
WHO estimates vaccine makers could produce up to 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots a year at most . 
That would depend on how many doses people needed and whether vaccine boosters called adjuvants could be used to stretch out the doses . 
Even this best-case scenario would leave more than a billion people unvaccinated . 
Vaccine maker Sanofi-Aventis , which says it makes 40 percent of the world 's supply of flu vaccine , says at full capacity its two Pennsylvania factories can make 150 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccine a year . 
Its French plant can make 120 million doses per year . 
This would triple for H1N1 , as the seasonal vaccine is a cocktail of three different viruses . 
Other companies that make flu vaccine include Novartis AG , Baxter International Inc , GlaxoSmithKline and Solvay .

2009-06-22,"Fergus Walsh | 16:45 UK time , Monday , 22 June 2009 A sharp increase in the global number of cases and deaths can been seen in the latest figures from the World Health Organisation . 
The total now stands at 52,160 laboratory-confirmed cases including 231 deaths in around 100 countries and territories . 
Beware any attempt to derive a `` death rate '' from such figures -LRB- which , by my reckoning , would come out as four deaths in every 1,000 people infected -RRB- . 
As has been repeatedly pointed out , the vast majority of cases go unrecorded , so the figure of 52,160 is a huge underestimate of the actual numbers . 
Work is clearly needed to get a more accurate figure for the mortality and morbidity -LRB- ill-health -RRB- associated with the virus . 
England has also seen a series of big daily increases in lab-confirmed cases in recent days . 
There were 204 new cases confirmed by lab tests today ; the total number in England has doubled in just five days , with the West Midlands accounting for half of all infections . 
The vast majority of those infected have experienced mild flu-like symptoms and fully recovered . 
There have been no deaths in England and one in Scotland . 
The graphs below will show you the figures for the six countries worldwide with the biggest case-loads , in descending order : United States , Mexico , Canada , Chile , UK , Australia . 
Very mild virus , lacks the properties to turn deadly , has the same chance of becoming very virluent as seasonal flu , would need to go through a rediculous amount of mutations to even come close to being as virluent as the pandemics in the 50s and 60s . 
Its milder than seasonal flu , it will stay milder than seasonal flu . 
Not much else to say really ... I just feel for the poor people with health anxiety being bombarded with `` worst case scenarios '' and `` doomsday predictions '' by the mass media . 
Oh well ... At 9:53 pm on 22 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Skyline , I do n't think the issue is the severity of the flu , it is more about the age group who are being hospitalised if they become ill . 
The issue is also more about resources and how to maintain adequate staffing levels in hospitals to cope with the influx of flu victims . 
The country is in an economic downturn , which means that health authorities are forced to maintain strict budget controls , which means making choices . 
Hospitals need a full staff of trained , expensive workers to keep wards open , in a time when cut backs and cost cutting are necessary . 
The problem is that routine investigations and operations may be put on hold until the main rush of hospital dependent flu victims have all gone home . 
The problem is that the staff themselves could become ill , making it necessary to employ even more expensive agency workers . 
The problem is that isolation and preventative measures need to be enforced and this can become very expensive . 
Some of the flu victims are high dependency , needing specialist equipment and specialist nursing and adequate barrier nursing . 
The wards and equipment will then need to be thoroughly cleaned by trained cleaners . 
Specialist equipment takes up space and therefore the beds have to be spaced further apart from each other in order to make room for the equipment and allow for barrier nursing . 
It could be you who needs a routine investigation and surgery , which will now be either rushed forward or put on hold until the flu numbers subside . 
So we are not talking about doomsday or worse case scenarios , just economic realities and that is why I asked if the health service requires volunteers to help with some of the basic tasks . 
I agree that some people may have health anxieties but they may be for a good reason if they fall into one of the categories that may need extra attention . 
Again , I think we are talking about volume not severity .

I have an autoimmune condition and my immune system does n't cope well with viruses such as Norovirus , Chicken Pox and seasonal flu . 
My daughter has a similar problem with her immune system . 
We are both well aware of the distiction between flu and a cold .

If the teacher in the west midlands who has Lupus did n't get Tamiflu , in spite of being in a high risk area , working in an infected school and likely to communicate this to many others , how much truth IS there in the guidance being issued by the government and the NHS ?

Sorry but the link you posted to is laughable . 
Its dealing with completley different influenza strains , and they have as much chance of affecting the `` swine flu '' variant as they do seasonal . 
Influenza can be pretty dangerous , but the current pandemic strain , is less virluent and as likely to become a `` superflu '' as seasonal flu is .

One can infer from the data , that some individuals are not taking personal responsibility . 
I was irritated by the fact that someone , who should know better , could travel through a country for five days , knowing that he possibly had swine flu . 
To travel through a country , on a packed train , with a disease which that country is trying hard to contain , is totally selfish and irresponsible . 
It appears that disease is more often passed from country to country , not by the poor but those who can make choices . 
I believe that preparedness can do much to ameliorate difficult situations . 
That is why WHO , the DH and the MRC have been pumping money into research in this field for some years . 
Some of these trials I have been involved with professionally so I 'm not speculating any more than my job requires . 
I was prompted to post because I was appalled by your ostrich-like attitude . 
Too many people are telling each other that H1N1 is a non-event just like SARS , bird flu , global warming , etc etc , and that it is being hyped by the media in order to sell papers and by the government for some weird experiment in social control . 
To lull people into a false sense of seurity based on the fact that we live in a well-nourished nation with advanced medicine and that they therefore do not need to take personal responsibility for their own well-being is positively dangerous .

I refuse to sit here and discuss the absolute worst case scenarios with people . 
again my key points ... 2 . 
same risk of mutation . 
would need at least 4 major mutations to become anything even remotely severe . 
This is a gigantic amount in virology . 
As opposed to headless chicken am i right ? 
You have no idea what you are talking about evidently and trawling sites like what you linked to would be completley pointless for the people commenting . 
As the WHO point out `` around one third to half of the severe and fatal infections are occurring in previously healthy young and middle-aged people . '' 
You will also note that they have ceased to define H1N1 as `` mild '' but have instead designated it of `` moderate '' severity . 
However the transmissibility is much greater , hence a global pandemic , as opposed to an epidemic or an outbreak . 
The greater the number of infected people , the greater the chances of recombination . 
It may mutate into a form which is no longer a risk to humans , or it may not . 
I could n't disagree more with your assertion that it is not necessary to discuss worst case scenarios . 
If estimates that 40 % of the population may be absent from work at any one time prove correct , it would be idiotic to imagine that services will carry on as usual . 
This is not headless chicken syndrome but sensible planning . 
To suggest that the general public should be shielded from such models smacks of elitism of the worst kind . 
Contingency plans need to be put in place across the board , using the ethos `` prepare for the worst and hope for the best '' .

I am new to this blog but have been reading your posts with great interest . 
I too became worried with the haedlines comparing the SF to the 1918 Pandemic .

Although this could be attributed to the high levels of arsenic in the drinking water , I just wondered what you made of the death rate in healthy people . 
Also , I have read with great interest the notion that most of the illness from 1918 was caused due to the vaccinations that the soldiers received a mixed cocktail of before going to war . 
Civillians were also vaccinated when the soldiers came home sick . 
There are reports from those days of infantile paralysis in soldiers , something that is linked to vaccine poison . 
Also , the way the soldiers symptoms were treated , were likely to have killed them more than the diseases alone . 
What do you make of the point that it was the drug makers that killed all those people back then ? 
Do you think that the new vaccine will be safe ? 
Given that in 1976 it caused deaths and paralysis . 
I am v confused . 
I do not know if I want my two daughters to have the vaccine . 
I am also confused by the comparisons to 1918 in the media . 
Some say that it was purely bird flu in 1918 , some say swine . 
Swine is H1n1 , but Avian Flu H5N1 . 
So was the 1918 caused by swine or bird or all three ? 
Do you think that given the economic climate , this is a very quick way for people to make some money ? 
I spoke to an old friend the other day who told me a few moths ago he may be losing his job . 
Yet a few days ago , he was chipper , business was great , lots of sales . 
He sells machines that make packaging for pharmaceutical companies . 
Also , it wouldnt do the shares any harm either . 
Sorry if i am clueless . 
I appreciate your posts , your statistics put my mind at ease .

2009-06-22,"Pupils have been given anti-viral medication as a precaution A school in Dorset is to close for one week after a pupil tested positive for swine flu . 
The child is a pupil at Verwood Church of England First School , and has since fully recovered after contracting the H1N1 virus . 
Pupils in the child 's class are being treated with anti-viral medication as a precaution , NHS Dorset said . 
The school will close from the end of Monday . 
Parents have been given advice about the symptoms of the disease .

2009-06-23,"Charlotte John said students at Cambridge University were being given a lot of advice about swine flu Seventeen new cases of swine flu at Cambridge University have been confirmed by health officials . 
The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- said that the new cases meant that there were 20 confirmed cases among students at colleges in Cambridge . 
Close contacts of the students were receiving antiviral drugs as a precaution , said the HPA . 
Also in Cambridge , Impington Village College will be shut for a week after two pupils tested positive . 
Burwell Village College Primary is also due to remain closed until Thursday after three cases there . 
The HPA said it made the decision to close the schools in the best interest of pupils and staff . 
The university students have tested positive for influenza A , H1N1 -LRB- also known as swine flu -RRB- . 
The students concerned are receiving the `` appropriate medical care and recovering away from other students '' , said the HPA . 
Cambridge University is working closely with the HPA and NHS colleagues to monitor the situation . 
Staff and students have been reminded to be vigilant and should they develop flu-like symptoms the advice of the Health Protection Agency is to contact their GP or NHS Direct . 
Each case will be assessed and , if necessary , testing and treatment will be provided .

2009-06-23,"BERLIN | Tue Jun 23 , 2009 5:48 pm EDT BERLIN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Germany 's federal agency for infectious diseases said on Tuesday there were signs the H1N1 swine flu virus had started to mutate and warned it could spread in the coming months in a more aggressive form . 
Experts were concerned about how the flu was developing in Australia and South America , said Joerg Hacker , head of the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases . 
`` It 's possible the virus has mutated . 
In autumn the mutated form could spread to the northern hemisphere and back to Germany , '' Hacker told a news conference in Berlin . 
The World Health Organization raised swine flu to pandemic status earlier this month . 
According to its latest figures , more than 230 people have been killed by the flu worldwide from 52,000 confirmed cases , mostly in the United States and Mexico . 
Symptoms of swine flu are typically fairly mild , but doctors have said the virus could evolve into something more aggressive . 
According to WHO figures , Germany has the third highest rate of swine flu infection in Europe with 275 confirmed cases . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the conference that Germany was as prepared as it could be for any surge in cases . 
`` We are in contact about it internationally , '' she said . 
`` Now all we have to do is coordinate internationally who should be vaccinated and how we should do it , in case things get worse . '' 
The WHO has advised governments to prepare for a long-term battle against the new pandemic it officially calls A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . 
WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said recently the virus is currently `` pretty stable , '' but warned it could still change into a more deadly form , perhaps mixing with the H5N1 bird flu virus circulating widely in poultry .

The program visits a Sheffield clinic which has significantly reduced incidents of adolescents cutting and harming themselves with a new ` zero tolerance ' rule . 
However , this is controversial because many believe that accepting and working with self-harming behavior is the best long-term approach . 
Dr Tony Livesey , the psychiatrist behind the Sheffield experiment , tells Claudia Hammond why he thinks the new policy has worked so well for the young people in his care and Marjorie Wallace from SANE argues that prohibition risks denying individuals a coping strategy and would force self-harmers to be even more secretive in their behavior . 
The numbers of people in the UK that have confirmed swine flu is heading towards the 3,000 mark . 
Governments the world over have been putting their H1N1 virus pandemic plans in place , and communicating with the public is a crucial part of these preparations .

2009-06-24,"Argentine swine flu deaths hit 17 Mexico 's deputy health minister on how his country dealt with swine flu Argentine health officials say seven more people have died from swine flu , bringing the number of deaths to 17 . 
All the fatalities have been in the capital and the province of Buenos Aires , the health ministry said . 
It is currently winter in Argentina , where 1,294 cases have been reported , and Chile , which has seen some 5,000 cases and seven deaths . 
The spread of swine flu in the region is being closely watched for lessons for the northern hemisphere winter . 
On 11 June , the World Health Organization declared a global flu pandemic , meaning that the swine flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus was spreading in at least two regions of the world . 
Officials stressed that this did not mean the virus was causing more severe illness or more deaths . 
According to the latest figures from the WHO , there have been 231 deaths and 52,160 cases in some 100 countries and territories . 
SWINE FLU - THE BASICS Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Current treatments do work , but as yet there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised The Argentine health ministry reported the rise in the death toll on Tuesday . 
More people have died of swine flu in Argentina than any other country in South America . 
Measures to prevent and control the spread of the H1N1 virus would continue , the ministry said . 
Buenos Aires health chief Nestor Perez Balino told local media that some non-urgent operations were being postponed to free up hospital beds . 
But he said the situation regarding the H1N1 virus was no more worrying than seasonal flu , and that patients who had died had suffered other medical complications . 
Swine flu `` is very infectious but no more virulent than regular flu '' , he said . 
The H1N1 virus first emerged in April in Mexico , which has recorded 113 deaths and 7,624 cases , according to the WHO . 
In an interview with the BBC , Mexican Deputy Health Minister Mauricio Hernandez Avila said his country was prepared for the outbreak , having had a plan in place for four or five years to deal with a pandemic . 
`` We took 10 days from the -LRB- first -RRB- case to alert the world that we were seeing a new virus , '' he said . 
`` We did , I think , a remarkable good job in ... preparing the world for this event . '' 
The Mexican authorities are hosting an international summit on swine flu in Cancun next month . 
Chilean President Michelle Bachelet , who has been visiting Washington , was due to hold talks with officials from the Pan American Health Organization . 
She is set to travel later on Wednesday to Mexico . 
Her country has seen cases of swine flu rise to 5,186 - the most in South America - and reported seven deaths , according to the health ministry . 
Last week , the Chilean government stepped up measures to deal with the outbreak . 
Worldwide , the US , which has seen 87 deaths , has reported the most cases with 21,449 . 
Canada has seen 15 deaths and 6,457 cases , according to the Canadian health ministry .

2009-06-24,"2009 06 24 07:14 JST CHICAGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. government is investing in a new technique for making flu vaccines that it hopes will help the nation respond quickly to outbreaks such as the H1N1 swine flu virus . 
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Tuesday her department had awarded a $ 35 million contract to privately held Protein Sciences Corp Inc of Meriden , Connecticut , to use its new gene-based techniques to develop a vaccine and test it in clinical trials . 
If testing goes well , the contract could be expanded over five years for a total of nearly $ 150 million . 
`` The technology has advanced in recent years to a point that we believe it could help meet a surge in demand for U.S.-based vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu , '' Sebelius said in a statement . 
`` We want to use the technology to help our nation respond to emerging infectious diseases . '' 
The United States has set aside $ 1 billion for a vaccine to combat the H1N1 strain that has caused a global pandemic . 
The cash infusion comes as Protein Sciences , which is developing a quicker way to make vaccines , fights to stay in business . 
Three creditors filed a petition on Monday in Delaware court seeking to force the company into involuntary bankruptcy .

2009-06-24,"JAKARTA | Wed Jun 24 , 2009 8:20 pm EDT JAKARTA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Slum-dweller Krustin bin Juri lost everything when floodwaters swept through his home and shop on the banks of Jakarta 's filthy Ciliwung river two years ago . 
But when the next flood hits , and it will because Jakarta sees frequent floods in the rainy season , bin Juri may have a modicum of protection thanks to a low-cost insurance policy that he purchased this month . 
He is among millions of the world 's poor who are covered for natural disasters by cheap insurance , or microinsurance , as commercial firms recognize that insuring the poor is not just good public relations but also profitable . 
`` Interest in microinsurance has been exploding throughout the world , '' said Craig Thorburn , a senior insurance specialist at the World Bank who has developed microinsurance programs and who advises countries on insurance market development . 
`` New projects and proposals are being developed in more and more countries . 
Government policy-makers are reviewing their regulations and the microinsurance sector does not appear to have been slowed by the crisis . '' 
Microinsurance began as a form of charity in the 1990s , when the International Labor Organization began experimenting with super-cheap insurance policies , said Michael McCord , president of the U.S.-based MicroInsurance Center who recently discussed the topic with officials at Indonesia 's central bank . 
In 1995 , McCord said he developed an entirely commercial microinsurance product backed by insurer AIG , with a view to selling it through a microfinance institute in Uganda . 
`` This example showed that commercial microinsurance is possible and became the demonstration model that helped other commercial insurers recognize the low-income market as viable , '' he said . 
Within a decade , AIG 's Ugandan business covered about 1.6 million lives , and microinsurance premiums accounted for nearly 17 percent of its Ugandan unit 's profits . 
Today , a $ 1,000 life insurance policy sells for just $ 1 a year in Uganda , McCord said , making it affordable to the poor . 
He estimates that about 135 million low-income people worldwide are now covered by cheap insurance , up from 78 million two years ago . 
Investors are seeing potential in what could be a multi-billion dollar industry . 
The Leapfrog Financial Inclusion Fund announced last week that it had raised $ 44 million for what it said was the world 's first microinsurance fund . 
`` The world desperately needs market-based solutions to poverty that draw in major financial investors by offering fair but competitive returns , '' said Dr. Andrew Kuper , President and Founder of LeapFrog , a Luxembourg-based fund . 
`` Microinsurance is both profitable and scalable , '' he was quoted as saying on the fund 's website . 
The fund will invest in India , Pakistan , South Africa , Ghana and Kenya , it added . 
Some governments have taken a more active role in promoting such insurance schemes to the poor . 
For example in India , it is compulsory for insurer firms to offer a microinsurance product , though the results have been mixed . 
In practice , only about a third of India 's insurance firms offer such products , said Rupalee Ruchismita , founder of the Center for Insurance and Risk Management in India , which works with insurers and microfinance firms to develop livestock , health , weather , and catastrophe insurance plans . 
`` Most insurance firms are doing it simply to meet targets or to be in the good books of the regulators , and their argument is that it is very difficult to reach the intended audience , '' she said . 
Insurance experts , including Ruchismita and McCord , said such microinsurance schemes tend to be more successful when a community-based organization works in partnership with a private insurer , as both have strengths in different areas . 
For insurers , the sheer number of potential customers in the low-income bracket makes this an attractive market . 
`` About 80 percent of the world population live in emerging markets but they account for only 22 percent of global GDP and 9 percent of global premiums , '' said Kua Ka Hin , Munich Re 's chief executive for Singapore and Southeast Asia . 
`` These emerging markets still offer huge potential ; they have got the large numbers which underline the principle of insurance . '' 
Kua says Munich Re is looking at microinsurance products in Asia covering earthquakes , typhoons and even loss of income for businesses forced to close because of a flu , or H1N1 , pandemic . 
Last month , Munich Re began a trial of the world 's first flood microinsurance policy in flood-prone central Jakarta . 
Residents in Manggarai district pay 50,000 rupiah -LRB- $ 4.88 -RRB- for a flood `` cash card '' that can be cashed in for 250,000 rupiah if floodwater levels rise to or above 9.5 meters at the Manggarai Water Gate , which is 2 meters above normal levels . 
So far only 50 policies have been sold , partly because the insurance only covers the very worst floods , not the recurrent knee-high flooding that can still ruin homes and possessions . 
`` People say 950 cm is too high and it 's unlikely to happen . 
Also , the payout , they said , is too small , '' said Francis Purwanta , a spokesman for Munich Re 's local partner , Asuransi Wahana Tata , which sells the policies , pays out claims , and is then reimbursed by Munich Re . 
`` So we try to explain that it has happened before , at least three times in five years , '' said Purwanta . 
The idea of making a profit off the very poorest members of society is also controversial . 
Yet supporters say it is necessary if insurance companies are to back such policies . 
`` Companies can and should make profits of the low-income market . 
This is the only way we will get commercial insurers in the market , '' said McCord , who adds that non-profit organizations working alone rarely have the technical expertise to calculate the risks and then design an effective insurance program . 
`` A commercial approach is what 's needed here , across the board . 
But what helps a lot is using institutions that people trust to deliver the product . '' 
However , some critics , such as Wardah Hafidz , from the Indonesian non-government organization Urban Poor Consortium , suggest that governments are evading their responsibilities by expecting poor people to take out private insurance policies . 
`` The government should be giving protection from disasters to these people instead of assisting private business to target poor people to sell them their products , '' she said . 
The argument is less philosophical for flood victims such as Bin Juri who knows what it 's like to see his precious possessions washed away and is well aware that the 250,000 rupiah insurance policy he holds would be inadequate to cover his losses if another flood struck his home . 
`` That alone cost 90,000 rupiah , '' he said , pointing to a large cooking pot at his feet . 
`` But it 's some money at least . ''

2009-06-24,"WASHINGTON | Wed Jun 24 , 2009 6:44 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama on Wednesday signed into law a $ 106 billion measure to fulfill his plans to wind down the war in Iraq and ramp up operations in Afghanistan where fighting against militants is intensifying . 
The bill contains $ 79.9 billion to continue funding the two wars through September 30 . 
It was also loaded up with extras like $ 7.7 billion to address the H1N1 flu pandemic , and $ 1.4 billion in foreign aid for Pakistan , which is fighting Taliban militants spilling over the border from Afghanistan . 
The measure was nearly derailed by Obama 's request for money to close the controversial U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , as well as for $ 108 billion in credit lines to back the International Monetary Fund as it helps countries weather the global economic downturn . 
The legislation did not include $ 80 million Obama wanted for closing Guantanamo and bans releasing any detainees into the United States through September 30 . 
But it allows detainees to be brought to U.S. soil for trial . 
Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers demanded the White House produce a detailed plan before closing the Guantanamo prison camp . 
Before the legislation passed , the administration rushed to release or transfer more than a dozen detainees . 
Despite fierce Republican opposition , Obama ultimately prevailed to include in the legislation provisions to extend a $ 100 billion credit line to the IMF and expand the U.S. contribution to the multilateral lender by $ 8 billion . 
The legislation also endorses the IMF 's plan to sell 400 tons -LRB- 12.97 million ounces -RRB- of its gold reserves . 
House Republicans had expressed concern the IMF would use the funds to lend to U.S. foes like Iran and Venezuela and argued that the matter should have been considered separately . 
With the bill becoming law , Obama can follow through on a commitment he made with other Group of 20 member nations to add $ 500 billion to an IMF emergency fund for countries needing financial aid to avoid bankruptcy . 
The legislation also will kick off a controversial $ 1 billion program to boost depressed U.S. car sales . 
The measure offers vouchers of up to $ 4,500 to consumers who trade in their less fuel-efficient vehicles for ones that get better mileage .

2009-06-26,"CHICAGO | Fri Jun 26 , 2009 7:39 pm EDT CHICAGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - More than 1 million people in the United States may have been infected with the new H1N1 swine flu , U.S. health officials said on Friday , and infections continue to rise . 
The new H1N1 influenza virus that has triggered a global pandemic is infecting people in the United States well beyond the normal period for influenza season , Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in a telephone briefing . 
`` The key point is this new infectious disease is not going away , '' Schuchat said . 
`` In the U.S. , we 're still experiencing a steady increase in the number of reported cases , with 6,000 new cases reported just this week . '' 
That represents the largest number of cases to be reported in a one-week span since the beginning of the outbreak in April . 
The World Health Organization is now reporting more than 67,000 confirmed cases of H1N1 flu and some 300 deaths worldwide . 
In the United States , there have been 27,717 laboratory-confirmed cases , including more than 3,000 hospitalizations and 127 deaths . 
`` We are estimating about a million people in the U.S. or more have gotten this virus at a time of year when people really are n't continuing to get the seasonal influenza viruses , '' Schuchat said . 
`` A big question that everybody really has is what kind of illness , hospitalization and deaths will we see when our winter flu season begins ? '' 
Schuchat said vaccine makers are developing H1N1 vaccine that will be tested in clinical trials over the summer . 
She said the CDC has not yet decided if it will recommend people get the new shots when flu season in arrives in North America in the fall . 
But Schuchat said the CDC is asking state and local health departments to draw up plans for how to handle distribution of the vaccines . 
`` We want states to be ready to offer and administer this novel vaccine , '' she said , focusing especially on how to reach younger people , pregnant women and people with underlying health conditions like asthma and diabetes that put them at higher risk . 
At a three-day meeting in Atlanta of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , which advises the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , CDC researchers said one vaccination scenario could include as many as 600 million doses . 
That could place a heavy burden on cash-strapped health departments , which would likely have to distribute two doses of the new vaccine , which might be required for full immunity , in addition to the regular seasonal flu vaccination program . 
Schuchat said the CDC continues to watch for changes in the virus in the Southern Hemisphere , where flu season is now in full swing . 
`` We have not seen any changes in the virus that are important at this point , '' she said . 
In the United States , the new flu continues to spread , with 12 states reporting widespread flu activity , something Schuchat said was `` very unusual for this time of year . '' 
`` That is just one feature that helps us to see that what we are seeing is quite different , '' she said . 
She said flu infections are even affecting children attending camps in the Northern Hemisphere summer , with outbreaks in 34 camps in 16 states . 
`` Some have actually closed for the summer . ''

2009-06-29,"Swine flu ` shows drug resistance ' The drug has been offered to those with close contact to swine flu Experts have reported the first case of swine flu that is resistant to tamiflu - the main drug being used to fight the pandemic . 
Roche Holding AG confirmed a patient with H1N1 influenza in Denmark showed resistance to the antiviral drug . 
David Reddy , company executive , said it was not unexpected given that common seasonal flu could do the same . 
The news comes as a nine-year-old girl has become the third to die in the UK with swine flu . 
It is understood from her doctors at Birmingham Children 's Hospital that she had underlying health conditions . 
It is not yet known whether swine flu contributed to her death . 
Meanwhile , the Department of Health has announced a big jump in the number of patients in England confirmed with swine flu - up 1,604 since Friday , taking the UK total so far to 5,937 . 
Routine sampling in the UK has shown that there is currently no resistance to oseltamivir or zanamivir A Health Protection Agency spokeswoman Experts have been using tamiflu , also known as oseltamivir , in a bid to stop the H1N1 spreading in communities . 
If taken early , it ensures that symptoms are mild and reduces the chance of a victim giving the illness to someone else . 
This first reported case of resistance developed in a swine flu patient taking Tamiflu . 
Mr Reddy stressed that there were no signs of a tamiflu-resistant strain of H1N1 circulating in the community . 
This is in contrast to seasonal H1N1 flu where a Tamiflu resistant strain emerged last year and is now widely circulating . 
Experts fear if this were to happen , it could render tamiflu ineffective . 
Another antiviral drug , called zanamivir or Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKline , is also effective against swine flu . 
The UK government has been stockpiling these antiviral drugs and currently has enough to treat half of the population , with a contract to bring that up to 80 % as soon as possible . 
Supplies of flu vaccine have also been ordered and the first doses could be administered in the autumn . 
A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency said : `` The Health Protection Agency continues to watch for antiviral resistance and will be carrying out regular sample testing throughout this outbreak . 
`` We have been monitoring antiviral drug resistance since the beginning of this outbreak . 
Routine sampling in the UK has shown that there is currently no resistance to oseltamivir or zanamivir . '' 
Virologist Professor John Oxford said : `` I 'm not surprised about this finding . 
The question is whether it is going to spread . 
We will soon know the answer . ''

2009-06-29,"ZURICH | Mon Jun 29 , 2009 1:58 pm EDT ZURICH -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A patient with H1N1 influenza in Denmark showed resistance to Roche Holding AG 's Tamiflu , the main antiviral flu drug , a company executive said on Monday . 
`` While receiving the drug , the patient appeared to develop resistance to it , '' David Reddy , Roche 's pandemic taskforce leader , told reporters on a conference call on the Danish case . 
`` This is the first report we have of it in H1N1 . '' 
The World Health Organization has raised its pandemic flu alert on the H1N1 flu virus to phase 6 on a six-point scale , indicating the first influenza pandemic since 1968 is under way . 
Common seasonal flu can resist Tamiflu and Reddy said a case of resistance in H1N1 was not unexpected , adding Roche has been working on strategies to counter such a development .

2009-06-29,"ZURICH\/COPENHAGEN | Mon Jun 29 , 2009 1:58 pm EDT ZURICH\/COPENHAGEN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Scientists have established the first case of the new H1N1 influenza strain showing resistance to Tamiflu , the main antiviral flu drug , Danish officials and the manufacturer said on Monday . 
It was expected that the strain would at some point show resistance to Tamiflu , Denmark 's State Serum Institute said . 
The patient was now well and no further infection with the resistant virus had been detected . 
`` It does not constitute a risk to public health and does not cause changes to the recommendations for the use of oseltamivir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- , '' the institute said in a statement . 
The World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic earlier this month and advised governments to prepare for a long-term battle against an unstoppable new flu virus . 
The WHO had no immediate comment on the case of Tamiflu resistance . 
The United Nations agency has raised its pandemic flu alert to its highest alert level of 6 , indicating the first influenza pandemic since 1968 is underway . 
Flu viruses mutate regularly and can develop resistance to drugs at any time . 
The seasonal strain of H1N1 is a distant cousin of the swine flu and was widely resistant to Tamiflu this year . 
Common seasonal flu can resist Tamiflu and David Reddy , Roche 's pandemic taskforce leader , said a case of resistance in H1N1 -- also know as swine flu -- was not unexpected . 
Roche had been working on strategies to counter such a development , Reddy said . 
NO THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH The WHO has said Tamiflu was working against strains of the new H1N1 flu but some analysts have expressed concern it might be less effective than Relenza , GlaxoSmithKline 's inhaled drug , since there have been widespread reports of resistance by seasonal H1N1 flu . 
Roche stock closed up 1.4 percent at 149 Swiss francs , outperforming a 0.7 percent firmer DJ Stoxx European drugs index . 
Surveillance for antiviral resistance in the new strain is continuing , though the isolated case in Denmark does not pose a threat to public health or reason to change recommendations for use of Tamiflu , said David Daigle , a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventiom . 
`` It is well known and expected that influenza virus can mutate spontaneously . 
The resistance has not changed the capability of the virus to transmit or cause disease , and the assessment is still that this is a relatively mild influenza , '' Daigle said in an email .

2009-06-29,"UPDATE 1-GSK says Asia Pacific sales could double in 5 yrs \* Will lower prices in some Asian countries to boost sales \* Says Australia , NZ , Taiwan , Singapore have bought Relenza -LRB- Recasts with Asia-Pacific sales forecast -RRB- SINGAPORE , June 29 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline -LRB- GSK . 
L -RRB- said its Asia-Pacific sales could double in five years as growing prosperity boosts demand for better healthcare and as it cuts prices in some Asian countries . 
GSK Asia Pacific chief Christophe Weber said on Monday the company aimed to boost sales in countries such as China , Indonesia and the Philippines by selling drugs and vaccines for less than it typically charged in developed countries . 
`` Clearly there will be a very high demand in the future because the economic development of the countries in the region and people want more healthcare , '' Weber told Reuters on the sidelines of a regional media workshop in Singapore . 
GSK Asia Pacific last year chalked up 1.18 billion pounds -LRB- $ 2 billion -RRB- in sales last year , accounting for just under 5 percent of the company 's total sales . 
GSK estimates its Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical market share at 5.3 percent , making it the region 's fourth largest player . 
Highlighting the region 's potential , GSK said Asia Pacific had twice the number of newborns compared with North America or Western Europe , but mortality rates for mothers were 12 times higher than in Europe . 
For children under five , the mortality rate was 3 times higher than in the Americas . 
A lot of the deaths in children in the region could have been prevented by vaccination had they been more accessible and affordable , Weber said . 
`` Price is one dimension , but it is a vital one . 
You need to have an affordable vaccine , that 's one of the strategies we are accelerating , '' he said . 
GSK opened a $ 411 million plant in Singapore this month , its second site producing vaccine against pneumonia-causing bacteria . 
It will take up to two years to test the new plant before commercial production starts . 
The other site is in Belgium . 
Since the H1N1 outbreak began in April , the governments of Australia , New Zealand , Taiwan and Singapore have bought GSK 's Relenza flu treatment , Weber said . 
GSK said it has advised governments to buy and stock more of Relenza , which is used to treat flus such as the H1N1 virus that is spreading across the globe , for a more effective response in dealing with a viral outbreak . 
`` There have been some publications showing that there is some level of resistance developed for Tamiflu , '' Weber said of the product made by competitor Roche -LRB- ROG . 
`` In case there will be more resistance to Tamiflu , Relenza will be a good alternative . '' 
GSK is also developing vaccine against the H1N1 flu virus , which is reported to have killed 306 worldwide and infected at least 67,000 as of June 26 . 
The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- earlier this month declared the first flu pandemic of the 21st century and advised governments to prepare for a long battle against H1N1 .

2009-06-30,"Fergus Walsh | 08:17 UK time , Tuesday , 30 June 2009 I 've been investigating news emerging from Denmark of a case of resistance to the antiviral Tamiflu - the main weapon against H1N1 swine flu . 
If a resistant strain of H1N1 swine flu starts circulating it would be a concern . 
Britain has invested a huge amount in its stockpile of Tamiflu and will eventually have enough to treat eight in 10 of the population . 
If it does n't work in many people that would be a setback , but remember that the vast majority of people who 've been infected with H1N1 swine flu have had a self-limiting illness and have overcome it without antivirals . 
If resistance emerges it would also mean that the virus is mutating -LRB- as all flu viruses do -RRB- and there may be questions about what other surprises it might have in store in the months ahead . 
So what actually happened in Denmark ? 
David Reddy , Roche 's pandemic taskforce leader , said although Tamiflu-resistant isolates had been obtained from a patient it looks as though this was drug-induced . 
This means that the virus developed resistance while the patient was taking Tamiflu . 
There were other patients in the same cluster outbreak and no resistance to Tamiflu was found in any of them . 
The phenomenon of drug-induced resistance is quite different from having a Tamiflu-resistant strain in circulation . 
By contrast there has been a Tamiflu-resistant strain of H1N1 seasonal flu in circulation since 2008 . 
`` There is no sign yet of a Tamiflu resistant strain -LRB- of H1N1 swine flu -RRB- circulating '' said Mr Reddy . 
`` We fully expect to see more cases where the virus may begin to develop resistance while people are taking the drug . '' 
This is the statement that Roche has put out : Roche is providing comment on the report of an oseltamivir resistant isolate of an influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- obtained from a single patient in Denmark . 
Roche reiterates that such resistant isolates in people on the drug is to be expected , as resistance at a rate of 0.4 % and 4 % was observed in adult and paediatric populations respectively in the phase III studies . 
-LRB- 1 -RRB- It is therefore expected that in some patients receiving antiviral medication , resistant virus will emerge . 
However , it is important to note that this does not mean that the currently circulating pandemic influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus is resistant . 
Ongoing testing shows that other currently circulating pandemic virus remains susceptible to Tamiflu . 
Communications from Denmark indicated that this was not unexpected and was not a reason to change recommendations on the use of Tamiflu . 
WHO recommendations remain unaltered . 
In addition to monitoring by government agencies , WHO and other public institutions , Roche recently initiated the global Influenza Resistance Information Study -LRB- IRIS -RRB- , which will include 1,200 patients per influenza season from 2008-2011 and will assess the clinical impact of naturally-occurring and drug-induced resistance to antiviral drugs . 
Roche also continues to support the activities of the Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network .

As weapons get bigger , more powerful and more damaging to environments , is n't it ironic that something so tiny as a virus could ultimately dominate our lives . 
The virus is an organism that has a much quicker replication time than us and therefore is able to adjust itself to what we throw at it , over a rapid period of time . 
If we go all out to destroy the mechanism for virus replication we may inadvertently cause our own ability to replicate , to diminish . 
Last night I watched the film , Children of Men , and the follow up discussion , and have come to the conclusion that we as a species , are long overdue for a change of attitude . 
Whilst I can think of many possible ways that our human existance -LRB- at least as we currently understand it -RRB- may be under threat - e.g. global warming , peak oil , abuse of political powers , abuse of financial powers , revolution , war , terrorism and a whole raft of differing health risks , including some that we thought we had dealt with once and for all -LRB- e.g. TB -RRB- - I 'm just not putting this particular flu variant that near the top of the list . 
Rightly or wrongly , my guess is that humans will , in some way or other , remain the ` dominant species ' for a long time to come . 
Having said that with all this dry weather , as a hay fever sufferer , I 'm beginning to wonder if grass might turn out to be the dominant species !

As mosquitoes interact with birds and horses and other animal life the transfers are only known upon arrival , West Nile , dengue and other known virus ' are also becoming more frequent in some countries . 
It may not be just one virus , it may be a couple or more that become active .

I think your comments might be somewhat more relevant to those traveling abroad , especially to parts of the globe where there are mosquitoes .

The migration routes of birds overlap in many places and therfore virus ' can spread great distances in short periods of time . 
The Black Plague came from Asia and apparently came to Europe through Italy and in the end killed a quater of the population , transported mainly by animals . 
History records these events and each generation has felt safe and yet it tends to repeat , so far with less devastation . 
I only suggest that people be aware of the possibilities . 
What we do know is that there could be a new virus or an existing virus can mutate into a more dangerous form .

Roche also continues to support the activities of the Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network . 
-LRB- 1 -RRB- Aoki FY , Boyvin G and Roberts N. Influenza virus susceptibility and resistance to oseltamivir . 
Antivir Ther 2007 ; 12:603 -616 The sun has been shining , the temperature rising , and it really does feels like summer . 
So it 's not the traditional time one would expect a flu virus to flourish . 
UV light cooks the viral goose pretty quickly , and people are outside more , rather than being huddled together swapping germs -LRB- let 's not spoil this theory by mentioning air conditioning or public transport -RRB- . 
But the H1N1 swine flu virus is not like seasonal flu . 
It 's sufficiently novel and contagious that it is continuing to spread despite the warmer weather . 
Let 's look at what 's happening in the UK and USA . 
The number of cases of swine flu in the UK has doubled in a week . 
Laboratory confirmed cases stand at 4,322 . 
England saw its biggest daily increase today with 535 new cases , most of them coming because of a surge in London and the west Midlands . 
Both areas now have more cases than the whole of Scotland , where the virus continues to flourish in the Glasgow area . 
With the virus now very firmly established in London , it 's likely that further big increases will follow . 
And remember that many cases are going unreported . 
Does that mean a peak in cases - a full-blown national epidemic - will come earlier than expected , perhaps in late August or September ? 
Possibly , but the expectation is that once the school holidays begin , there could be a pause with a peak coming from autumn onwards . 
Then we could see tens of thousands of cases a week and every part of the UK will be affected . 
At present , in Wales , north-east and north-west England , there 's still hardly any flu at all , so the virus is still not fully embedded here . 
Now to the United States . 
The CDC in Atlanta has given another of its very helpful briefings to journalists . 
Dr Anne Schuchat set out the situation there : 27,717 laboratory-defined cases with more than 3000 hospitalisations and 127 fatalities . 
`` This virus is not going away , '' she said , `` and the reported cases are the tip of the iceberg . 
We are estimating there have been at least one million cases in the United States - not perfectly accurate but a ball-park figure . '' 
That estimate is based on some telephone polls asking people whether they 'd had flu-like symptoms in the past three weeks -LRB- not the most accurate way of estimating illness -RRB- and some community surveys which suggested 6 % of people in hot-spot regions may have had the virus . 
While not terribly accurate , the CDC appears confident that at least one million Americans have been infected . 
If so , that is very reassuring news because it means the fatality rate is really very low . 
North America is about a month or so ahead of the UK with its outbreak so what happens there is a good guide to what may happen here . 
So who is getting H1N1 swine flu in the US ? 
Dr Schuchat said the virus was affecting mainly younger people rather than the elderly and made these points : -LRB- 1 -RRB- nearly 80 % of those hospitalised have been under 50 ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- average age for hospitalisation is 19 ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- average age for those who 've died is higher , at 37 ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- about 75 % of those who have died have had underlying health conditions ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- there have been very few cases in people over 65 , so they are very unlikely to be infected - but when they do get it , elderly people have a higher risk of complications and death . 
So how mild is mild and what sort of symptoms do people have ? 
Dr Schuchat said that most had a fever and respiratory symptoms , a cough , a cold , with some having diarrhoea . 
People may be miserable in bed for a few days , but the illness clears up on its own . 
The US , unlike the UK , has restricted antivirals to those at most risk of complications , so comparatively few doses of Tamiflu have been handed out . 
The CDC ca n't say yet how many people are asymptomatic - that is , the number of people that have such mild illness they do n't even realize they 've had swine flu - but with a million plus Americans thought to have had swine flu , it must be a pretty sizeable number . 
A minority can have a much tougher time , according to Dr Schuchat : `` It 's important for everyone to be aware of the virus , and especially for those with underlying health conditions , asthma , diabetes , chronic lung disease , and pregnant women : these people need to be especially concerned if they develop a fever and respiratory illness . '' 
Some mention has been made of obesity being a risk factor . 
Dr Schuhat said that those who were obese , and especially the morbidly obese -LRB- those with a Body Mass Index , or BMI , above 40 -RRB- often have chronic lung disease , and that 's why they were at risk of complications . 
Being obese on its own does not seem to be a risk factor . 
To sum up : swine flu is here to stay . 
For the vast majority it is nothing to worry about . 
For a small minority , it can cause serious illness . 
It should neither be dismissed out of hand nor should it be a reason for panic . 
Scientists must continue to monitor the virus to see whether it mutates or becomes more virulent or becomes resistant to antivirals ; thankfully , there 's no sign of those at present . 
A briefing by the chief medical officer for England Sir Liam Donaldson and the new Health Secretary Andy Burnham yielded some interesting new thinking on H1N1 swine flu .

If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content . 
Let 's start with antivirals . 
At present , everyone in the UK who is suspected of having H1N1 swine flu is offered them . 
But the virus is proving so mild that it has got health officials wondering whether this really is a sensible policy . 
The Department of Health , like global health bodies , was expecting the next pandemic to be a more aggressive virus with a higher mortality rate . 
There are plenty of antivirals to go round - enough Tamiflu -LRB- and the lesser-known Relenza -RRB- for half the population , and eventually for eight in ten people in the UK . 
Sir Liam Donaldson said that he 'd asked scientists to look into the issue . 
`` People with seasonal flu do n't get antivirals , '' he said . 
`` Should we be treating only those who are at higher risk of complications ? '' 
It would represent a big shift in policy on Tamiflu . 
Already , some of those offered the drug are turning it down because they do n't see the point in taking it when they have only mild symptoms or are simply a close contact of someone infected , or because they want to avoid possible side-effects like nausea . 
But before people say that the whole pandemic issue has been a lot of fuss over very little , a word of caution . 
Sir Liam pointed out that they were working on the basis of three potential scenarios for this autumn and winter : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the virus is largely unchanged and remains mild ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- it changes and becomes more severe -LRB- bear in mind that all flu viruses mutate , which is why we need a new seasonal flu vaccine each winter -RRB- ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- and the least likely option , says Donaldson -RRB- it combines with another virus subtype and a new strain emerges . 
If -LRB- 2 -RRB- or -LRB- 3 -RRB- occurs , then the pandemic would become more serious . 
Another topic that came up was vaccines . 
Sir Liam said the government hoped to get the first doses of H1N1 vaccine in August . 
By the end of the year , we were told , there might be 60 million doses , enough for about half the population , based on the assumption that each person would need two jabs . 
Sir Liam said there was a `` cookery book element '' to vaccine production , which I took to mean that the yield and dosing strategy varied from year to year . 
As a result , we ca n't yet be sure when we will get all the vaccine . 
Another issue , not discussed , is that the UK is just one of many countries which has contracts for vaccine , and there will be pressure from all governments to get their doses first . 
Another issue that the government must grapple with is who to vaccinate first . 
Sir Liam said that they had to strike a balance between protecting people at higher risk and targeting the vacine to slow the spread of the virus . 
The latter could be done by vaccinating everyone in outbreak areas . 
But Sir Liam indicated it was more likely that at-risk groups would be protected first . 
Nothing was said about front-line health workers , but I would expect this group to be among the first to be immunised . 
Andy Burnham said that , as with all such issues , they would be `` led by the science '' . 
Mr Burnham pointed out that the vaccine contracts would eventually supply 130 million doses . 
But officials ca n't yet say when all the jabs will arrive . 
It 's quite possible that millions of Britons will encounter the virus before they are offered a vaccine - it all depends on what happens this autumn . 
But Sir Liam pointed out that the vaccine will be useful even after this autumn : `` In all previous pandemics , excess mortality has occured for three years after the virus appeared '' . 
Finally , how do you know what will happen if you , your child or a friend feels ill with suspected swine flu ? 
The answer is : it depends entirely on where you live . 
In parts of London , the west Midlands and east Berkshire -LRB- all swine flu `` hot spots '' -RRB- , there is a shift away from containment towards `` outbreak management '' because there are so many cases in the community . 
I will set out the three phases involved in managing the outbreak in the UK : Containment phase : this is still be used in many areas where there are few cases . 
Contacts of infected people are traced and offered antivirals , schools may be closed and all those suspected of infection are tested via nasal and throat swabs , to produce a laboratory diagnosis . 
In this phase , it is the Health Protection Agency that takes the lead . 
Outbreak management phase : this is the policy in hotspots . 
Only a small proportion of suspected cases will be swabbed -LRB- so that the HPA can keep tabs on the spread of the disease -RRB- and instead , GPs will do clinical diagnosis . 
Schools are unlikely to close . 
Contacts are not traced and Tamiflu might be restricted only to those with suspected infection . 
Areas will change to this policy once the virus is spreading widely in their community . 
Each area might adapt the policy to suit their local circumstances - `` flexibility '' is the buzzword . 
Treatment phase : this will be a UK-wide policy , according to Sir Liam . 
He suggested it would be triggered when there were `` west Midlands-style outbreaks in five parts of the country '' . 
The NHS takes the lead instead of the HPA and it 's treated a bit like a large outbreak of seasonal flu . 
But the aim would be to take pressure off GPs and to encourage people to use a telephone line to report symptoms . 
Those who are thought to have the virus will get a unique number which will allow a `` flu friend '' to collect antivirals from a collection point - which may not be a traditional pharmacy . 
The HPA willl keep tabs on the virus and check if it is changing or developing resistance to antivirals . 
The huge increase in cases of H1N1 swine flu in the west Midlands has led to a sudden rush of the `` worried well '' to casualty . 
The Heart of England NHS Trust , which runs three big hospitals , says it has had to set up sectioned-off areas in casualty to deal with people who fear they have the H1N1 virus . 
At Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham , up to 100 extra people a day are turning up at casualty , which is something like a 25 % increase as compared to usual . 
The hospital is having to tie up medical staff to assess the influx of supposed swine flu cases . 
Anyone who does not have a fever - a temperature of over 38 degrees - plus two other symptoms -LRB- such as cough , headache or diarrhoea -RRB- is being sent home . 
Many simply have a cough , a cold , or are feeling a bit `` under the weather '' . 
For a minority with obvious symptoms of the virus , the staff performs swab tests , and then sends those patients home as well . 
Dr Tony Bleetman , a consultant in the emergency department , says that if you do have the virus , you should n't be going to hospital , where you may spread the disease : `` Even if they have swine flu , it 's mostly behaving like the common cold and we would n't expect people to come to hospital with that . '' 
If you have concerns , the advice is to contact NHS Direct . 
But Dr Bleetman says that many of those turning up have done that : `` The problem is that significant numbers are being sent to us after consultation with NHS Direct and we think that NHS Direct are too quick to send people to hospital . '' 
The problem began last week as the number of cases in the west Midlands began to soar . 
The Trust has appealed to `` swine flu locals '' -LRB- as they phrase it -RRB- to stay away . 
I 've mentioned the problem of the worried-well before . 
It is a real concern of the WHO that the anxious should not clog up hospital emergency rooms during a pandemic . 
Imagine if what 's happening in the west Midlands gets repeated at hospitals across the UK as the virus spreads . 
What 's interesting is that the worried well have not been a problem in Scotland , where there was a peak in swine flu cases a few weeks ago . 
The Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS which covers a region of two dozen hospitals , told me that they had not noticed any sudden influx at casualty . 
Bear in mind that Scotland has had the only death from swine flu . 
Maybe the public health messages have been more effective there . 
Or perhaps there are simply more `` worried well '' -LRB- or , as harsher observers term them , hypochondriacs -RRB- south of the border . 
A sharp increase in the global number of cases and deaths can been seen in the latest figures from the World Health Organisation . 
The total now stands at 52,160 laboratory-confirmed cases including 231 deaths in around 100 countries and territories . 
Beware any attempt to derive a `` death rate '' from such figures -LRB- which , by my reckoning , would come out as four deaths in every 1,000 people infected -RRB- . 
As has been repeatedly pointed out , the vast majority of cases go unrecorded , so the figure of 52,160 is a huge underestimate of the actual numbers . 
Work is clearly needed to get a more accurate figure for the mortality and morbidity -LRB- ill-health -RRB- associated with the virus . 
England has also seen a series of big daily increases in lab-confirmed cases in recent days . 
There were 204 new cases confirmed by lab tests today ; the total number in England has doubled in just five days , with the West Midlands accounting for half of all infections . 
The vast majority of those infected have experienced mild flu-like symptoms and fully recovered . 
There have been no deaths in England and one in Scotland . 
The graphs below will show you the figures for the six countries worldwide with the biggest case-loads , in descending order : United States , Mexico , Canada , Chile , UK , Australia . 
The CDC in Atlanta has held another useful briefing on the progress of H1N1 swine flu in the United States . 
Since the US is the global center of the outbreak with far more cases than anywhere else , though fewer deaths than in Mexico , we can learn from that experience about how the virus is behaving now and what may happen in the coming months . 
Dr Daniel Jernigan , Deputy Director of the Influenza Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made these comments : `` The U.S. will likely continue to see influenza activity through the summer , and at this point we 're anticipating that we will see the novel H1N1 continue with activity probably all the way into our flu season in the fall and winter . 
The amount of activity we expect to be low , and then pick up later . 
In terms of the numbers of infections that have been laboratory confirmed as H1N1 , there are now more than 17,800 of those in the United States , including around 1,600 that have been hospitalized and 44 that have died . 
As we have been saying all along , these numbers are likely an underestimate of the number of cases that are out there . 
There are some surveys that indicate that the amount of disease in the areas that are having activity with H1N1 is perhaps around 7 % of the population reporting symptoms due to influenza-like illness . 
The virus continues to impact mostly younger people . 
So far it is not causing significant illness and death in the elderly like we would see with seasonal influenza . 
And the symptoms that are being reported are consistent with influenza , that being predominantly fever , cough , some shortness of breath , fatigue and chills . 
There is some vomiting and diarrhea that have been associated with cases of this infection . 
Everyone needs to be alert to the symptoms of the illness , and especially if you have underlying conditions , such as asthma , diabetes and heart disease . '' 
For me , the 7 % figure jumps out . 
That would mean many millions of cases in the US already , and would be good news because it would mean that the risk of serious illness or death -LRB- already small -RRB- was even lower . 
Earlier CDC estimates reckoned that 19 out of 20 cases were going undetected . 
Jon Cohen from Science Magazine put this question : `` Jon Cohen : Dr. Jernigan , you said there might be as many as 100,000 Americans infected . 
With the finding that 7 % had influenza-like illness in affected communities , that extrapolates to 20 million Americans . 
Could you give an estimate that 's more up to date than the 100,000 ? 
`` Dan Jernigan : `` Well , the 100,000 , as you know , is a rough generalization to try to give a sense of the magnitude of infections that might be there relative to the numbers of laboratory confirmed that we actually had . 
And so as you can see , in some areas , where there have been a lot of transmissions , like New York City , they 're finding maybe around 7 % of the community was infected , or had influenza-like illness . 
There 's some other parts of the U.S. where some of our preliminary data suggests the same thing . 
I think it would be inaccurate to try and take an attack rate of 7 % or an area that 's highly affected and apply that to the U.S. population . 
Because as we all know , the amount of disease is different in different parts of the U.S. And so clearly there are hundreds of thousands of cases that have occurred in the U.S. . 
We are working to get a very good estimate of that . 
But at this point , it would be incorrect to take that percent and apply it to the U.S. '' So the CDC clearly does n't yet have a clear idea of the true number of cases in the US beyond saying that there have clearly been hundreds of thousands . 
One final quote from Dr Jernigan on those who are most at risk of complications responding to a question from Emma Hitt at MedScape : `` Dan Jernigan : Your question is , what numbers of individuals that are hospitalized have underlying diseases , and about 70 % have some kind of underlying disease . 
The most predominant of that is asthma . 
The second being diabetes . 
Immunocompromised status , either through cancer chemotherapy or other compromising conditions is about 13 % . 
And chronic underlying heart disease . 
The things that we see normally as underlying diseases that are associated with increased influenza risk are the same that we 're seeing with H1N1 . '' 
Cases seem to be declining in New York , one of the worst affected areas . 
For those interested in the impact on health and hospitalisations in the city , there is more detail available from the NYC Department of Health . 
A further sign of the spread of H1N1 swine flu in the UK has come with news that many patients in Birmingham who exhibit symptoms will no longer have laboratory tests to confirm the disease . 
Instead , doctors will rely on clinical diagnosis -LRB- in other words , a simple physical examination -RRB- . 
The west Midlands has just over half of all the confirmed cases of swine flu in England . 
Furthermore , in the areas of significant community spread in Birmingham , antivirals will be restricted to high risk and immediate contacts and household members , rather than everyone that an infected person may have been in contact with . 
This is exactly what was announced last week in Scotland regarding the outbreaks in Glasgow and Paisley . 
It 's entirely unsurprising , and a common-sense response once there are significant levels of transmission . 
One hundred and ten further patients under investigation in England were confirmed as having swine flu through laboratory testing today , together with 22 in Scotland . 
This brings the official total since April to 1,784 . 
The real figure will be significantly higher . 
The vast majority have had a mild illness with no complications . 
There are currently six people in hospital in Scotland who have the virus . 
Before the numbers , here are some points to bear in mind . 
First , health officials have been charting the spread of H1N1 swine flu for around seven weeks now . 
Most of the cases mentioned will now be virus-free and healthy . 
Second , the WHO figures lag behind the real total by a couple of days . 
For example , the death toll for the US is quite a bit below the current figures from the CDC . 
But the WHO figures , while out of date , are reliable . 
Third , all the graphs vastly underestimate the actual number of cases . 
The CDC has said that perhaps 19 out of 20 cases go unrecorded , and the state of Victoria in Australia has stopped laboratory testing of uncomplex community cases . 
Given those caveats , I think the figures are useful . 
Global H1N1 swine flu cases First , the global tally from the WHO . 
As of 1700 BST on 15 June 2009 , 76 countries have officially reported 35,928 cases of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection , including 163 deaths . 
Now let 's look at some individual countries . 
The number of confirmed cases in the UK now stands at 1,562 . 
There has been one death , that of 38-year-old Jacqueline Fleming , a mother who gave birth prematurely after contracting the virus . 
Yesterday , it was announced that her son Jack had also died . 
He did not have the virus . 
A further 141 patients were confirmed with H1N1 swine flu in England today -LRB- I think this is a record number for one day in England -RRB- , bringing the total to 952 cases . 
Of the new cases in England , 124 appeared in the west Midlands , where 512 people have been affected by the virus . 
There was one new case in Northern Ireland , bringing the total to nine . 
Three cases have been recorded in Wales . 
Health Protection Scotland said there had been 10 new laboratory-confirmed cases today , taking the total to 508 , with 414 possible cases under investigation . 
17,855 cases and 45 deaths at 15 June . 
This represents a rise of 4,638 cases and 18 deaths since the last report on 12 June . 
6,241 cases and 108 deaths with no cases reported in the last three days . 
This can surely only mean that the figures were not forthcoming or that the authorities are not testing in the community . 
I will try to investigate further . 
Yesterday , the US State Department said that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- had lifted the recommendation that American citizens avoid all non-essential travel to Mexico . 
I 'm going to talk here about the risks associated with getting H1N1 swine flu during pregnancy . 
Although it 's not been officially confirmed , it 's understood that the first person with H1N1 swine flu to die in Britain was a 38-year-old mother who had given birth prematurely . 
The patient , who has not yet been named , was admitted to hospital with swine flu and gave birth earlier this month to a premature baby . 
The child was born at 29 weeks gestation . 
Few details have yet been confirmed by the Scottish authorities ; they have so far said only that the patient had `` underlying health conditions '' . 
Her death is very sad news , and everyone 's thoughts must be with her family , friends and the medical staff who cared for her . 
Before I go on to discuss the elevated risks of swine flu associated with pregnancy , it 's important to stress , as I do repeatedly , that the vast majority of people who contract this virus have a mild disease which lasts a few days . 
Many will have no symptoms at all . 
The official figure for the UK is 1,261 cases and this is the first death . 
But there will have been hundreds - maybe many thousands - of cases which have gone unrecorded . 
So instead of being one death in 1,261 cases , it is undoubtedly a lot less than that . 
With around 700,000 babies born in the UK each year , I know that many women and their partners will be concerned . 
So please be reassured that the vast majority of pregnant women who get infected will be okay , as will their unborn children . 
Having put all those caveats in place , it is true that pregnancy is a risk factor for swine flu . 
The director general of the World Health Organization , Margaret Chan , had this to say about pregnancy last week , in her speech declaring a flu pandemic : `` Without question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . 
This heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' 
But remember that pregnancy is also a risk factor for seasonal flu , especially in the last trimester . 
Flu poses a threat both to the mother and to the unborn child . 
Among the complications , the fever associated with flu can lead to a premature delivery . 
Health advisers recommended three years ago that pregnant women should be among the groups offered a seasonal flu jab . 
When a vaccine for H1N1 swine flu becomes available in the autumn , pregnant women may well be among the first `` at risk '' groups offered the jab . 
What about antiviral drugs and pregnancy ? 
During pregnancy , the concern with any drug is that it may pass through the placenta and affect the baby . 
There is a risk factor especially during the first trimester . 
Oseltamivir -LRB- currently best known as the brand name Tamiflu -RRB- is not usually recommended for pregnant women because the side-effects are unknown . 
But the lesser-known inhaled drug Relenza -LRB- a brand name for zanamivir -RRB- can be prescribed on medical advice , according to the Department of Health . 
`` An expert group reviewed the risk of antiviral treatment in pregnancy , which is extremely small - much smaller than the risk posed by the symptoms of swine flu . '' 
There are more details on pregnancy and swine flu on the government health pages . 
The death of a woman suffering from H1N1 swine flu in Scotland is a sad reminder that this is not always a mild infection . 
This is not only the first confirmed death in Britain , but the first outside of the Americas . 
But it is not a signal that the virus is getting more virulent or that people are at any greater threat . 
The vast majority of the 1,200-plus people who have had the virus in the UK have experienced mild symptoms and then fully recovered . 
Throughout the world , swine flu does present a slightly higher risk to those with existing respiratory illness , asthma , cardiovascular disease and obesity . 
It 's worth remembering that seasonal flu kills several thousand people in the UK each winter . 
The difference with H1N1 swine flu is that the virus is almost exclusively targeting people under 65 . 
It is likely that cases in the northern hemisphere may tail off in the summer months , with a much bigger outbreak in the autumn . 
The virus ca n't be stopped altogether , but everyone can help to slow its spread by observing simple hygiene measures , and by staying home if they get the virus . 
Do you want to avoid catching H1N1 swine flu ? 
You could find a remote , uninhabited island until a vaccine is created . 
I think that 's going a bit far . 
But the best defense is age . 
So far , the over-65s has been the group least likely to catch the infection . 
This has led to me receiving cheery comments from retired people saying that it 's the first time in some while that they 've felt glad to be old . 
So why are n't they falling ill ? 
The likeliest explanation is that they have built up immunity over years of exposure to other H1N1 flu viruses . 
That might also help to explain why most other people get a mild infection . 
But I 'm still puzzled as to why 30 - to 50-year-olds are suffering a disproportionate amount of severe illness . 
In fact , I 'm a bit puzzled as to exactly which age groups - under the age of 65 - are most at risk of severe illness . 
`` We know that the novel H1N1 virus preferentially infects younger people . 
In nearly all areas with large and sustained outbreaks , the majority of cases have occurred in people under the age of 25 years . 
`` In some of these countries , around 2 % of cases have developed severe illness , often with very rapid progression to life-threatening pneumonia . 
Most cases of severe and fatal infections have been in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years . 
This pattern is significantly different from that seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza , when most deaths occur in frail elderly people . 
Many , though not all , severe cases have occurred in people with underlying chronic conditions . 
`` Based on limited , preliminary data , conditions most frequently seen include respiratory diseases , notably asthma , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , autoimmune disorders , and obesity . 
`` At the same time , it is important to note that around one third to half of the severe and fatal infections are occurring in previously healthy young and middle-aged people . 
Without question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . 
This heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' 
This was very similar - up to a point - to the briefing yesterday by the CDC in Atlanta . 
You 'll notice the same emphasis on younger age groups , pregnant women and those with underlying health problems . 
This is what Dr Anne Schuchat had to say about the US experience of H1N1 swine flu : `` It is a very new virus . 
57 % of the cases that we 're having reported to us occur in people five to 24 years of age , and 41 % of the hospitalisations are in that same age group - the older children and young adults . 
But I also want to tell you about the rates , the cases per 100,000 population , and let you know that the highest rates of hospitalization are actually in children under five . 
And the next highest rates are in those people 5 to 24 . 
So it looks like this is a virus that 's disproportionately affecting younger people but there are still lots of infections and hospitalizations in older persons . 
`` According to the US statistics , 71 % of the hospitalized patients have occurred in people who have an underlying condition - respiratory illness like asthma or conic obstructive pulmonary disease , immune deficiencies , and so forth . 
As we have noted , there 's been a disproportionate amount of pregnant women among those who have had infection . '' 
Did you spot the difference ? 
Dr Schuchat made no direct mention of the 30-50 age group , although she did mention that there were lots of people over 24 who are taken to hospital . 
If the 30-50 year group is especially at risk , it would be good to know . 
I 'm still just in that age group myself , so maybe it 's self-interest at work here . 
No doubt all will become clearer in the months ahead . 
When it does , I will let you know . 
There were three in the 20th Century . 
The worst , Spanish flu in 1918 , killed perhaps 50 to 100 million people - but that was before the antibiotic era . 
The pandemics of 1957 and 1968 killed one to two million . 
Even that sounds alarming , but bear in mind that normal seasonal flu contributes to up half a million deaths per year . 
And H1N1 flu is currently so mild that , in terms of deaths , it might not be much worse than a bad normal winter of flu . 
But it is different in the groups it targets . 
Very few elderly people are catching H1N1 flu , probably because they have immunity due to exposure to similar flu viruses . 
Instead , the peak groups are children and young adults aged 5-24 , followed by children under five , and then adults under 50 . 
Most of those who fall seriously ill , with complications like pneumonia , have underlying health problems . 
People will want to know when they are likely to be exposed to H1N1 . 
That 's impossible to say with any accuracy , but the summer months may suppress the virus somewhat in Britain , and it may be the late autumn or beyond before we see a full-scale epidemic in every community . 
The government 's pandemic plans suggest that perhaps a third of the population could get infected , causing huge rates of absenteeism from work , and extra pressure on the health service . 
There is concern that the virus might mutate in the southern hemisphere over its winter and become more virulent , but there 's no sign of that yet . 
A pandemic vaccine is in early development ; it will be autumn before the first doses are ready ; they will be earmarked for front-line health workers and those with health problems . 
Along with Chile and Japan , these are the countries which are forcing the move to Phase 6 , a global epidemic or pandemic . 
Dr Ian Barr is the Deputy Director of the WHO Influenza Centre in Australia . 
He 's based in Melbourne , which is the center of the flu outbreak there . 
The state of Victoria has had more than 1,000 confirmed cases of swine flu and Dr Barr said that the government was now changing the way it managed the outbreak . 
`` If someone is ill then we will continue to ask that they stay at home and do n't go out and risk infecting anyone . 
But there wo n't be a recommendation for quarantining whole families as has happened . 
`` Unless someone falls quite ill they wo n't be given antiviral treatment like Tamiflu and we wo n't trace their contacts . 
We wo n't close schools if there 's a single case , so it 's a much more relaxed approach than we 've had prior to this phase . '' 
But Dr Barr said that the virus was not causing serious problems : `` We 've had just a handful of cases admitted to hospital and no deaths . 
`` There 've been very mild symptoms among the 1,000 laboratory confirmed cases and probably thousands more that have not been tested . '' 
With the southern hemisphere moving into its peak winter flu season , it will be vital to keep a close watch on what happens there in the months ahead . 
Scotland , by contrast , is heading into summer . 
That did not stop 47 new cases being confirmed there today , the highest number for a single day . 
It takes the total to 311 . 
Ten people are in hospital . 
Dr Harry Burns , the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland , said that there was no doubt that they were seeing community transmission well beyond the confirmed cases . 
`` The last figures I saw there were between 30 and 40 cases where there was no known source for the infection - it did not seem to be travel-related or connected to a particular outbreak . 
But sometimes people do n't always remember their contacts '' . 
Dr Burns said that there was also no doubt that there were plenty of cases going untested and unmeasured , just as was happening in other countries . 
I asked him whether it was time for a change in approach as is happening in Australia , with fewer school closures and so on . 
`` We are getting close to a change in strategy , but quite how and when it is rolled out we ca n't say yet . 
We will continue to take scientific advice . 
`` If you have a new travel-related case in a rural part of Scotland where there have been no cases , then you may look for contacts . 
That might be less so in other areas where there have been lots of cases . '' 
He has no doubt that the virus is here to stay and he hoped that it would remain a largely mild infection . 
`` But it 's worth preparing for the worst . 
The nightmare scenario a few years ago was that H5N1 avian flu would reassort with a human flu virus in pigs . 
`` If H1N1 reassorted with H5N1 , it would be important to have some initial protection against the H1N1 strain . 
That 's why it 's worth creating a vaccine . '' 
So it 's now just a question of timing . 
Within a day or so the World Health Organisation will officially declare a pandemic of H1N1 swine flu . 
The move to pandemic Phase 6 will be official confirmation that the H1N1 virus is here to stay and that it will continue to spread globally . 
It must be hoped that the world does not over-react . 
It will probably be months before most of us come into contact with the virus , and when we do , the vast majority will experience mild flu symptoms . 
It is not an indication that the virus is becoming more virulent . 
If those messages can be effectively communicated to the public , it could prevent a lot of unnecessary alarm . 
A key decision concerns vaccines . 
Several manufacturers now have an H1N1 seed virus strain , and will be doing safety and efficacy testing in the coming months . 
We do n't know how well the virus will grow or how many doses people will need to be protected . 
Given the moderate nature of H1N1 it would be inconceivable for the WHO to ask manufacturers to switch completely from production of seasonal flu to a pandemic vaccine . 
More likely is that companies will try to do a bit of both . 
Several countries , including the UK , have contracts to provide enough doses to immunise their entire populations . 
But despite upscaling in production in recent years , there wo n't be enough jabs to go round globally . 
The first bulk doses might be ready in the late autumn and would be earmarked for frontline emergency staff and those with chronic respiratory problems . 
It 's possible that by the time an H1N1 vaccine is ready , the virus will already be spreading rapidly in the northern hemisphere . 
We will learn a lot from what happens in Australia and other southern hemisphere countries in the months ahead . 
So are we over-reacting to swine flu ? 
I do n't believe so . 
Even a pandemic of mostly mild illness will still cause huge disruption to business and society during its peak because it mostly affects those of working and school age . 
Although the vast majority of those infected get mild symptoms , a few get seriously ill . 
The WHO estimates that about half the 140 deaths so far have been in young people who were previously healthy . 
We must also watch out for genetic reassortment - or drift - in the DNA of the virus which might make it more virulent in future . 
There 's no sign of that yet but it 's another reason why we should all take the pandemic seriously , without the need for panic . 
When is a pandemic not a pandemic ? 
When the World Health Organization says so . 
With the virus spreading in Australia , where there 's been a four-fold increase in cases in a week , it might seem surprising that global health officials have not yet moved from the current Phase 5 to 6 , which would mean that a pandemic had been declared . 
Predictions are a mug 's game - but , on BBC TV and radio this evening , I stuck my neck out and said that a pandemic declaration was likely within days , or possibly weeks at the outside . 
The reason for this was that listening to the WHO 's assistant director general Dr Keiji Fukuda in the weekly media briefing , it seemed to me that the WHO was holding back from declaring a pandemic for political reasons . 
I 'm not suggesting anything underhand , but simply that member states and scientists have advised the WHO that it must prepare the ground before making the move to Level 6 . 
The WHO ca n't ignore the surge in cases in Australia , and , to a lesser extent , the leap in cases in the UK and Chile . 
Dr Fukuda said that he feared `` a blossoming of anxiety '' - in other words , panic - if they suddenly declare a pandemic . 
It 's true that the word `` pandemic '' sounds scary . 
But it simply means a global epidemic of an infectious disease . 
It is not a signal that the virus is getting more virulent ; it has nothing to do with severity ; rather , it is a measure of geographical spread . 
And we must remember that the vast majority of people who get H1N1 swine flu have a mild illness . 
Dr Fukuda said that it was fair to say that we are `` really getting close '' to declaring a pandemic , but that the WHO wanted to avoid or reduce the sort adverse actions that had happened when it last raised the threat level , such as the culling of pigs , unnecessary concerns over pork , trade embargoes , travel restrictions and concerns about travellers from certain areas . 
`` These are the kinds of potential adverse effects you can have if you go out without making sure that people understand the situation as well as possible . 
`` In earlier pandemics , we have often seen that people who are worried , but not particularly sick , have over-run hospitals and led to a dsyfunction in the health system because so many are going to emergency rooms , adversely affecting people who really require emergency care . 
We 'd like to minimize the risks of that . '' 
Listening to that , it does seem sensible that the WHO first prepares the ground before moving to Phase 6 . 
The media must play a part here , emphasising the facts about this virus and not over-reacting . 
Governments , too , have a big role to play , ensuring that their pandemic plans are in place . 
And businesses must prepare for the coming of a virus which , even if it is mild , will cause huge numbers of absences from work . 
Remember , though , that when a pandemic is declared , it wo n't make any difference to most of us . 
Different countries will experience local epidemics at different times . 
What matters is when H1N1 begins to spread rapidly within your community , way beyond schools and unrelated to travel . 
Only then might the virus make a tangible difference to your daily life . 
Two experts on infectious disease in Australia say a flu pandemic has effectively already started because of the widespread number of cases there . 
Robert Booy , professor of Child Health at the University of Sydney in New South Wales , urged the World Health Organisation to take action regarding a shift from the current alert phase 5 to the top level , phase 6 : `` The WHO ca n't keep scratching their heads , they have to make a decision , '' he said . 
Professor Booy , who works at the Children 's Hospital , Westmead , said the H1N1 virus was `` unstoppable '' and would continue to spread around the world . 
He expressed surprise that the WHO had not already declared a pandemic - a global epidemic of a new flu strain - because the H1N1 virus `` fulfilled the criteria of community spread '' . 
As yesterday 's post made clear , the WHO has said once we have `` community level outbreaks '' in another region outside the Americas , then a pandemic will be declared . 
This means that the virus must be spreading widely , beyond schools and unrelated to travel . 
Professor Booy said his neighbouring state of Victoria now had so many cases they would no longer be testing people with flu symptoms in the community , but rather limiting the test to those who needed hospital treatment . 
`` We have community transmission in Victoria , '' he said . 
Victoria has by far the bulk of Australia 's swine flu cases . 
The Australian government said that of the country 's 1,211 total confirmed cases , 1,011 had been reported in Victoria . 
The number of cases in Australia have risen four-fold in a week . 
Professor Booy said this was unsurprising . 
`` The cycle of infection is about two days . 
For every one person with the virus , another 1.5 people get infected , so that gets you to a four-fold rise in six to seven days '' . 
Professor Booy said thankfully the virus was causing mostly mild symptoms . 
`` We have had some hospitalisations , and one person in intensive care , but all are doing well , '' he said . 
Fewer than 10 of the flu cases nationwide have required hospital admission . 
There have been no deaths . 
Raina MacIntyre , professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at the University of New South Wales , said according to the WHO 's definition of a pandemic , `` we are in Phase 6 ; technically we are there already . '' 
But she added , `` it 's just a guideline , and when the definitions were devised they did n't factor in severity . 
I think the WHO approach is reasonable given that there would be widespread economic , tourism and trade implications if a pandemic was declared '' . 
Professor MacIntyre explained that the traditional thinking was that a pandemic would be caused by a new haemagglutinin antigen . 
This is one of the surface proteins on the flu virus , and is responsible for it binding to infected cells . 
`` We thought it would be caused by an H5 or an H9 type , rather than H1 which is not really new . 
When you look at the immunological response of the various age groups , people over 65 have a good level of protection , and only people under 18 have no immunity while many young adults have little immunity . '' 
Professor Booy , who helped draw up Australia 's pandemic flu plan said `` We had many assumptions and one was that a new flu virus would cause high mortality caused by something really novel . 
The H1 gene has been with us for centuries . '' 
But he warned that the virus could mutate or `` drift '' in the coming months . 
`` We already know of cases where people have got double infections - both H1N1 and seasonal flu - and that 's what you need for viruses to reassort . '' 
Apologies for constantly updating the figures , but I feel it 's necessary at the moment : first , because the virus is continuing to spread ; second , because of the dramatic surge in cases in the southern hemisphere . 
The World Health Organization 's latest figures show that 73 countries have officially reported 25,288 of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection -LRB- more commonly known as swine flu -RRB- including 139 deaths . 
It 's worth comparing that with figures a week ago , when there were 17,410 cases in 62 countries and 115 deaths . 
It 's interesting to see the surge in cases over the past week in the southern hemisphere , which is entering its winter flu season . 
Australia 's cases have leapt from 297 to 1051 . 
Chile 's cases have jumped from 250 to 411 , with one death . 
The UK has also seen a big increase . 
A week ago , the WHO reported 229 cases ; today it had 557 -LRB- and remember that the WHO figures always lag behind national statistics by a few days -RRB- . 
If you are keeping track of what 's happening in the UK , the more up-to-date figures are these : in Scotland , 43 more cases were announced today , bringing the total there to 232 ; add four cases in Northern Ireland and two in Wales for a total of 664 - please forgive me if my arithmetic fails me at any point . 
10 of the confirmed cases in Scotland are in hospital , including three in intensive care . 
Seven health care workers are now also among the confirmed cases . 
It 's worth stressing yet again that the vast majority of people who have contracted swine flu have got mild symptoms . 
So with 664 confirmed cases in the UK and more than a thousand in Australia , will a pandemic be declared by the WHO - and if so , when ? 
The WHO defines Phase Six : `` Phase 6 , the pandemic phase , is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5 . 
Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way . '' 
You might argue that we are already there . 
But the WHO is looking for what it calls `` sustained disease outbreaks '' in the community . 
We have plenty of these in North America , and are waiting for them to occur in another of the six WHO regions . 
According to Professor Anthony Kessel , Director of Public Health Strategy at the Health Protecgtion Agency , we are not there yet : `` The number of sporadic cases remains under twenty . 
These are confirmed cases of infection , but where there 's no obvious link with travel or a known case '' . 
Professor Kessel said that `` we would need to have a significant number of people where you really do n't know how they have got it , for it to be classified as sustained community transmission . 
We are getting closer to that , but are not there yet . '' 
Finally , a quick update on anti-virals and potential side-effects , which some have asked me about . 
Professor Kessel said that Tamiflu has so far been used mostly for children in the UK because of the outbreaks in schools . 
`` There have been reports of some side-effects , '' he said . 
`` The most common have been nausea and stomach pain , which is in line with the manufacturers ' written warnings . 
At the HPA , we have reiterated the advice that it 's best taken with food , as this seems to help . '' 
Professor Kessel said that when anti-virals were prescribed , the HPA was very clear that this was advisory : `` It 's up to parents and their children together to decide whether or not to take Tamiflu - there is no obligation to comply . '' 
It 's understandable that H1N1 swine flu has made fewer appearances on radio and television bulletins in recent weeks . 
There was massive coverage when the virus first emerged and when the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to five , one short of six when a pandemic is declared . 
But just because swine flu is not getting so much publicity , it does not mean it has gone away . 
Nor does it mean that the risk of a pandemic - a global epidemic of flu - has abated . 
A few figures just released show how cases of swine flu continue to rise . 
Health Protection Scotland has confirmed 22 new cases . 
This includes two doctors at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley , who are thought to have caught it from patients being treated there . 
It brings the Scottish total to 141 including four patients who are in a critical but stable condition . 
The Health Protection Agency in England has confirmed 27 new cases , bringing the total to 363 . 
Northern Ireland and Wales have two cases each . 
It brings the UK total to 508 . 
In the United States the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- has also put out new data which it says it will now update only weekly , on Fridays . 
It has 13,217 confirmed and probable cases and 27 deaths . 
At present the number of confirmed US cases is rising by about 1,000 per day . 
The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- released a new global update earlier today . 
Although it lags behind national statistics , it is still the gold standard for assessing the spread of H1N1 swine flu . 
It reports 21,940 cases in 69 countries including 125 deaths - 103 of these in Mexico . 
Australia has 876 confirmed cases according to the WHO , up from 501 in two days . 
It now has the highest case-load outside North America . 
July and August will be the peak season for flu in Australia and there are signs that the virus is taking hold there very quickly . 
If widespread community outbreaks are reported in Australia -LRB- or the United Kingdom , Chile or Japan in the coming weeks it will be a signal for the WHO to declare a pandemic because the virus will have been shown to be spreading widely in two WHO regions of the world . 
The US has far more cases of H1N1 swine flu than anywhere else so they are beginning to get some more robust statistics which may help in our understanding of how this virus will affect the world . 
Dr Schuchat said there was evidence that flu activity was declining in the nation as a whole , with the start of the summer in North America . 
Young children together with young and middle age adults were those most affected by H1N1 flu . 
Unlike seasonal flu , the virus seems to be sparing the elderly . 
Here are the statistics - the US has : 11,468 probable and confirmed cases of H1N1 swine flu -LRB- it 's worth remembering that laboratory confirmed cases in the US represent only a small fraction of the real total -RRB- 770 people have been hospitalised 60 % of all cases are among people aged 5-24 years 42 % hospitalisations are among people aged 5-24 years Next highest group are children under 5 Very low rates of cases and hospitalisations in people over 65 Dr Schuchat said that the CDC had provided several manufacturers with candidate vaccine virus strains . 
This will enable them to produce pilot lots of vaccine which can be tested for safety and efficacy . 
That will probably take a couple of months . 
At that point , the WHO and CDC will have to make the difficult decision about whether to ask manufacturers to bulk produce an H1N1 pandemic vaccine . 
It 's a difficult call because it would mean reducing the amount of seasonal flu vaccine production . 
Given that manufacturers are mid-way through the production of seasonal flu vaccine for the northern hemisphere this autumn , those stocks are unlikely to be affected . 
It is next year 's immunisation in the southern hemisphere which would probably feel the first impact of any switch to pandemic flu vaccine production . 
Dr Schuchat pointed out that seasonal flu caused around 200,000 hospitalisations in the US each year and about 36,000 deaths , so this was a disease they took very seriously . 
Worst affected are people over 65 . 
She said the CDC would be recommending that the usual at-risk groups get immunised . 
In the US this includes children aged 6 months to 18 years -LRB- a group not targeted in the UK -RRB- , pregnant women , the elderly , those with serious health problems , and anyone who wants to reduce their risk of getting flu . 
I think it 's a safe prediction that there will be a record uptake for the jab later this year . 
So no decision has been made yet about whether to push the button on creating a mass stockpile of H1N1 vaccine in the US , or indeed the world . 
Dr Schuchat said they would await the outcome of test vaccine studies and carefully monitor the epidemiology of the virus . 
A decision , she said , would be made in the early autumn . 
One encouraging fact is that tests of virus samples from around the world have not shown any variations ; in other words , it does n't look like there has been any mutation or drift in its genetic structure . 
How many people in the UK have swine flu ? 
Do you want the official or the unofficial figure ? 
The number of laboratory-confirmed cases stood last night at 404 . 
But there are undoubtedly some cases which have gone undetected . 
Professor John Oxford , a virologist at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , has come up with a figure . 
Speaking this morning on 5 Live Breakfast , he speculated that there could be 20,000 infected people in the UK . 
His theory goes that most of them have had such mild illness , it 's gone undetected . 
I spoke to him afterwards and he stressed that this is a pure `` guesstimate '' rather than a scientific analysis of the figures . 
He stressed that the number was not meant to be alarming - and that quite the contrary , it shows that the virus causes mild symptoms in the vast majority of cases . 
Professor Anthony Kessel , Director of Public Health Strategy at the Health Protection Agency agreed that there are some undetected cases out there , but he did n't think that it was tens of thousands . 
He said that the UK had among the best flu surveillance systems in the world and doubted there could be that many cases . 
That may leave you none the wiser . 
We may get a better idea by looking at what 's happening in the United States . 
There , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website says that there have now been 11,054 confirmed and probable cases . 
But it has also repeatedly stated that possibly 19 out of 20 cases are going undetected . 
As I said in a post on Tuesday , this could mean that there are 200,000 or more people in the United States who have been infected . 
So can you simply multiply the current official UK figure of 404 by 20 , giving us around 8,000 cases here ? 
It 's quite a lot less than Professor Oxford 's guesstimate , though still a lot . 
But there are two differences I can think of between the UK and the US which may make that figure lower . 
First , the virus is not as well established here as it is in North America . 
We are seeing cases pop up out of the blue , but most are linked to current outbreaks . 
Second , the UK does have a very well organised flu surveillance service , one of the features of our GP network set within a national health service . 
Contrast that with the fragmented healthcare on offer in the US and it 's little wonder that surveillance here is likely to be better . 
All that probably means that fewer cases are going undetected here than in the US . 
Whether it 's a few hundred or many thousands though , it 's impossible to say . 
A nurse in Scotland has become the first health worker in the UK to catch swine flu . 
The 26-year-old , who works at a Glasgow hospital , had been treating a patient who is now in intensive care with the virus . 
The details were given by the Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon . 
The nurse is now recovering at home . 
There are now four people , critical but stable with swine flu , in hospitals in Glasgow and Paisley . 
A 23-year-old woman from Paisley was admitted today . 
Initially , it was thought that she had no underlying health problems , but Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board later ascertained that this is not the case . 
It was only a matter of time before Africa recorded its first case of H1N1 swine flu . 
AFP reported that a 12-year-old girl who 'd traveled from the United States has been confirmed as Egypt 's first case of swine flu . 
A government statement said that no other passengers on the flight showed signs of infection . 
Egypt has also had sporadic cases of H5N1 avian influenza , the latest reported yesterday . 
Of the 78 cases of H5N1 reported , 27 have been fatal . 
Thankfully , H5N1 is very hard to catch and almost always requires direct contact with infected poultry . 
It is not an infectious human disease like H1N1 . 
What the world is most anxious to avoid is the two viruses mixing . 
I 've just finished listening to the now-weekly press briefing on H1N1 swine flu given by the World Health Organization in Geneva and here are some of the main points . 
Dr Keiji Fukuda , WHO 's Assistant Director-General , said that the virus had now reached 64 countries with 18,965 laboratory-confirmed cases and 117 deaths . 
`` We are getting closer to phase six , '' said Dr Fukuda , which would mean that a pandemic had occurred . 
He divided the global outbreak into three types : countries in North America where virus spread is advanced - Mexico , the United States and Canada ; the group of countries - which he described as being `` in transition '' , some in Europe , some in Asia , also Australia - where a larger number of cases is occurring , many linked to institutions ; countries where there is no real evidence of spread into communities and cases are largely travel-related . 
Dr Fukuda said that the countries in transition are moving towards community-type spread and include the UK , Spain , Japan , Chile and Australia . 
`` But we are still waiting for evidence of widespread community activity , so that 's why we are not in phase six yet '' . 
He went on to say that the WHO was choosing not to describe the outbreak as mild . 
`` This infection can be fatal - in those who have underlying medical conditions , pregnant women and in some people who were otherwise healthy . '' 
And he said that we do n't know what will happen in the southern hemisphere in the coming months , or in the northern hemisphere later in the year . 
The severity of the outbreaks , he said , would vary from location to location , according to the vulnerability of populations and their preparedness . 
I asked Dr Fukuda which age groups were most likely to catch the virus and to die from it . 
`` The majority of people who have got infected are under 60 years of age , although some people over 60 have also got infected , '' he said . 
`` Those who have got severely ill - with complications such as severe pneumonia and those who have died - have tended to be younger to middle age adults aged 20-40 or so , but not exclusively . '' 
That ties in with the pattern one might expect from a flu pandemic . 
Normal seasonal flu tends to hit the elderly most severely ; in pandemics , it is often young adults who are worst affected . 
As yet , neither person has any known links to other cases , to travel or to each other . 
The man is believed to be the first person in Britain to be taken critically ill , suffering only from swine flu . 
The woman is said to have underlying health problems as does a third patient , a 38-year-old man , who was admitted to intensive care at a hospital in Glasgow last week . 
If you ask most people where you are most likely to catch H1N1 swine flu , my guess is they would answer , Mexico . 
That was the case initially , but has not been for some time . 
Although most deaths from the virus have been in Mexico , it 's the United States which has been the center of the global outbreak for several weeks now . 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- CDC H1N1 Flu website has reported 10,053 probable or confirmed cases of swine flu , up from nearly 9,000 on Friday and 17 deaths . 
Furthermore , the virus has spread to all 50 states . 
In one sense that would be worrying , as it would indicate that H1N1 is well and truly here to stay and that a pandemic is almost certain . 
But it would also confirm that the virus is causing mostly very mild illness , and mean that the death toll from a pandemic might be no worse than with seasonal flu . 
Remember though that scientists are still learning about the virus and are unsure how any pandemic might The World Health Organisation says the global number of confirmed cases of H1N1 is 17,410 in 62 countries , including 115 deaths . 
Since then , Bulgaria and Luxembourg have confirmed their first cases of the disease . 
One of the UK 's leading flu experts has predicted that a pandemic of swine flu is likely to strike Britain in the autumn . 
Professor John Oxford , an expert on virology at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , says that children going back to school , universities reopening and people going back to work after the summer break would give swine flu the `` opportunity '' that it needs to spread . 
Another fifteen cases of swine flu were confirmed yesterday by the Health Protection Agency , bringing the UK total to 244 . 
One of the cases was in Wales and is believed to be the first there . 
But Professor Oxford thinks that many cases are going undetected : `` Already , sporadic cases in the UK have been shown that are not linked with cases that have traveled . 
That does suggest that the virus is silently spreading around . '' 
However , he said that people should behave as usual , as far as possible , if a pandemic strikes . 
`` What we do n't want is people stopping at home and not going to work , because then you have an economic problem on top of a pandemic , '' he said . 
`` The best advice is to carry on as normal but to be sensible about it . 
`` This includes a bit of social distancing and shielding people from coughs by coughing into the crux of your arm . '' 
Professor Oxford said that in the next few months , global health officials will be keeping a close eye on what happens to the H1N1 swine flu virus in countries like Australia and South Africa . 
The southern hemisphere is entering its winter and the peak period for flu . 
On Friday , the World Health Organization reported that Australia has had 147 confirmed cases ; Argentina has had 37 ; and none so far in South Africa . 
What happens in the southern hemisphere in the coming months will be a good indicator of how the virus will behave in Europe and North America later this year . 
There would be particular concern if H1N1 mutated substantially to become a more virulent illness . 
Thankfully , there are no signs of that yet . 
The Australian Science Media Centre is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know what experts are thinking about the spread of the virus there .

2009-06-30,"Imran Ahmad said his daughter had `` been through a lot '' A six-year-old girl who died after contracting swine flu had `` been through a lot '' with other illnesses , her father has told an inquest . 
Sameerah Ahmad died at Birmingham Children 's Hospital on Friday evening after contracting the virus . 
Her father Imran Ahmad , from Edgbaston , attended the opening of the inquest at Birmingham Coroner 's Court . 
The hospital 's Dr Gale Pearson told the court that Sameerah had a condition which had weakened her immune system . 
Her death is the third swine-flu related fatality in the UK . 
The other two were in Scotland . 
There must be a lot of parents who are worried and are very aware of your grief The Health Protection Agency confirmed on Tuesday there are now 6,538 cases in the UK . 
Aiden Cotter , Birmingham and Solihull 's coroner , confirmed Sameerah had been infected with the H1N1 virus when she died and gave details of other serious health problems . 
She was born with a rare genetic disorder affecting the small intestine called microvillus inclusion disease , which causes severe and often life-threatening diarrhoea , the inquest heard . 
A post-mortem examination was due to be carried out on Tuesday and the inquest was adjourned . 
Sameerah 's body was released to her family on Tuesday afternoon and her coffin was taken to the family home where relatives and teachers from her school paid their respects . 
A rare genetic disorder of the small intestine Causes chronic , severe diarrhoea in newborn babies , which can lead to serious dehydration and a condition called metabolic acidosis Nearly always fatal , but can sometimes be treated by intravenous feeding or an intestinal transplant The six-year-old attended Mayfield School , a school for children with special needs in Lozells , Birmingham , which has been closed until Monday . 
Mr Ahmad told the court his daughter had suffered during her lifetime . 
Asked if he wanted a post-mortem examination to be carried out , he replied : `` Obviously I do not , because she has been through a lot already in her life . '' 
However , he said he accepted it , if it was `` the law '' . 
Mr Cotter told him a post-mortem examination was necessary to find out how his daughter had died , but was not strict law . 
`` It may be that , when we have all the evidence in , we still wo n't know but it 's important we try and find out , '' the coroner said . 
Mr Cotter said he was releasing more information about Sameerah 's death than was usual at the opening of an inquest . 
`` I think it 's very important that the public have this information . 
`` There must be a lot of parents who are worried and are very aware of your grief . '' 
Mayfield School head teacher Paul Jenkins said pupils and staff were being offered support over the death of Sameerah . 
`` She was a wonderful , happy , child and her death is a great loss to the school community . 
She will be sadly missed by everyone here . ''

2009-06-30,"First swine flu fatality in Spain More than 700 people have been infected with swine flu in Spain A 20-year-old Moroccan woman infected with swine flu has died in Madrid , becoming Spain 's first fatality from the virus and the fourth in the EU . 
The woman , who suffered from asthma , died of a respiratory illness caused by the flu , Spain 's health ministry said . 
She was seven months pregnant when she was admitted to hospital on 15 June . 
She had an emergency Caesarean section on Monday after her condition worsened . 
Her baby is said to be in good health and has not been affected by the virus . 
Since it first appeared in March , 717 people have been infected with the H1N1 virus in Spain , according to the country 's health ministry . 
One person is said to be in a serious condition in a hospital in Catalonia . 
The latest global figures issued by the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- on Monday gave the number of recorded swine flu cases as 70,893 worldwide , with 311 deaths . 
The other three recorded fatalities in the EU have occurred in the UK .

2009-06-30,"No exercise , more than lying around , tied to fat in kids Full Article Only a flight away ? 
Swine flu followed route map By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Tue Jun 30 , 2009 4:18 am IST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Health experts are fond of saying any new disease is just a flight away from anywhere , and a report published on Monday shows the new strain of H1N1 flu followed the airline route map as it spread around the globe . 
The swine flu virus spread first and quickest in March and April in the United States and Canada -- where 80 percent of airline passengers traveled in March and April of 2008 , researchers at St. Michael 's Hospital in Toronto found . 
Dr. Kamram Khan of St. Michael 's and colleagues used International Air Transport Association data for their study . 
They said travel patterns were also similar in 2007 and therefore likely to be similar in 2009 . 
`` This work provides the world with a potent early warning system for emerging infectious diseases , '' Dr. Michael Gardam of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion said in a statement . 
`` Our analysis showed that in March and April 2008 , a total of 2.35 million passengers flew from Mexico to 1,018 cities in 164 countries , '' Khan and colleagues wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine and published at h1n1 . 
Los Angeles had the most travelers , with 221,494 passengers arriving from Mexico in March and April of 2008 . 
New York followed with 126,345 . 
The first non-U.S. city was Toronto , No. 12 , with 44,854 passengers arriving from Mexico . 
The World Health Organization has confirmed 70,893 cases of the new H1N1 swine flu pandemic , with 311 deaths . 
However , U.S. health officials last week said there were likely at least 1 million cases there alone . 
Iraq , Lithuania , Monaco and Nepal all confirmed their first cases on Monday . 
The first cases were detected in two California children in April , but tests showed the first known infections were in Mexico . 
By the time they had identified a new virus , U.S. officials said it had spread too far and too fast to try to stop it . 
Other countries tried measures to slow its spread , but WHO declared a pandemic -- a global epidemic -- this month . 
`` For the first time , we can quickly integrate information about worldwide air traffic patterns with information about global infectious disease threats , '' Khan said . 
`` What this means is that cities and countries around the world can now respond to news of a threat earlier and more intelligently than ever before . '' 
The researchers said the United States receives more than 76 million international visitors from around the world every year and the United States and Canada together generate and receive about one-sixth of the global volume of international air traffic .

2009-06-30,"School girls wear masks as preventive measures against the H1N1 flu , while walking through a food market in Yangon on June 30 , 2009 . 
GENEVA | Tue Jun 30 , 2009 1:58 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The first H1N1 infection found to be resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu represents an isolated case with no current implications for public health , the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said on Tuesday . 
The United Nations agency has declared a global pandemic is underway from the virus known as swine flu which has so far been treatable with Tamiflu , made by Roche . 
WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said that the discovery of a patient in Denmark whose infection did not respond to the drug , revealed by the Swiss company and Danish officials on Monday , did not amplify the severity of the virus . 
`` This is an isolated case . 
At this time , there is no public health implication . 
But we must remain alert as the virus can change at any time and we must not be complacent , '' he told Reuters . 
Officials say the patient is now well and no further contagion with the resistant virus was detected . 
Resistance to Tamiflu has been previously documented in the deadly bird flu virus H5N1 and seasonal H1N1 flu , Thompson said . 
`` We need to monitor the virus -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- continuously , '' he said , adding that the WHO 's global influenza surveillance network linking laboratories in 97 countries would keep monitoring it . 
`` WHO is not changing its recommendations for the use of antivirals , '' Thompson added , referring to the global body 's advice to its 193 member states . 
The WHO has previously said that the H1N1 virus is sensitive to a class of antiviral drugs which includes Tamiflu , known generically as oseltamivir , and Relenza by GlaxoSmithKline , known generically as zanamivir . 
Denmark 's State Serum Institute said , when making the announcement on Monday , that it was expected that the strain would at some point show resistance to Tamiflu . 
It said that while the patient was found to be infected with a virus strain that had mutated to a form resistant to Tamiflu , the alternative drug Relenza , which is inhaled , remained an effective treatment . 
The WHO on June 11 raised its pandemic flu alert to its highest level of 6 , signifying that the first influenza pandemic since 1968 was under way -LRB- ID : nLC321991 -RRB- Flu viruses mutate regularly and can develop resistance to drugs at any time . 
The WHO has said Tamiflu was working against strains of the new H1N1 flu but some health experts have expressed concern that it might be less effective than Relenza , since there have been widespread reports in the past year of resistance to Tamiflu by seasonal H1N1 flu , a distant cousin of the new swine flu virus . 
David Daigle , a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that the isolated case in Denmark did not merit a change in the recommended use of Tamiflu . 
`` The resistance has not changed the capability of the virus to transmit or cause disease , and the assessment is still that this is a relatively mild influenza , '' he said on Monday . 
At least 20 companies make flu vaccines , including Novartis , Sanofi-Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline , Baxter International , Solvay , Australia 's CSL and nasal spray maker MedImmune , now part of AstraZeneca . 
French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis , which has estimated it makes 40 percent of the world 's supply of flu vaccine , said this month that it had begun large-scale production of a H1N1 vaccine through its Sanofi-Pasteur unit . 
Novartis has said it expects a vaccine to be available by autumn and Baxter International has said it is in full-scale production of a vaccine that could be ready for commercial use as early as July .

2009-06-30,"Rahman Ali -LRB- L -RRB- and Khak Hussain , both deaf and mute villagers , use sign language to communicate with each other at Dadhkai Village in the Doda district , 260 km -LRB- 162 miles -RRB- north of Jammu , June 18 , 2009 . 
DADHKAI , India | Tue Jun 30 , 2009 9:33 am EDT DADHKAI , India -LRB- Reuters Life ! -RRB- 
- Silence reigns in the sleepy village of Dadhkai , nestled high up in the Himalayan mountains in northern India and where the majority of residents are either deaf or mute . 
Each of the 47 families in this village in Jammu and Kashmir state have a least one member who can neither hear nor speak . 
The first reported case dates back to 1931 and now the numbers have swelled to 82 . 
`` The birth of a child is a very happy occasion , meant to be celebrated . 
But here the birth of a child leads to harassment not only for the parents but for the entire village , '' said Hashmiddin , a village elder who only goes by one name . 
`` A deaf and mute child only aggravates problems and increases miseries , '' he told Reuters Television . 
The village with a picture-postcard setting stands in isolation from the rest of the region , as there are no roads , and no transport connecting it to the outside world . 
A river cuts it from the neighboring region . 
Three years ago , a team of scientists and doctors came from an Indian health institute to study the village 's case , but no conclusive findings have been made public so far . 
Some villagers blame it on pollution in the water or air , while others believe they could be cursed , as adjoining villages have not reported any similar disorders . 
But an age-old custom of marrying within the community , coupled with lack of access to medical facilities and immunization , probably led to the large number of deaf and mute cases , says Jan Mohammed , an instructor for the deaf . 
`` I think it is because of a genetic problem , '' Mohammed said . 
`` Close relatives marry here . 
In the past there was no immunization given and also there is a lack of iodine and salt . '' 
Lack of education , and hearing aids , has left many locals disillusioned about the future . 
`` These days it is so difficult to find matches for well educated normal girls , how will I get my deaf and dumb daughters married , '' says Lal Hussain , who has two daughters . 
But there have been a lucky few . 
Bano Begum , who is not hearing impaired , was married to a deaf and mute man and said their relationship was initially a huge struggle as they could not communicated with each other . 
But the couple gave birth to three normal children and learned to communicate with each other through sign language . 
Some experts say the locals should be forced to marry outside their village , which the community rejects . 
India 's Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad recently said another health team would be sent to the village soon .
