2009-06-27,"Jackson death was ` not suspicious ' Medical experts say they are not treating the death of pop star Michael Jackson as suspicious . 
But working out the exact reason for Michael 's death could take several weeks , after doctors ordered tests . 
They want to find out what kind of chemicals might have been in his body when he died . 
Michael Jackson 's body has now been given back to his family but there have n't been any details about his funeral yet . 
Police in the US have also spoken to Michael 's personal doctor , Dr Conrad Murray , who was one of the last people to see him alive . 
A spokeswoman said the doctor was not under criminal investigation , but his car is being examined to see if it contains any medication or evidence that may help find out why Michael died . 
People around the world continue to pay tribute to the star . 
On Friday night thousands of fans came together in London 's Trafalgar Square to light candles and sing some of his biggest hits . 
Often called the King of Pop , Jackson will be remembered as one of the greatest entertainers of all time , having sold more than 250 million albums around the world . 
One of those , Thriller , is still the biggest-selling album ever , selling 61 million copies . 
That 's almost one copy for every single person living in the UK .

2009-06-27,"There has been an outpouring of grief around the world There was no sign of foul play in the death of Michael Jackson , coroners who completed a post-mortem on the singer 's body have said . 
But toxicology and other tests have been ordered , and the cause of the 50-year-old 's death could take several weeks to determine . 
Police also want to speak to Jackson 's doctor who witnessed his collapse . 
Jackson 's body has been released to his family but no funeral details have been made public . 
Michael Jackson 's body moved to an `` undisclosed location '' Seven hours after the post-mortem examination was completed , Jackson 's family was allowed to claim his body , seemingly managing to elude the media crowd outside the coroner 's office . 
The body has been taken to an undisclosed location . 
Announcing the results of a three-hour autopsy , Los Angeles County Coroners spokesman Craig Harvey said there had been no indication of any external trauma or foul play , but he said the cause of death had been deferred . 
`` It means that the medical examiner ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies , '' Mr Harvey said . 
These would take between four to six weeks , he said . 
`` We know he was taking some prescription medication , '' Mr Harvey said , without specifying which . 
Unconfirmed reports suggest the singer had been taking a daily dose of Demerol , a painkiller also widely known as pethidine . 
Same drug class as morphine Given by tablets or injection Used post-surgery or for childbirth High doses can stop breathing or lead to delirium and seizures Jackson , who had a history of health problems , collapsed at his Los Angeles home around midday on Thursday . 
A recording of the telephone call made to emergency services has been released , in which the caller said Jackson was unconscious and had stopped breathing . 
His personal doctor - who witnessed his collapse - was trying to revive him , the caller said . 
The singer was pronounced dead two hours later at the UCLA medical center . 
Jackson 's brother , Jermaine , said he was believed to have suffered a cardiac arrest . 
Former Jackson family lawyer Brian Oxman told US TV that he had been concerned about the star 's use of pain relief medication . 
Born : August 29 , 1958 , Gary , Indiana , US Also known as : The King of Pop , Wacko Jacko Biggest hits : I Want You Back , Do n't Stop Til You Get Enough , Billie Jean , Bad , Black or White , Earth Song He told ABC 's Good Morning America program that Jackson took prescription pain relief for injuries sustained earlier in his career . 
`` It caused him great pain . 
He just did n't like to feel such discomfort . 
He started taking pain medication . 
It became part of his life , '' he said . 
A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department said investigators had briefly spoken to Jackson 's personal doctor , named by US media as Dr Conrad Murray , but they wanted to speak to him again . 
Police also said a car owned by a doctor had been towed away from Jackson 's home . 
A spokeswoman said the doctor was not under criminal investigation , but that the car could contain `` medications or other evidence that may assist the coroner in determining the cause of death '' . 
The star had been due to stage 50 concerts at the O2 arena in London , beginning on 13 July . 
Entertainers , world leaders and fans have continued to pay tribute to the star . 
Across the world , people have been voicing shock and disbelief at the news of his death . 
In Hollywood , thousands of people filed past his star on the Walk of Fame . 
Dr Murray witnessed Jackson 's collapse A White House spokesman said US President Barack Obama considered Jackson a spectacular performer , but said he felt parts of his life were `` sad and tragic '' . 
Former Beatle Paul McCartney described Jackson as a `` massively talented boy-man with a gentle soul '' . 
Jackson began his career as a child in family group The Jackson 5 . 
He went on to achieve global fame as a solo artist with smash hits such as Billie Jean and Bad . 
Thriller , released in 1982 , is the biggest-selling album of all time , shifting 65m copies , according to the Guinness Book of World Records . 
He scored seven UK number ones as a solo artist and won a total of 13 Grammy awards . 
`` For Michael to be taken away from us so suddenly at such a young age , I just do n't have the words , '' said Quincy Jones , who produced Thriller , Bad and Off The Wall . 
`` He was the consummate entertainer and his contributions and legacy will be felt upon the world forever . 
I 've lost my little brother today , and part of my soul has gone with him . '' 
The singer had been dogged by controversy and money trouble in recent years , becoming a virtual recluse . 
He was arrested in 2003 on charges of molesting a 14-year-old boy , but was found not guilty following a five-month trial . 
The star had three children , Michael Joseph Jackson Jr , Paris Michael Katherine Jackson and Prince Michael Jackson II . 
Jackson 's former wife Debbie Rowe is the mother of two of the children , and there is already speculation about who will gain custody of them . 
He is survived by his mother , Katherine , father , Joseph and eight siblings - including Janet , Randy , Jermaine and La Toya Jackson .

2009-06-29,"Doctor ` did not inject ' Jackson Dr Murray is doing all he can to help the inquiry , his spokeswoman says A lawyer for Michael Jackson 's doctor has denied that his client administered painkilling drugs that could have contributed to the singer 's death . 
Edward Chernoff told the Associated Press that Dr Conrad Murray `` had never prescribed Demerol or Oxycontin '' .

He said the star still had a faint pulse and was warm when Dr Murray found him in bed on Thursday afternoon . 
Mr Chernoff said : `` He just happened to find him in his bed , and he was n't breathing . ''

Dr Conrad Murray , who police say is not a suspect , was at Jackson 's mansion and tried to revive him before he died .

Dr Conrad Murray 's lawyer , Edward Chernoff , said officials were looking for the star 's medical records .

He added Dr Murray was present during the search of his home and assisted the officers , who seized mobile phones and a computer hard drive . 
Reports suggest the investigation around Jackson 's death is focusing on his use of powerful painkilling drugs . 
The Drug Enforcement Administration has been involved in the investigation because the agency licenses doctors to administer controlled pharmaceuticals . 
Searches at the clinic and another site rented by Dr Murray in Houston , Texas , were carried out last Wednesday after a warrant was issued by a judge in the city . 
Dr Murray has already been interviewed twice by police The warrant , filed in Harris County District Court , said authorities were looking for `` items constituting evidence of the offence of manslaughter that tend to show that Dr Conrad Murray committed the said criminal offence '' . 
Such charges against a doctor for the death of a patient are extremely rare and require authorities to show there was a reckless action that created a risk of death . 
Items seized during the searches included 27 tablets of the weight loss drug Phentermine , a tablet of the muscle relaxant Clonazepam , two hard drives , notices from the Internal Revenue Service and a registration for controlled substances . 
Police have said Dr Murray is co-operating in the investigation . 
Paramedics were called to Jackson 's Los Angeles mansion while Dr Murray was performing CPR on the singer on the day he died , according to a recording of a 911 call .

`` In fact , Dr. Murray never said that he left Michael Jackson 's room to make phone calls at all . '' 
Mr Chernoff added he would comment on the coroner 's report when it is officially released . 
Details of the Los Angeles County coroners ' findings were revealed when a search warrant affidavit was made public in Houston , Texas , where Dr Murray has offices . 
Dr Murray 's offices were raided last month as part of the police investigation into the singer 's death . 
The coroner 's office has not published its findings regarding the singer 's death . 
According to the affidavit , the LA chief coroner `` had reviewed the preliminary toxicology results and his preliminary assessment of Jackson 's cause of death was due to lethal levels of propofol '' . 
The documents go on to say that Dr Murray told police he had been giving Jackson propofol as part of his treatment for insomnia . 
But , he said he had been concerned Jackson was becoming addicted to the drug and had been trying to wean him off , using alternative drugs . 
But , on the morning of the singer 's death , Dr Murray is reported to have relented and given Jackson a lower dosage of propofol after a number of other drugs had not worked . 
He left the star alone to make some telephone calls and when he returned Jackson was not breathing , the LA Times reports . 
Dr Murray is known to have performed CPR on his patient while the paramedics were called , but Jackson was declared dead when he arrived at hospital . 
Dr Conrad Murray speaking on 18 August : I told the truth Bottles of propofol found in Jackson 's house show it had been prescribed by several doctors , not just Conrad Murray , but he remains at the center of the inquiry , our correspondent adds . 
Earlier this month , Dr Murray - who was employed as Michael Jackson 's personal physician for a series of concerts in London scheduled for July - posted a video message on YouTube to thank his supporters . 
`` I told the truth and I have faith the truth will prevail , '' he said in the short one-minute clip . 
"
2009-08-29,"Michael Jackson died from cardiac arrest in his rented home Michael Jackson 's death was homicide , primarily caused by the powerful anesthetic Propofol , the Los Angeles coroner has confirmed . 
The singer suffered a cardiac arrest at his Los Angeles home in June , aged 50 . 
Propofol and the sedative Lorazepam were the `` primary drugs responsible for Mr Jackson 's death '' , but four further drugs were also found , the report said . 
The coroner 's verdict increases the chances of criminal charges being brought against Jackson 's doctors . 
Police have interviewed his personal physician Dr Conrad Murray but he has not been named as a suspect . 
He has strenuously denied any wrongdoing . 
`` The cause of death was established as acute Propofol intoxication , '' a statement from the coroner said . 
Propofol is normally administered to patients having surgery in hospital . 
A powerful anesthetic usually used before and during surgery Can also be used in small doses to reduce stress or anxiety Produced as a white , opaque fluid and administered intravenously Marketed under the trade name Diprivan `` The manner of death has been ruled : Homicide , '' it adds . 
In the US , homicide refers to the killing of one person by another and includes manslaughter and murder . 
A cocktail of drugs - also including sedatives Midazolam and Diazepam , the painkiller Lidocaine and the stimulant Ephedrine - were detected in his body . 
The full toxicology report remains sealed , at the request of the LA Police Department -LRB- LAPD -RRB- and the city 's district attorney . 
California 's attorney general will now open an independent investigation into several doctors whose names have come up in connection with Jackson 's death . 
David Willis , BBC News , Los Angeles Michael Jackson had apparently been finding it difficult to sleep in the run-up to a series of comeback concerts in London . 
It was Michael Jackson himself who persuaded the company that was promoting his comeback tour to hire Dr Murray , a cardiologist by training , on a salary of more than a $ 150,000 a month . 
Dr Murray has acknowledged administering Propofol and Lorazepam on the day the singer died in an attempt to get him to sleep . 
Dr Murray has denied any wrongdoing but it will now be up to the District Attorney to decide whether to lay charges in this case . 
Dr Murray 's lawyer said the latest information `` contains nothing new '' and demanded that the coroner 's office release the full autopsy report . 
Edward Chernoff said he needed to know the exact levels of the various drugs in Jackson 's system and said the refusal to release the report suggested `` gamesmanship '' . 
`` One has to wonder why the coroner felt compelled to release anything at all if the police investigation is not yet complete , '' he said . 
Dr Murray told police he had been giving Jackson propofol as part of his treatment for insomnia , according to an affidavit made public on Monday . 
The affidavit said Dr Murray had been giving Jackson propofol daily for six weeks but he was concerned that the singer was becoming addicted to the drug and had been trying to wean him off , using alternative drugs . 
Dr Murray told investigators he was not the first doctor to administer propofol to the star . 
On the morning of the singer 's death , Dr Murray is reported to have given Jackson a lower dosage of propofol - on the singer 's insistence - after a number of other drugs had not worked . 
Conrad Murray insists he has done nothing wrong The last time Dr Murray administered the medication was 1040 on 25 June , just hours before Jackson 's heart stopped . 
Dr Murray is known to have performed CPR on his patient while paramedics were called , but Jackson was declared dead when he arrived at hospital . 
Police and federal agents have raided Dr Murray 's offices in Las Vegas , Nevada , and Houston , Texas , and a Las Vegas pharmacy that provided the drugs . 
Jackson 's family welcomed the coroner 's findings . 
`` The Jackson family again wishes to commend the actions of the coroner , the LAPD and other law enforcement agencies , and looks forward to the day that justice can be served , '' the family said in a statement . 
The singer will be buried on Thursday at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale , a suburb of Los Angeles , in a private ceremony . 
The burial was initially scheduled to take place on Saturday - on what would have been Jackson 's 51st birthday . 
"
2009-09-02,"Jackson suffered a cardiac arrest in June Michael Jackson 's death certificate has been amended to reflect his cause of death as homicide . 
The document has been changed to specify that his death was caused by `` injection by another '' . 
Investigators had concluded that a powerful concoction of prescription drugs killed the pop star . 
The coroner 's further homicide verdict increases the chances of criminal charges being brought against Jackson 's doctors . 
Jackson died at his Los Angeles home in June , aged 50 . 
Police have interviewed his personal physician Dr Conrad Murray but he has not been named as a suspect . 
He has strenuously denied any wrongdoing . 
Jackson is expected to be buried in a private sunset ceremony in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in California . 
Only close family and friends of Jackson will be in attendance for the event . 
Meanwhile , a hoax video apparently showing the singer emerging from a coroner 's van has emerged . 
German channel RTL posted the footage on YouTube and received 880,000 hits in one day . 
Heike Schultz , spokeswoman for the network , said it had been an experiment . 
`` We wanted to show how easily users can be manipulated on the internet with hoax videos , '' she said . 
`` Therefore , we created this video of Michael Jackson being alive , even though everybody knows by now that he is dead - and the response was breathtaking . ''

2009-10-01,"The tabloid press had speculated that Jackson was in very poor health Pop star Michael Jackson had a strong heart and was a `` fairly healthy '' 50-year-old , according to an autopsy report obtained in the US . 
His weight was in the acceptable range for a man of his height , according to the Associated Press . 
But the singer , who died of a heart attack in June , had punctured arms , tattooed lips and eyebrows and suffered from lung damage and some arthritis . 
Jackson 's death was ruled as homicide caused by a powerful anesthetic . 
The Los Angeles coroner disclosed in August that Propofol and the sedative Lorazepam were the `` primary drugs responsible for Mr Jackson 's death '' . 
The drugs were administered by Jackson 's physician Dr Conrad Murray , and the verdict has been considered likely to increase the chances of criminal charges being brought against his doctors . 
According to the document , Jackson 's most serious health problem was his chronically inflamed lungs , but this was not serious enough to be a contributing factor to his death . 
The post mortem did not uncover any physical problems that may have limited Jackson 's ability to perform . 
`` His overall health was fine , '' said Dr Zeev Kain of the University of California , who reviewed the report for AP but was not involved in the post-mortem examination . 
`` The results are in normal limits , '' he added . 
The report also revealed that Jackson had a number of scars on his body , including behind his ears and beside each of his nostrils . 
Dr Kain concluded they were likely to have been caused by cosmetic surgery , while others , including on the knee , were likely to have been created by medical procedures . 
The document also states that the singer was bald at the front of his head and had what appeared to be a dark tattoo stretching across his head . 
His remaining hair was described as short and tightly-curled , it added . 
The coroner reported that Jackson had depigmentation of the skin around his face , chest , abdomen and arms . 
The full autopsy report has yet to be officially released to the public , but the conclusion that Jackson 's death was homicide has been disclosed .

2010-02-05,"Dr Murray has denied he caused Michael Jackson 's death Los Angeles prosecutors will file a criminal case against Michael Jackson 's doctor on Monday in connection with the singer 's death , officials say . 
Dr Conrad Murray 's legal team says it expects him to be charged with involuntary manslaughter . 
The announcement came shortly before the doctor had planned to surrender himself at a Los Angeles courthouse . 
Details of charges will be officially released Monday , the LA district attorney 's office said . 
Involuntary manslaughter occurs when a death is the indirect result of negligence or recklessness . 
Jackson died at his Los Angeles home on 25 June aged 50 . 
His death was ruled as homicide , mainly caused by the powerful anesthetic Propofol . 
Several drugs were found in Michael Jackson 's body A cocktail of drugs - including sedatives Midazolam and Diazepam , the painkiller Lidocaine and the stimulant Ephedrine - were also detected in his body a coroner confirmed . 
Dr Murray told police he had been giving Jackson Propofol as part of his treatment for insomnia , according to an affidavit made public in August . 
But he has always maintained he did not prescribe nor administer anything that should have killed the singer . 
The legal wrangling comes after several days of negotiations where his lawyers have tried to arrange for Dr Murray to surrender to prosecutors , in an attempt to avoid him being handcuffed and arrested . 
`` It seems ridiculous to us that it 's been dragging on this long '' , Dr Murray 's defense team spokeswoman Miranda Sevcik was quoted as saying by AP . 
`` To us this is showmanship and we are just done '' , she added . 
"
2010-02-09,"The judge told Dr Murray he must not administer anesthetic Michael Jackson 's former doctor has denied a charge of involuntary manslaughter over the singer 's death , at a court in Los Angeles . 
Dr Conrad Murray was bailed for $ 75,000 -LRB- # 48,000 -RRB- after pleading not guilty to `` unlawfully , and without malice , killing Michael Joseph Jackson '' . 
A judge must decide whether to proceed to trial . 
A conviction could bring a jail term of up to four years . 
Jackson died at his home on 25 June last year at the age of 50 . 
His death was ruled as homicide , mainly caused by the anesthetic Propofol . 
A cocktail of drugs - including sedatives midazolam and diazepam , the painkiller lidocaine and the stimulant ephedrine - were also detected in his body , a coroner confirmed . 
Members of the Jackson family arrive at court for Dr Murray 's hearing Prosecutors had filed one count of involuntary manslaughter . 
Dr Murray stood straight and spoke softly as he addressed the judge . 
After entering his plea , Dr Murray surrendered his passport . 
He was then taken to have his fingerprints and a mugshot processed . 
He is allowed to continue to practice medicine , but can not use certain drugs . 
Judge Keith Schwartz told Dr Murray : `` You may not under any circumstances use any anesthetic agents , specifically Propofol . 
`` You are not to be using that , you 're not to prescribe that , you 're not to have it in any manner whatsoever ... and you are not to give any other heavy sedative medications like that . '' 
The bail of $ 75,000 was three times the standard figure for involuntary manslaughter , but a quarter of the sum prosecutors had been seeking . 
The next hearing has been set for 5 April . 
Members of Michael Jackson 's family - father Joe , mother Katherine , brothers Jermaine , Tito , Jackie and Randy and sister LaToya - were in court for the hearing . 
When asked by a reporter as he arrived what he thought about Dr Murray being charged with involuntary manslaughter , Jermaine said simply : `` It 's not enough '' . 
Joe Jackson said only `` looking for justice '' . 
A lawyer for the family , Brian Oxman , speaking to CBS television , said of the involuntary manslaughter charge : `` I do n't think it would satisfy anybody , the millions of fans around the world . '' 
A number of the singer 's fans had shouted `` justice for Michael '' as Dr Murray arrived at court . 
Mark Lester , who is godfather to one of Michael Jackson 's children , told the BBC 's Newshour someone should be punished . 
`` At the end of the day it 's not going to bring Michael back . 
There has to be some punishment meted out if only to prevent a further occurrence of this happening . 
`` It 's just the most horrible , horrible scenario . 
There are no winners here . '' 
Dr Murray had been hired to be Jackson 's personal physician last spring as the singer prepared for his comeback concerts in London . 
We 'll make bail , we 'll plead not guilty and we 'll fight like hell But he has always maintained he neither prescribed nor administered anything that should have killed the singer . 
After a week of speculation over the manslaughter charge , Dr Murray had been expected to surrender to authorities last Friday . 
But a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorney said the office had decided to delay action until Monday . 
The statement came after several days of negotiations , where Dr Murray 's lawyers tried to arrange for him to surrender to prosecutors in an attempt to avoid him being handcuffed and arrested . 
Dr Murray was not handcuffed as he arrived in court . 
Speaking before the charges were filed , the physician 's defense lawyer , Ed Chernoff , said the doctor was prepared for the legal battle ahead . 
`` We 'll make bail , we 'll plead not guilty and we 'll fight like hell , '' he said . 
The charge follows months of careful investigation , with prosecutors said to be keen to avoid an unsuccessful high-profile prosecution like that of former football star OJ Simpson . 
Originally from Grenada , Dr Murray moved to the US and trained as a doctor . 
In 2000 , he opened his own practice in Las Vegas , expanding with a second clinic in Houston in 2006 . 
However , he encountered financial difficulties and reports suggest he filed for bankruptcy in 2002 while living in California . 
Jackson hired the physician on a salary of more than $ 150,000 -LRB- # 96,000 -RRB- a month in May 2009 .

Dr Conrad Murray was bailed for $ 75,000 -LRB- # 48,000 -RRB- after pleading not guilty to `` unlawfully '' killing the star , at a court in Los Angeles earlier this week . 
If convicted he may face four years in jail . 
He is due back in court in April . 
Dr Murray 's lawyer , Edward Chernoff , has stressed the 56-year-old intends `` to keep practising medicine '' . 
Miranda Sevcik , a spokeswoman for Dr Murray and Mr Chernoff , said the doctor was making arrangements to work out of another physician 's office in Las Vegas , having closed his own premises in the city last August . 
`` We 're not sharing the location because the doctor 's primary concern is for his patients ' privacy , '' said Sevcik . 
We 'll make bail , we 'll plead not guilty and we 'll fight like hell Lawyer Ed Chernoff , speaking in Los Angeles earlier this week Under the terms of his bail , Dr Murray is allowed to continue to practice medicine , but can not use certain drugs . 
Judge Keith Schwartz told Dr Murray on Monday : `` You may not under any circumstances use any anesthetic agents , specifically Propofol . 
Dr Murray , a cardiologist , continues to operate his other practice in Houston , having resumed work there in November . 
He is licensed to practice medicine in Nevada , Texas and California , although the California Medical Board is preparing to seek removal of his licence there .

Man who drinks daughter 's breast milk to combat cancer Cancer sufferer Tim Browne pours a rather bizarre ingredient over his breakfast cornflakes his daughter s breast milk . 
Mum-of-one Georgia , 27 , expresses her milk after feeding baby son Monty , then delivers it to her ailing dad in the hope that it will boost his immune system as he battles colon and liver cancer . 
And one month after drinking her milk mixed with his daily pinta , scans showed that 67-year-old Tim s cancer had reduced . 
Tim , a retired teacher , of Calne , Wilts , said : It s not unpleasant just slightly pungent and oily . 
But once it is mixed with cow s milk , I can t taste it . 
I do feel like I have a special bond with Georgia and Monty . 
Daughter Georgia , of Bristol , said : I don t find it strange at all . 
I m just glad to help . 
My mum Carole and my siblings are right behind it . 
In fact , they all think it s quite funny and Dad s told his friends . 
Tim was diagnosed with cancer in July 2007 , a week before Georgia s wedding . 
He had an operation to remove a tumor and a year of chemotherapy put the disease in remission . 
But it returned when Georgia was pregnant . 
Baby Monty was just a month old when she saw a TV documentary on the benefits of breast milk . 
She said : This man with prostate cancer swore that drinking breast milk every day had reduced his tumors . 
Dad agreed it was a worth a go . 
Tim s doctors support the odd concoction . 
But although scans show that his condition has improved , it can not be proved if it is down to the milk or chemotherapy . 
World Cancer Research Fund UK said : We are not aware of any evidence that breast milk brings any benefits to cancer patients . 
Georgia said : I d do anything to give my dad more time . 
Prince Philip in strip club gaffe Prince Philip put his foot in it during a visit to a barracks when he asked a young Navy sea cadet instructor if she worked in a strip club . 
The Duke of Edinburgh 's question provoked howls of laughter from Elizabeth Rendle , 24 , and her friends , reports the Daily Mail . 
Miss Rendle , a barmaid , said Philip had asked her what she did for a living : `` I told him I worked in a club . 
He then asked if it was a strip club , '' she said . 
The 88-year-old royal then appeared to think better of the suggestion in the current weather and joked that such an occupation would be `` too cold '' . 
The Duke was with the Queen at Wyvern Barracks in Exeter during a tour of Devon . 
Miss Rendle later said that , far from being offended by the question , she felt Prince Philip had been `` putting people at their ease '' . 
She said : `` He was just going round chatting with people , asking them what they did for a living . 
`` It was a joke and we were all laughing which drew everyone else 's attention . 
I do n't think he put his foot in it . 
It was a joke and I did n't take any offence . '' 
Row over Tiger Woods blow-up doll Lawyers for Tiger Woods are reportedly trying to halt the sale of a series of sex toys which exploit the golfer 's personal problems . 
-LRB- Unsuitable\/Broken URL removed by Moderator -RRB- The toys include a ` Take Home , Blow-up Tiger Love Doll ' and are for sale on the website of Pipedream Products . 
Pipedream is advertising its Tiger products as being `` available for a very limited time only '' . 
The US gossip website TMZ.com has managed to obtain a copy of a lawyer 's letter to Pipedream . 
It is demanding that the company stops selling the products , recalls all items that have already been distributed and destroys all stock . 
This is n't the first time lawyers have been called to deal with offensive products in the wake of the Tiger Woods scandal . 
In February , Joslyn James , one of his extramarital girlfriends , called on her lawyers to stop the sale of sets of `` mistress '' golf balls in which each ball featured the face of one of his alleged lovers . 
Michael Jackson 's syringe ` up for sale ' The syringe that allegedly administered Michael Jackson 's fatal dose of drugs is reportedly set to go on sale for # 3.3 million . 
The needle is believed to have been obtained secretly and is apparently being offered around Las Vegas auction houses , reports the Daily Mirror . 
Michael Jackson 's family are said to have been informed by lawyers representing the unnamed seller and are said to be desperate to stop the sale . 
The artefact could go under the hammer on June 25 - the first anniversary of the singer 's death in Los Angeles . 
His personal doctor , Conrad Murray , 57 , has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after allegedly administering drugs such as Valium , lorazepam and propofol to the troubled star . 
An autopsy found that Jackson died from `` lethal levels '' of propofol , a powerful anesthetic . 
The syringe set to go on sale is said to be the one used to administer the fatal dose . 
The Mirror quoted a source as saying : `` This is one of the sickest lots ever put up . 
The syringe is no longer needed in the inquest or in Murray 's forthcoming trial but the moral implications do n't bear thinking about . 
`` The guy who has possession of the needle has been in meetings with his legal team , making sure it is legitimate and his to sell . 
`` The plan is to flog it for up to $ 5m in a big Vegas casino but he 's been told he may have to sell it somewhere that does n't have ` reciprocal legal agreements with the United States ' , such as Brazil or even Libya . 
`` Rumours are leaking thick and fast and the Jackson family are aware of the auction plan . 
They are furious and incensed that someone is yet again trying to profit from him . 
It 's an incredibly distressing time for them . '' 
Theme park takes the p \*\*\* A Surrey theme park is calling on members of the public to submit their urine samples in a bid to find the country 's most pungent smelling wee . 
Thorpe Park , near Chertsey , wants it to become the signature stench of its brand new attraction , SAW Alive - billed as the world 's most extreme live action horror maze . 
Bosses are offering a # 500 cash prize to the person who submits the winning sample and is asking entrants to attend the park on Friday , 26 , February between 11am and 2pm . 
The distinctive smell of the winning entry will be recreated and feature in the new attraction , which features six traps depicting the most grisly and iconic scenes from the six SAW films . 
It will be pumped into the iconic washroom scene , recreating a `` realistic and truly gut wrenching sensory experience '' designed to test the nerve of all who enter . 
Laura Sinclair , Thorpe Park 's entertainments manager , will be responsible for selecting the most stomach turning urine sample . 
She said : `` We want SAW Alive to be as authentic and terrifying as possible to make visitors feel as if they are living in a real life horror film . 
`` To do this we need to really push the boundaries of what our guests experience from a sensory point of view with the use of smells , special lighting and effects such as electrocution and vibrating floors that will create a full on attack of the senses . 
`` We 've begun creating some of the stenches of SAW Alive but need the help of the public to create the most realistic and unsavoury urine odour . 
We are looking for a sample that will really get the public gagging . ''

2010-06-09,"Jackson 's brothers were among the mourners at the public funeral service Michael Jackson fans will have limited access to the cemetery where the singer is interred on the first anniversary of his death , US authorities have said . 
Fans will be able to pay their respects in the grounds of California 's Forest Lawn cemetery , but not at the mausoleum where the pop star was laid to rest . 
`` They will be viewing it from a distance , '' police officer Tom Lorenz told the Los Angeles Times . 
Jackson died of a cardiac arrest at his home on 25 June last year . 
His death was ruled as homicide , largely as a result of the powerful anesthetic drug Propofol . 
Jackson 's doctor , Conrad Murray has denied a charge of involuntary manslaughter over the singer 's death . 
Sgt Lorenz said : `` We understand that Forest Lawn is working with the Jackson family for some kind of commemoration . 
`` We will be working closely with Forest Lawn to ensure the safety of those who want to pay their respects to Michael Jackson while ensuring the safety of others who are coming to the cemetery to pay respects to their loved ones , '' he added . 
Plans are expected to be finalized by the end of this week . 
The city of Los Angeles has no plans to issue special permits for access to the cemetery which would allow streets to be closed off and the sale of memorabilia . 
The singer was buried at a ceremony in September which was seen on television , while fans were largely kept away from the cemetery grounds . 
Jackson is due to be posthumously inducted into the Apollo Legends Hall of Fame at a ceremony in New York on 14 June . 
The singer , along with his brothers , won a talent show at the New York theater in 1967 , which led to the Jackson Five being signed to Motown Records .

2010-06-14,"Michael Jackson 's family were in court for the decision The doctor accused of giving Michael Jackson a lethal dose of anesthetic will be allowed to work in California as he awaits trial , a court has ruled . 
During a brief procedural hearing , a Los Angeles judge said he did not have the authority to ban Dr Conrad Murray . 
Members of the popstar 's family were inside court to hear the ruling . 
Dr Murray , 57 , denies involuntary manslaughter of Jackson , who died last June . 
A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for 23 August . 
California 's attorney general had asked the judge to suspend the cardiologist in the run-up to the trial . 
But Dr Murray 's lawyers argued that he needed to continue working to pay for his defense . 
Dr Conrad Murray faces up to four years in jail if convicted They said he had no intention of practising in California , but argued that a ban in that state would affect his working in Texas and Nevada . 
Judge Michael Pastor said the matter had already been ruled on by a previous judge , and he refused to allow the attorney general 's application . 
`` I do not have the ability to revisit a ruling by one of my colleagues , '' he said . 
The doctor is alleged to have administered a lethal dose of Propofol and other drugs , which resulted in the popstar 's death on 25 June . 
A condition of Dr Murray 's bail is that he does not administer Propofol . 
If convicted , he faces up to four years in jail .

2010-06-24,"Michael Jackson was ` murdered for money ' , says sister Page last updated at 08:58 GMT , Thursday , 24 June 2010 09:58 UK Michael Jackson was murdered for money , according to his sister LaToya LaToya Jackson has claimed her brother Michael was murdered because he was `` worth so much more dead than alive '' . 
Speaking during a TV interview , the singer demanded what she called `` the truth '' surrounding the star 's death in June 2009 . 
She said : `` He was murdered for his catalogue and they knew that . '' 
Tomorrow -LRB- 25 June -RRB- marks the one year anniversary of the Thriller singer 's death with fans organising tributes around the globe . 
Earlier this week music trade magazine Billboard reported that the royalties accumulated since the star 's death had earned the Jackson estate $ 1 billion -LRB- # 677 million -RRB- . 
In an interview with GMTV she said : `` Personally I think it is a slap in the face , not just to Michael but to the entire family . 
It 's totally unfair , it 's wrong and it was not an accident . '' 
Asked whether she believed the star was murdered , she added : `` I never had a doubt . 
LaToya Jackson claims her brother 's death was `` not an accident '' `` You must remember from the day that I found out that Michael was no longer with us , when my mother screamed ` he 's dead ' on the phone , I just went into this , ` Who did it ? '' ' 
Michael Jackson 's personal physician Dr. Conrad Murray has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter and is currently awaiting trial . 
LaToya 's not the only member of the Jackson family talking ahead of the first anniversary of Michael 's death . 
His brother Jermaine 's claiming converting to Islam might have saved his life . 
`` I felt that if Michael would have embraced Islam he would still be here today , '' the former Jackson 5 member told the BBC World Service . 
Jermaine said life had been `` tough '' on his family since his brother 's passing . 
`` We 'll never get over it , '' he said . 
Jermaine Jackson says the past year 's been tough on the whole family `` There are n't no words to describe the feeling , we are just learning to live with it . '' 
Jermaine went on to question why Michael is getting so much positive attention now , when before his death many saw him as a bit of a joke . 
`` The love that they are giving my brother now he is dead is the love they should have shown him when he was alive . '' 
Meanwhile , the Los Angeles Forest Lawn cemetery have confirmed fans will be allowed to leave flowers on an outdoor terrace near the singer 's burial site to mark the anniversary but that balloons , candles and doves will not be permitted . 
Reverend Al Sharpton , who presided over Jackson 's memorial service last year said : `` I do n't think the world has been able to mourn him properly because there 's too many unanswered questions . 
Speaking in New York regarding the anniversary , he added : `` I do n't think we can heal until we look at the wounds . 
Who inflicted the wound and why . 
`` I think we can celebrate his life , but we ca n't be settled with his death until we know , who , what , when and why . 
And we still do n't know . ''

2010-06-24,"24 June 2010 Last updated at 14:59 GMT Help A year on from the death of Michael Jackson , the singer 's fans are as passionate about their idol as ever . 
Many have traveled from around the world to be in Los Angeles , US , to mark the anniversary . 
These fans spoke to the BBC outside the LA courthouse where Dr Conrad Murray recently appeared on a charge of involuntary manslaughter . 
"
2010-06-25,"By Peter Bowes BBC News , Los Angeles Jackson was due to play 50 UK dates Michael Jackson died from an overdose of sedatives on 25 June , 2009 at the age of 50 . 
The death of the music superstar prompted an outpouring of grief from fans around the world and resulted in the singer 's doctor , Conrad Murray , being charged with involuntary manslaughter . 
We take a look at some of the unresolved issues surrounding the late King of Pop . 
In the months before his death , Michael Jackson employed Dr Conrad Murray , a cardiologist with practices in Las Vegas and Houston , as his personal physician . 
He was with the singer on the day he died but the doctor has always maintained that nothing he did should have killed Jackson . 
Dr Murray denies any wrongdoing On 8 February , 2010 , Dr Murray appeared in court in Los Angeles and pleaded not guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter . 
He has since made two further court appearances in the case and remains on $ 75,000 -LRB- # 50,000 -RRB- bail . 
He is free to practice medicine , providing he does not administer powerful sedatives , such as Propofol . 
Dr Murray is due to appear in court again on 23 August , when Judge Michael Pastor is expected to set a date for a preliminary hearing , which should start within 60 days of that date . 
A trial date can not be set until the process is completed and Judge Pastor has had an opportunity to consider the evidence . 
Dr Murray could be sent to jail for up to four years if found guilty . 
Like Elvis Presley , Michael Jackson remains a hugely powerful commodity from beyond the grave . 
Jackson is estimated to have made more than $ 1bn since his death According to estimates by music newspaper Billboard , the singer 's estate made more than $ 1bn -LRB- # 668m -RRB- since his death . 
The publication says album sales have generated about $ 383m -LRB- # 259m -RRB- and revenue from the film , This Is It , amounted to nearly $ 400m -LRB- # 267m -RRB- . 
Jackson 's This is It concerts , despite never taking place , also proved to be hugely profitable . 
Many fans held on to their tickets as souvenirs , instead of refunding them , which brought in about $ 6.5 m -LRB- # 4.3 m -RRB- , to be shared with the promoter AEG . 
The estate also made money from DVD sales , downloads , royalties and ringtones . 
It was revealed last week that the estate has agreed to foot the bill for Jackson 's memorial service in Los Angeles , with $ 1.3 m -LRB- # 868,169 -RRB- to be paid to the City of Los Angeles and the LA Police Foundation . 
In death , Jackson achieved the musical comeback that he had yearned for in the latter years of his life . 
He was the biggest selling album artist of 2009 , with 8.3 million sales , the vast majority of which were posthumous . 
In the past year , nearly 9 million of his albums have sold in the US alone , according to chart analyists Nielsen SoundScan . 
This is It , the film that documented the singer 's rehearsals for his London concerts , is the highest-grossing concert film and documentary in cinematic history . 
Sony Music Entertainment will release 10 albums of Jackson 's music over the next seven years , including one of previously unreleased material . 
Jackson 's children spoke at a Grammy awards tribute to the late singer Jackson 's children , Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. -LRB- 13 -RRB- , Paris Katherine Jackson -LRB- 12 -RRB- and Prince Michael Jackson II -LRB- 8 -RRB- , commonly known as Blanket , are being cared for by their grandmother , Katherine , who was awarded guardianship in accordance with Jackson 's wishes . 
The children have largely stayed out of the public eye , with the exception of Jackson 's memorial service and the Grammy Awards ceremony . 
The children have been schooled at home although it has been reported that Michael Joseph -LRB- Prince -RRB- will attend a private school from September . 
Jackson 's fans are an ever-present force at court hearings for Dr Conrad Murray . 
They claim the charge of involuntary manslaughter is too lenient and have criticised prosecutors on the case . 
Fans reflect on the Jackson annniversary Many fans have vowed to continue fighting for `` justice '' for their idol . 
`` I love him even more than I did already , '' said Natalia Franco , at a recent hearing . 
`` It 's just now that we 're really grasping his message of love and humanitarianism , '' added Amy Kimes . 
`` On the one-year anniversary I 'm very anxious ... I 'm asking lots of questions of why . ''

2010-06-25,"Fans around the world marked one year since the singer 's death Pop star Michael Jackson 's father has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the doctor charged with giving him a lethal overdose one year ago . 
The civil suit from Joe Jackson accuses Dr Conrad Murray of professional negligence in administering a fatal mix of sedatives to the singer . 
The suit was filed as fans around the world marked the first anniversary of Jackson 's death at the age of 50 . 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in his death . 
Mr Jackson 's complaint seeks damages of more than $ 75,000 -LRB- # 50,000 -RRB- and alleges that Dr Murray was negligent in administering his son with the anesthetic propofol and other drugs . 
It also accuses him of secrecy and poor training and claims that Dr Murray 's clinics in Las Vegas , Nevada , and Houston , Texas , did not adequately supervise him . 
Fans sing outside the Jackson family home A spokeswoman for the doctor said she would not comment until his lawyers had reviewed the lawsuit . 
The case will run parallel with the criminal trial against Dr Murray , which is expected to begin next year . 
Dr Murray was treating Jackson as he prepared for a series of concerts in London . 
As the suit was filed in a federal court in Los Angeles , fans of the singer around the world paid him tribute . 
In New York , the Apollo Theatre - where Jackson and his brothers won a talent contest and were subsequently signed to Motown Records - fans recreated his famous dance moves and a letter from his mother Katherine was read out . 
In Los Angeles , celebrities including Mickey Rooney and Corey Feldman attended a tribute to the singer , Forever Michael , at the Beverly Hills Hilton hotel . 
The show included a performance by Michael 's brother , Tito . 
Proceeds from the event went to the Jackson Family Foundation . 
In his hometown of Gary , Indiana , Jackson 's mother attended a memorial service outside the performer 's childhood home and unveiled a monument to him . 
Other family members visited the Los Angeles cemetery where the musician is at rest and greeted some of the fans who had gathered outside . 
Flowers were also left in tribute to the late star in Tokyo , where 50 fans spent the night in an exhibition of his possessions . 
Meanwhile , prisoners in the Philippines were to mark the anniversary by staging a version of Thriller for invited members of the public on Saturday . 
The inmates of Cebu jail became an internet phenomenon when they were filmed performing the dance in 2007 . 
Jackson has been named as the biggest selling artist in the UK since his death last year , with 4.3 million sales . 
That exceeds his chart performance during his 1980s heyday , the Official Chart Company has said .

2010-06-26,"By Peter Bowes BBC News , Los Angeles Fans sing outside the Jackson family home It was a day for Michael Jackson 's fans to remember their idol . 
A year on from his sudden death , tributes were paid to the pop star outside the family home , the cemetery where he was laid to rest and at his star on Hollywood 's Walk of Fame . 
The fans brought flowers , held candlelight vigils and left handwritten notes paying homage to the musician . 
`` I 'm sad and I miss him but it does n't feel like a year since he 's been gone , '' said Vanessa Montez , who visited the Jackson family home in Encino , California . 
`` He 's very much still alive through his music and in my heart . '' 
Kellie Sargent said : `` He was the best entertainer there ever was on the planet so that 's why we 're here all the way from Atlanta , Georgia . 
`` It 's sad in a way but it 's a celebration of his life and entertainment . '' 
Fans traveled to Los Angeles from around the world . 
`` I 'm here for Michael Jackson because I love him , '' said Valerie Giordani from the south of France . 
`` It cost me a lot of money , a lot of time , but I do n't mind because my husband and I really love him . '' 
The main focus of the Los Angeles tributes was at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park , where the singer 's golden casket was entombed last September in a neo-classical mausoleum . 
`` I always wanted a chance to show him my gratitude but now I know I never will because he 's not with us anymore , '' said Sekou Barrow , another fan . 
`` He has n't been with us for the last year , and today we 're here at the memorial park to celebrate his life . '' 
`` It 's refreshing to see that everyone is celebrating the life of Michael Jackson , not mourning the death , '' added Carlo Riley . 
`` We had him for 50 years , more than we could ever ask for . 
He produced a large amount of material for generations to enjoy so I 'm very pleased to have been alive during his lifetime . '' 
Outside Jackson 's rented home in Beverly Hills , sightseeing buses crawled along the street , at the precise minute , 12-months on , that the singer was rushed to hospital . 
A wax model of Jackson was put on display in front of Madame Tussauds on Hollywood Boulevard , close to the singer 's star on the Walk of Fame . 
The star itself was covered in floral tributes and surrounded by candles . 
Some fans left notes for Jackson . 
Tour buses drove past the house where Michael Jackson died `` We miss you Michael , '' read one . 
`` You were our angel on earth , now you an angel in Heaven , '' said another . 
Dennis Ezequeiel , dressed as Jackson , visited the star with his mother . 
`` He 's the best because he helped the people so much and that 's why I like to dress like him , '' said the 10-year old . 
`` I like the dances he did and the songs like Man in the Mirror . '' 
Some of the fans reflected on the slow pace of the legal proceeding surrounding Dr Conrad Murray , Jackson 's physician , who has pleaded not guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter . 
If the case goes to trial , it is likely to be well into next year before a jury hears the evidence . 
`` I wish there were closure , '' said Kimberly Solano from Washington , New Jersey . 
`` But I understand that things take time and I just pray that the family finds peace . '' 
The tributes will continue throughout the weekend . 
Jackson family members are expected to attend a gala event , `` Forever Michael , '' at a Beverly Hills hotel on Saturday .

2010-07-29,"Jackson died in June 2009 at the age of 50 However , one has been referred to California 's state medical board for prescribing drugs under an alias . 
Jackson 's personal doctor Conrad Murray , who denies involuntary manslaughter , was not one of those questioned by state investigators . 
He is accused of giving Jackson a lethal overdose of anesthetic . 
Los Angeles police had asked Californian state investigators to look into the way the doctors had prescribed drugs . 
They searched a drug database , which monitors the prescription of controlled substances , as part of their investigation . 
Lawyer Brian Oxman , who is representing Jackson 's father in a wrongful death civil case , said he was `` very disappointed '' . 
`` The misuse of medications by Michael Jackson in the last years of his life was excessive and to fail to bring that to the public eye is ignoring reality , '' he said . 
In his civil case , Joe Jackson accuses Dr Murray of professional negligence in administering a fatal mix of sedatives to the singer . 
The Drug Enforcement Agency has also stopped investigating any other doctors who treated Jackson , a spokeswoman said .

2010-09-16,"Michael Jackson 's mother sues concert promoter Jackson was preparing for a series of concerts at the time of his death Katherine Jackson contends it failed to provide life-saving equipment and oversee a doctor who was hired to look out for the pop star 's well-being . 
Her legal action claims the singer was put under great pressure to complete the London concerts for which he was rehearsing at the time of his death . 
AEG has yet to comment on the action . 
Ms Jackson 's civil action , which seeks unspecified damages , was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday . 
Kenny Ortega , director of the planned This is It series of concerts , was also named as a defendant . 
Katherine Jackson contends that AEG and its agents told her son it would provide the equipment and hire Dr Conrad Murray to care for him so he could perform at the concerts in London . 
Her action alleges its representations were false `` because in reality AEG was merely doing whatever it took to make sure that Michael Jackson could make it to rehearsals and shows '' . 
`` At the time of his death , Michael Jackson was under the immediate care of a doctor selected by , hired by , and controlled by AEG , '' the complaint continues . 
It claims the company `` demanded and required '' the singer be treated by Dr Murray , who is alleged to have administered a lethal dose of Propofol and other drugs which resulted in the pop star 's death on 25 June 2009 . 
Michael Jackson 's parents have both filed wrongful death lawsuits Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter and is expected to stand trial next year . 
Katherine Jackson is the guardian of the singer 's three children and is suing AEG on their behalf . 
Her action claims Jackson 's eldest son , Prince , suffered great trauma and severe emotional distress because he witnessed his father 's final moments . 
`` The purpose of this lawsuit is to prove to the world the truth about what happened to Michael Jackson , once and for all , '' Katherine Jackson 's lawyer said in a statement . 
Earlier this year Jackson 's father , Joe , filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Dr Murray , accusing him of professional negligence . 
Mr Murray 's attorneys filed a motion on Wednesday seeking a dismissal of that action , which did not name AEG .

I used to do it with my dad . ''

John Branca and John McClain said the show was `` in shockingly bad taste '' .

They also say Dr Murray improperly concealed his use of propofol , a surgical anesthetic typically used in a clinical setting . 
On Wednesday , bodyguard Alberto Alvarez testified that Dr Murray had summoned him to the singer 's bedroom , telling him something had gone wrong and ordering him to clean up medicine vials and intravenous bags , then afterward to call paramedics . 
Mr Alvarez said Jackson lay on the bed , his eyes and mouth open , connected to an IV tube and a urinary catheter .

2011-01-11,"Michael Jackson ` threatened to cancel concerts ' Dr Murray was bailed after pleading not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in February 2010 Michael Jackson told his doctor on the day he died he would have to cancel his comeback concerts unless he had a dose of propofol , a court has heard . 
Dr Conrad Murray told police he gave Jackson the anesthetic after a night administering lesser drugs to help him sleep , detective Orlando Martinez said . 
Prosecutors at the preliminary hearing in Los Angeles have said the drugs combination was lethal and accuse Dr Murray of involuntary manslaughter . 
He has pleaded not guilty . 
Mr Martinez , who interviewed Dr Murray two days after Jackson 's death on 25 June 2009 , said the doctor told him the singer had stopped breathing shortly after 1100 . 
The detective said Dr Murray admitted giving Jackson propofol - the key drug responsible for his death - between 1040 and 1050 . 
Mr Martinez said Dr Murray told him Jackson fell asleep at about 1100 . 
The doctor said he then left the room for `` two minutes '' to go to the bathroom but , on returning shortly after 1100 , found the singer had stopped breathing . 
He started to try to resuscitate Jackson but told Mr Martinez he did not call 911 himself because `` he said he was caring for his patient and he did not want to neglect him '' . 
Prosecutors say that phone records show the doctor made a series of calls between 1100 and 1200 and that an ambulance was not called until 1221 . 
Michael Jackson 's family have been attending the hearing Dr Murray administered other drugs - lorazepam , midazolam and valium - to Jackson throughout the night before in an attempt to help the star sleep . 
Jackson repeatedly told the doctor he would cancel his This Is It concerts in London if he could not sleep and said he wanted his `` milk '' , which was how he referred to propofol . 
Mr Martinez also said Dr Murray told him he had given Jackson doses of propofol six nights a week for two months but was trying to wean him off the drug as he feared his patient was becoming addicted . 
Following the preliminary hearing , which could end later this week , a judge will decide if there is enough evidence for Dr Murray to stand trial for involuntary manslaughter . 
He could face up to four years in prison if tried and convicted .

2011-01-13,"World News for Schools :12 January Hi there , I 'm Leah from the BBC World News for Schools . 
It 's Wednesday January the 12th . 
One year on from the Haiti earthquake -- but a million people are still living in tents . 
And Michael Jackson 's doctor is officially accused over his death . 
But first -- there 's no let up in Australia as flood waters pour into one of its biggest cities , Brisbane . 
People are fleeing to evacuation centres and tens of thousands of houses are expected to be under water when flood levels peak this evening . 
BBC reporter Nick Bryant is there : CLIP : `` The situation is going to get worse . 
People are trying to sandbag their homes in the hope that they can try and block the waters . 
But that 's a pretty forlorn hope . 
I 've just been speaking to the local mayor here , he says that twenty thousand homes are either going to be totally or partially flooded . '' 
There 's also been severe flooding in Sri Lanka . 
Weeks of heavy rain have led to two-hundred thousand people losing their homes -- and the rain shows no sign of stopping . 
Transporting water in Port-au-Prince , the capital of Haiti Next - it 's a year since the devastating earthquake in Haiti which killed around two hundred and fifty thousand people . 
Twelve months on a million people are still homeless and living in makeshift camps . 
So far hardly any of the rubble from collapsed buildings has been cleared and poor hygiene in camps has led to diseases like cholera spreading , killing many more . 
Haiti still faces many problems - with much of the money promised by foreign countries not yet received on the ground . 
Our World News for Schools reporter spoke to Hannah Reichardt who works for the charity Save the Children and is in the capital city Port au Prince : CLIP : `` Save the Children is very concerned that all the money promised has n't yet made it to the people who need it on the ground in Haiti . 
What we know is that something like half to sixty per cent of the money promised by the governments has n't yet made it here . '' 
Before the earthquake hit , many people lived in very poor conditions - with only half of children going to school . 
Hannah says the kids are a priority : CLIP : `` Children in Haiti have undergone more suffering in the last year than most children in other countries will ever know in their lifetime . 
They 've lost close friends and family , they 've seen children like them suffer from cholera and very threatening illnesses . 
They 've had to undergo so much it will have a profound impact on their lives for ever . 
But we also know that children if they 're given the right support can be highly resilient and they can bounce back . 
But they need to be able to return to a normal childhood as quickly as possible . '' 
Next -- there 's to be a trial over the death of pop singer Michael Jackson eighteen months ago . 
A judge in Los Angeles has ordered his personal doctor to face charges of being accidentally involved in his death -- and not giving the singer proper care . 
Dr Conrad Murray says -- he 's not guilty . 
Finally an Italian man has astonished doctors by sneezing a bullet out through his nose after being shot in the head . 
Darco Sangermano was in hospital waiting for treatment when the bullet popped out of his right nostril . 
He 's expected to make a full recovery . 
And for today 's question : how fast does the average sneeze travel ? 
Yesterday we asked what two awards were joined to make the new FIFA world player award ? 
And the answer is : French Football magazine 's and the old FIFA player of the year awards . 
OK , that 's all from the World News for Schools team . 
We 're back tomorrow !

Katherine Jackson 's suit argues that AEG Live pushed the singer too far in `` gruelling rehearsals '' . 
Jacko was due to perform 50 comeback concerts at the O2 Arena in London . 
His mother also claims AEG were responsible for hiring the doctor who is accused of the singer 's manslaughter . 
AEG had argued the case should n't be heard as Jackson was responsible for his own health . 
Michael Jackson died in June 2009 after suffering a cardiac arrest Jackson 's mother filed the lawsuit in September 2010 on behalf of herself and the star 's three children , Prince Michael , Michael Junior and Paris-Michael Katherine . 
She claims AEG ignored signs of physical stress which the singer showed in the months before his death , and that he was cold and shivering during the summer rehearsals for the tour . 
`` AEG insisted that he attend every rehearsal in a gruelling schedule , threatening that if he missed even one more they would cancel the tour , '' Mrs Jackson said . 
But entertainment giants AEG said nobody could have predicted that Jackson was going to die , or what Dr Conrad Murray 's actions would have been . 
The company 's lawyers said the singer himself had hired Dr Murray , who goes on trial in March 2011 for involuntary manslaughter . 
`` Michael Jackson was not helpless or incompetent , '' they said . 
But the judge dismissed their claims , setting a new court date of 22 March 2011 . 
He said : `` The question is did Michael Jackson witness the negligence and did he understand what was going on ? '' 
Jackson died in June 2009 from an overdose of the powerful anesthetic propofol , along with other sedatives and painkillers . 
The first of his sold out This Is It dates had been scheduled for the following month . 
When he made a brief appearance in the UK to launch the tour , Jackson himself said the shows would serve as a `` final curtain '' .

2011-04-08,"Nearly 200 potential jurors completed the questionnaire for Dr Murray 's trial Potential jurors in the upcoming trial of Michael Jackson 's personal doctor have been asked about their attitudes to celebrity and whether they have ever bought any of the star 's music . 
The questions are part of the process to select a fair panel ahead of the trial of Dr Conrad Murray , the BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani in Los Angeles reports . 
`` Have you ever considered yourself a fan of Michael Jackson ? '' 
reads question 97 on a 30-page list that potential jurors have had to complete . 
Question 99 asks : `` Did you ever watch ` This Is It ' -LRB- the documentary of Michael Jackson 's concert tour prep -RRB- ? '' 
The next one seeks to examine the contents of a juror 's music collection and - with poetic irony , for those familiar with George Orwell 's 1984 - Question 101 goes right to the heart of the matter : `` Have you already formed an opinion about the guilt or innocence of Conrad Murray ? '' 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter . 
It is alleged he illegally gave Jackson an overdose of the hospital drug propofol , which led to the singer 's death in June 2009 . 
Dr Murray 's lawyers have argued that Jackson 's poor health contributed to his death . 
The trial is due to start in early May , nearly two years after Jackson 's sudden demise . 
Dr Conrad Murray , who denies the charges , faces four years in prison if convicted In that time every twist and turn , every scrap of evidence or wisp of speculation , has been reported on , blogged about and retweeted . 
And the once-obscure specialist anesthetic propofol has become virtually a household name . 
The drug is included in a list of medications that potential jurors were asked about on the questionnaire . 
They were also asked to state if they knew any of a long list of people who may be called as witnesses or who may be referred to during the case . 
Thirteen members of the Jackson family are named , including the singer 's children - listed as Paris , Prince and Blanket . 
Question 88 asks for more than a simple yes or no. . 
Some of the questions focus on jurors ' attitudes to celebrities and the law Would-be panellists are required to state to what extent they agree with certain statements such as : `` Celebrities and high-profile people in Los Angeles get away with crimes because of their status . '' 
Later , they are quizzed about how closely they have followed the case and if they would be affected by the undoubtedly intense media scrutiny . 
Such is the high-profile nature that court officials called nearly 500 people to attend the preliminary jury selection process . 
Of those , nearly 200 completed the questionnaire , and may now be considered for the jury . 
Their answers will be scrutinised for any sign of bias , as the authorities work to ensure Dr Murray gets as fair a trial as possible .

Los Angeles Judge Michael Pastor sided with prosecutors who said the photos would show the star was healthy before he died in June 2009 of an overdose of a powerful surgical anesthetic . 
Dr Conrad Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter . 
He had been treating the singer for insomnia . 
In one image to be shown to the jury , the singer 's dead body is seen laid out on a coroner 's examination table in a hospital gown . 
In another he is naked but with parts of his body obscured . 
`` Although they are tragic , they are not gruesome or gory , '' said Deputy District Attorney David Walgren . 
Dr Murray 's defense lawyers had objected , saying the photographs would enflame jurors ' passions . 
In pre-trial testimony , jurors heard from an emergency medical worker who had attended the scene and said the singer looked like a hospice patient . 
Judge Pastor of the Los Angeles superior court also agreed to allow carefully redacted segments of Jackson 's concert film This Is It , filmed just before his death , which prosecutors say illustrate his mental and physical wellbeing . 
Prosecutors say Dr Murray gave him a lethal dose of propofol - a powerful anesthetic typically used in a clinical setting - and then failed to provide proper care .

In Los Angeles , lawyers for Dr Conrad Murray had asked for a delay to prepare for new prosecution witnesses . 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson 's June 2009 death at 50 . 
Prosecutors say he gave him a lethal dose of a powerful anesthetic and then failed to provide proper care . 
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor said he would dismiss the prospective jurors . 
Prosecutors have said Dr Murray , who had been treating the singer for insomnia , administered the lethal dose of propofol , a drug typically used in a clinical setting , then tried to cover it up .

2011-06-07,"The UK firm that insured Michael Jackson 's comeback gigs at London 's O2 arena has asked a judge in Los Angeles to nullify the $ 17.5 m -LRB- # 10.7 m -RRB- policy . 
Insurer Lloyd 's of London is suing promoter AEG Live saying it failed to supply details including apparent `` prescription drug use and\/or addiction '' . 
AEG took out the cancellation and non-appearance policy - with cover of up to $ 17.5 m - two months before Jackson 's June 2009 death , court papers suggest . 
AEG Live was not available for comment . 
Lloyd 's said a lawyer for AEG Live submitted a claim , along with Jackson 's death certificate , within days of the singer 's death . 
It said that , when AEG Live took out the policy - in which the singer was given the alias Mark Jones - it should have given full information about his medical history . 
The insurer said a required medical examination was never carried out . 
It also claimed it had sought information from the promoter about Jackson 's personal doctor , Conrad Murray , since December 2009 . 
AEG had failed to provide that information , Lloyd 's said . 
For all these reasons , Lloyd 's said it was not obliged to pay for the cost of canceling the shows - one of the biggest debts faced by the singer 's estate following his death . 
Dr Murray , who had been treating Jackson for insomnia , has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter over the singer 's death . 
Prosecutors say he gave Jackson a lethal dose of a powerful anesthetic and then failed to provide proper care .

2011-07-26,"The announcement of a Michael Jackson tribute concert in Cardiff in October . 
Two of Michael Jackson 's brothers have criticised a planned tribute concert to the pop superstar in Cardiff as `` inappropriate '' and `` ill-timed '' . 
Jermaine and Randy Jackson are unhappy that it will clash with the trial of Conrad Murray , the doctor charged in relation to their brother 's death . 
The 8 October gig at the Millennium Stadium was announced by producers Global Live Events on Monday . 
But the event has won the backing of the late singer 's mother Katherine . 
Jackson died in June 2009 aged 50 while rehearsing for his This Is It tour . 
When plans for the concert were announced it was reported that Mrs Jackson , and the singer 's sister La Toya and brothers Tito , Marlon and Jackie , were in support of it . 
At a press conference Mrs Jackson said : `` Michael gave his entire life to the world through his love , his music and his devotion to healing the planet . '' 
She said she was positive that the event would `` form a worthy celebration of Michael 's life . '' 
Jermaine and Randy Jackson said there would come a time and place for such a tribute She revealed that `` as many members of my family that are available '' would attend the event . 
However following the press conference the two brothers released a statement saying that while they supported `` the spirit '' of a tribute concert , in choosing the timing of it the promoter had `` disrespected '' their opinions and wishes . 
`` In light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter , Global Live , '' the statement said . 
No acts have been announced for the concert yet but a notice on the event 's website promises `` the world 's greatest performing artists '' will appear . 
STATEMENT BY JERMAINE AND RANDY JACKSON `` Today 's press conference in Los Angeles announced a tribute concert to Michael to be attended and supported by the Jackson family . 
`` However , we want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family . 
`` While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael 's death . 
`` As everyone knows , those proceedings commence September 20th , and this Michael Forever concert takes place in Cardiff , Wales , on 8 October . 
`` In light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter , Global Live . 
`` Furthermore , the decision to proceed with this concert disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms to Global Live during conversations in April when this event was presented to the majority of the family as an idea already in its advanced stages . 
`` There will come a time and place for an amazing and deserving tribute to Michael . 
But we feel that the most important tribute we can give to our brother at this time is to seek justice in his name . '' 
There are plans for the concert to be broadcast around the world to 30 countries in 2D and 3D . 
It will raise money for three charities including the Los Angeles-based Aids Project . 
Announcing the concert on Monday , Roger Lewis , group chief executive of the Welsh Rugby Union , which owns and operates the stadium , said the `` extra special '' concert would pay tribute to one of the world 's greatest pop icons of all time and benefit US and UK charities . 
He added it was `` fantastic news for music fans all over the world '' and that it would be `` a huge boost for Wales to host this spectacular one-off show . '' 
Global Live Events LLP has worked with a range of artists including Abba , The Beatles , Eric Clapton , Madonna , Placido Domingo , and Jackson himself . 
When the concert was revealed Chris Hunt , the firm 's president , said : `` We wanted to do something decent and worthy of Michael 's musical genius yet something fun and authentic that you would envision Michael attending with excitement and joy surrounded by talent that he respected and loved . '' 
Meanwhile , a Los Angeles judge has ruled that footage of Jackson rehearsing for a concert just days before his death will not be show in court . 
Prosecutors wanted to show several hours of unedited tapes filmed for the movie This Is It in an effort to prove Jackson was healthy before he died of a drug overdose in 2009 . 
The footage was not actually included in the movie , which was released four months after the singer 's death in 2009 . 
Sony Pictures , the studio behind the film , argued that showing the unseen footage in a public court may hurt its potential commercial value . 
Sony Pictures said it screened more than 100 hours of raw footage for the lawyers and the judge in the case . 
Judge Michael Pastor concluded on Monday that it would not help the defense and that `` it was a waste of my time . '' 
But the jury will be shown clips that were used in the film which show the star rehearsing for a series of comeback concerts in London .

It 's after opposition from Jermaine and Randy Jackson , who say the concert should n't go ahead because it will clash with Conrad Murray 's trial . 
Michael Jackson 's former doctor is accused of involuntary manslaughter . 
`` There 's nothing in this . 
It 's not something to get excited about , '' said Chris Hunt from Global Live Events . 
`` The notion that an event which reminds people just how fantastic Michael Jackson was , what a loss he was to the world he is , what a great singer , a great performer he was , should be inappropriate - it does n't compute , it does n't make sense . '' 
Jermaine and Randy Jackson also say Global Live has `` mishandled '' the booking as well as `` misjudging '' the event 's timing . 
Rock band Kiss were dropped from the bill after over comments made by Gene Simmons . 
During a magazine interview last year the bassist said Michael Jackson was a child abuser . 
Chris Hunt 's response to fans The singer was cleared of child molestation in 2005 . 
Chris Hunt says all the criticism about the concert is understandable but wrong . 
`` They were saying that it was a pity that there had not been a big scale , proper tribute to Michael . 
`` We began to think , ` Why do n't we try and do one . ' 
LaToya was the lead one but there were other family members around as well . 
`` There are two that are n't so happy . 
I do n't wish to be ungenerous to anyone . 
I have the greatest respect for Jermaine , who I 've met a number of times . 
`` He did a couple of times announce that he was going to organise a concert like this and then was n't unable to do so . 
So I suppose it 's a little understandable . '' 
A coalition of 35 fan communities has since written an open letter to the concert organisers asking for the event to be canceled . 
But Chris Hunt says they have n't heard all the facts . 
Michael Jackson was preparing for a series of UK gigs when he died in 2009 `` We have the greatest respect for the fans , '' he said . 
`` We 've been listening to the fans . 
`` I think what 's happened is that there 's been a campaign , which some of them have listened to and have n't heard our responses to it yet . 
`` This concert will sell out either very quickly or quickly . 
We have no worries about it at all . '' 
The Michael Forever concert takes place at Cardiff 's Millennium Stadium on 8 October . 
Artists confirmed to be taking part include Christina Aguilera , Leona Lewis , Cee Lo Green , JLS , Alexandra Burke and Beyonce , who will perform via satellite . 
Speaking to Newsbeat about the controversy surrounding the concert , Alexandra Burke said : `` I definitely think it should go ahead , but it 's not up to me . 
I think the family should decide amongst themselves . '' 
She added : `` I 've got three weeks of rehearsals booked in -LRB- for the concert -RRB- because I 'm trying to make sure I do these songs justice . ''

2011-08-30,"Michael Jackson judge bars skin doctor from testifying Jackson died shortly before his 50-date run of comeback concerts in London The judge said it was `` not relevant '' . 
The defense plan to portray Jackson as an addict who may have given himself a lethal dose of the drug propofol . 
Dr Murray , who was hired by Jackson to help prepare for his planned July 2009 comeback concerts at London 's O2 arena , was in charge of administering the anesthetic to the star . 
He has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter . 
In court in Los Angeles on Monday , Dr Murray 's lawyer Edward Chernoff said the defense 's position was that Jackson was addicted to demerol and was withdrawing from it when he died in June 2009 . 
But Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor ruled that Arnold Klein would not be called to testify after prosecution lawyers said the defense wanted to transfer responsibility for Jackson 's death to the dermatologist . 
Prosecution lawyer David Walgren also said Jackson 's autopsy found no traces of demerol . 
Dr Conrad Murray faces up to four years in prison if convicted The judge also barred the defense from calling five of Jackson 's other former doctors to give evidence . 
But he allowed them to call Allen Metzger - who had treated Jackson for two decades - and anaesthetist David Adams . 
Jackson had asked Mr Metzger for intravenous medicines to help him sleep two months before his death but the doctor had refused his request , defense lawyers say . 
And Mr Adams had given propofol to the singer on a number of occasions after dental work . 
A nurse who treated Jackson in 2009 will also be allowed to testify . 
Meanwhile , Judge Pastor has also ruled the defense can not call any witnesses to testify about Jackson 's 2005 trial and acquittal over child abuse charges , saying it would distract the jury . 
And he also refused a request to bring up a 2003 raid of the singer 's Neverland Ranch in California in which defense lawyers say propofol was found . 
Jury selection for the trial is due to begin on 8 September with opening arguments due to begin on 27 September .

2011-09-24,"Michael Jackson : Jury chosen for Dr Conrad Murray trial Jackson died shortly before his run of comeback concerts in London had been due to start A 12-member jury has been chosen for the trial of Michael Jackson 's personal doctor - more than two years after the pop star 's death . 
Seven men and five women were selected from a panel of nearly 400 people . 
This involved completing a 30-page questionnaire about Jackson and the media coverage of his death in June 2009 in Los Angeles . 
Dr Conrad Murray has pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter . 
The trial is due to start on Tuesday . 
Prosecutors say Dr Murray caused the pop star 's death by giving him a powerful anesthetic , propofol , to help him sleep . 
The jurors were selected on Friday after less than six hours of questioning by Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor and lawyers for the defense and prosecution . 
Half of the chosen panelists are Caucasian , five are Hispanic and one is African-American . 
The jurors have a wide range of professions , including a bus driver , paralegal and a bookseller . 
Dr Conrad Murray faces up to four years in prison if convicted The final selection came after weeks of close scrutiny of all the candidates . 
The questionnaire asked potential jurors to give their thoughts about the singer and the fact his family members would be in court for the evidence . 
They were asked whether they had seen the posthumous Jackson concert movie This Is It , or had bought any of his CDs , DVDs or memorabilia . 
The BBC 's Peter Bowes , in Los Angeles , says there is intense interest in the trial . 
Dr Murray 's lawyer Edward Chernoff has already said in court that the defense 's position is that Jackson was addicted to the painkiller demerol and was withdrawing from it when he died . 
Dr Murray , who was hired by Jackson to help prepare for his planned July 2009 comeback concerts at London 's O2 Arena , was in charge of administering the anesthetic to the star .

2011-09-27,"By Peter Bowes BBC News , Los Angeles The high profile trial in Los Angeles has attracted supporters of both Dr Conrad Murray and Michael Jackson More than two years after Michael Jackson 's sudden death , the singer 's personal physician has appeared in a Los Angeles court . 
Dr Conrad Murray , 58 , denies involuntary manslaughter . 
If convicted , the maximum sentence is four years in prison . 
It was a hot midsummer day in Los Angeles on 25 June , 2009 . 
Hollywood was mourning the loss of the actress Farrah Fawcett , as fans and celebrities paid tribute to the TV star , who had died from cancer , aged 62 . 
But that day will be remembered for another , altogether unexpected death and for the extraordinary outpouring of grief it provoked . 
Pop star Michael Jackson , a month shy of his 51st birthday , was rushed to hospital and pronounced dead , his brother Jermaine confirming the news to stunned fans in a hastily-arranged press conference . 
Jackson had recently stepped back into the limelight . 
He was rehearsing at the Staples Centre arena in Los Angeles for This Is It , his hugely anticipated concert series , which was due to start at the O2 in London on 13 July . 
The night before his death , he worked until after midnight . 
The next day , shortly after noon , he was discovered unconscious in his bedroom by his physician Dr Conrad Murray . 
Dr Conrad Murray faces up to four years in prison if convicted What happened in the time between those two events remains a mystery . 
At a preliminary hearing , several witnesses gave detailed accounts of the frenzied activity at Jackson 's home after the singer was found to be unresponsive . 
The singer 's death , according to the Los Angeles County Coroner , was a homicide caused by `` acute Propofol intoxication . '' 
Propofol is a sedative that is normally used in hospitals to induce or maintain anaesthesia during surgical procedures . 
It will be up to the jury to decide whether the actions of Dr Murray , during the frantic efforts to revive the singer and in the hours before , caused his death . 
`` We 're finally going to get a full airing of all the facts , '' says Steven Cron , a legal analyst . 
`` In order to be guilty of a crime one has to be grossly negligent , not just minimally negligent , and that 's what they 're trying to prove , '' says Mr Cron . 
Dr Murray has strongly defended himself against the charge of involuntary manslaughter . 
He has insisted that nothing he did should have killed Jackson . 
`` I think the forensic evidence is going to be really important , '' says Mr Cron . 
`` There were only two people in the room and one of them is no longer with us . 
The other is accused . '' 
The jury will hear testimony from dozens of witnesses , including some of those who were first on the scene , such as Jackson 's security guards and paramedics . 
Experts will also be called upon to answer questions about Propofol , which will be at the heart of the case . 
It has been suggested by Dr Murray 's lawyers that the publicity surrounding the case could rise to the levels seen during the murder trial of the former American footballer-turned movie actor OJ Simpson in 1995 . 
But the judge has refused a request to have the jury sequestered , or confined to a hotel , to shield them from outside influences , as they were during the Simpson trial . 
Jermaine Jackson said he is prepared for a media `` circus '' Instead , Judge Michael Pastor has advised them not to `` read , listen to or watch any news report or any other commentary about this case from any source '' and to `` keep an open mind throughout '' . 
`` I think the Conrad Murray trial will be the trial of the year -LRB- but -RRB- it will not be the trial of the century , '' says Linda Deutsch , a special correspondent with the Associated Press , and a veteran reporter at high profile cases in California . 
While the defendant , Dr Murray , is not a celebrity , the trial will receive global attention because the alleged victim is Jackson , the superstar who is still worshipped by fans around the world . 
The proceedings , like the Simpson trial , are being televised . 
Media outlets from around the world set up makeshift studios near the court building . 
Hundreds of Jackson fans lined the street . 
There will be a lottery every morning to allocate seats in the public gallery . 
`` The fact that it is Michael Jackson puts an entirely different profile on this case Michael Jackson was a fascinating man and he still fascinates even in death , '' says Ms Deutsch . 
The singer 's parents and famous siblings are all expected to make an appearance at LA 's Criminal Court building , taking it in turns to fill the eight seats the family has been allocated in the courtroom . 
Jackson 's three children will not attend the trial . 
`` We 're ready , '' says his brother Jermaine Jackson , `` We 're always ready for whatever . 
We 've been raised and taught to take it as it comes . '' 
`` I 'll be strong . 
Very , very strong - because I know when the system works for you and I know when it works against you , '' he adds . 
`` I know the truth and I 'm prepared for a circus . '' 
Judge Pastor has estimated that the trial , up to the point that the jury starts its deliberations , will last for five weeks .

Prosecutors claim Conrad Murray caused the pop star 's death by giving him a powerful anesthetic , propofol , to help him sleep .

2011-09-28,"Page last updated at 10:39 GMT , Wednesday , 28 September 2011 11:39 UK Propofol is a fast-acting hospital sedative used before anaesthetics The trial of Michael Jackson 's physician , Doctor Conrad Murray , has begun in Los Angeles with the jury being shown images of the singer lying dead in a hospital and rehearsing the day before his death . 
Dr Murray is accused of causing the 50-year-old 's death on 25 June 2009 . 
He denies charges of involuntary manslaughter . 
The prosecution team claims Conrad Murray is an incompetent physician who used an anesthetic called Propofol without the proper safeguards . 
The defense says Jackson caused his own death by taking a drug overdose , including Propofol , after Murray left his bedroom on the day of his death . 
Find out what drugs were found in Michael Jackson 's body . 
Propofol is a fast-acting hospital sedative , administered intravenously and used before anaesthetics . 
It was first used widely in the late 1980s . 
The drug , which Conrad Murray gave to the singer to help him sleep , is made by the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and is also sold under the brand name Diprivan . 
The prosecution team says Murray used large quantities of Propofol Experts say Propofol is extremely powerful and not meant for use outside hospitals and clinics . 
Propofol was referred to by Michael Jackson as his `` milk '' because of the milk-like appearance . 
The drug is administered either by intravenous drip or by being injected ahead of an anesthetic , or to keep a patient anesthetized during an operation . 
It is a preferred sedative in operating theaters because it is well tolerated and allows patients to recover quicker . 
It 's commonly used in outpatient surgery or as a sedative for certain examinations . 
Propofol is also used as a painkiller or anti-anxiety drug in post-operative care . 
Conrad Murray told police in 2009 that he gave Michael Jackson other drugs known as benzodiazepines , which are also used as sleep aids . 
But when they did not work , he claims Jackson demanded Propofol . 
Murray 's defense lawyer Ed Chernoff claimed the singer swallowed several pills of Lorazepam on the morning of his death , enough to put six people to sleep . 
It is widely used as a sedative and muscle relaxant . 
Also known as Ativan and Temesta , the drug is used short-term for insomnia , anxiety , seizures and for sedating aggressive patients . 
Midazolam is used in a similar way to Lorazepam . 
It is widely used as a sedative and to treat seizures . 
Also know as Dormicum , Hypnovel and Versed , the drug is also used short-term to treat severe insomnia and anxiety . 
Jackson was given four milligrams of the drug on the morning of his death . 
Diazepam is better known as Valium . 
It 's used as a relaxant for patients suffering from insomnia and anxiety as well as seizures . 
Michael Jackson was given a 10 milligram tablet of Diazepam at 1.30 am on the morning of his death because he could n't sleep . 
Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and is sometimes used to treat skin inflammations . 
It is used by dentists to anaesthetise patients ' gums . 
Michael Jackson had a dose of Propofol diluted with Lidocaine at 10.40 am on the day of his death . 
It is primarily used as an appetite suppressant and stimulant .

Dr Murray is charged with the involuntary manslaughter of Jackson . 
The clip , already aired in last week 's opening statements , was played in full on Wednesday at the trial in Los Angeles . 
Jackson 's slurred voice is heard telling Dr Murray of plans to build a children 's hospital - the biggest in the world - after the concerts , billed as This Is It . 
I love them because I did n't have a childhood , I feel their pain '' It would be an achievement , Jackson said , that even Elvis Presley and The Beatles did not match .

My performance will be up there helping my children and always be my dream , '' Jackson is heard telling his doctor in the 10 May 2009 recording .

2011-10-07,"Jurors in the trial of Michael Jackson 's doctor have for the first time heard audio of Dr Conrad Murray being questioned by police two days after the pop star 's death . 
In the recording , Dr Murray describes how he gave Jackson the anesthetic propofol after singer 's insomnia did not respond to other drugs . 
Dr Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter . 
Defense lawyers argue that Jackson gave himself the fatal dose of propofol . 
In the interview with police , Dr Murray says that on the night of 25 June 2009 , he injected Jackson with several sedatives , but the pop star remained wide awake . 
`` He 's not able to sleep naturally , '' he told detectives early in the interview . 
Jackson complained that he needed to sleep , as he had rehearsals for his comeback tour early the next morning . 
Dr Murray described giving Jackson lorazepam and another drug , Versed . 
`` And four o'clock came and four o'clock went and he was still awake , '' Dr Murray said in the recording , describing the 10-hour battle to get the star to fall asleep . 
Eventually , he said Jackson asked for his `` milk '' - which was his word for propofol . 
`` He said : ` Please , please give me some milk so I can sleep ' , '' Dr Murray told police . 
Jackson fell asleep after being given the injection . 
`` I watched him for a long enough period that I felt comfortable , '' Dr Murray said . 
He said that eventually he had to the leave the room for two minutes , and when he returned he found that Jackson had stopped breathing . 
He said he immediately tried to revive the singer by compressing his chest , and then called Jackson 's personal assistant to get help in the frantic resuscitation attempt . 
A security guard called the emergency services and the singer was eventually taken to hospital , where he was pronounced dead . 
During the two-hour recording , Dr Murray said he wished Jackson no harm , and in fact had been attempting to wean the singer off propofol in his final days . 
He acknowledged that he had given the singer propofol every day for the past two months . 
`` He was my friend . 
He opened up to me in different ways . 
I wanted to help him ... I cared for him . 
I had no intention of hurting him . 
I did not want him to fail . '' 
But he added : `` I realized Michael Jackson had a dependency and I was trying to wean him off it . ''

2011-10-12,"Michael Jackson did not cause own death , says doctor Dr Christopher Rogers : `` It 's reasonable to believe that the doctor had an imperfect control over the dose '' Michael Jackson could not have given himself the powerful anesthetic that caused his death , the medic who carried out the singer 's autopsy has testified . 
Dr Christopher Rogers said it was more likely Jackson 's personal physician Conrad Murray mistakenly gave him too much of the drug propofol to try to help him sleep . 
He added Dr Murray had no precision dosing device in Jackson 's bedroom . 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter . 
His lawyers claim Jackson gave himself the fatal dose while Dr Murray was out of the room . 
The doctor told police , in an interview heard in court last week , that he was away from Jackson 's bed for only two minutes on 25 June 2009 to go to the bathroom , and returned to find the singer was not breathing . 
However Dr Rogers testified that Jackson - who was already heavily sedated - would not have been able to inject a lethal dose of propofol before Murray returned . 
`` The circumstances , from my point of view , do not support self-administration of propofol , '' the chief of forensic medicine at the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office said . 
Dr Murray has admitted to giving Jackson 25ml of the drug to help him sleep , and would have had to give regular extra doses to keep the singer unconscious . 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter Dr Rogers said evidence found in Jackson 's bedroom included an empty 100ml bottle of propofol . 
But he noted that as Dr Murray had no accurate equipment to check the doses being administered , `` essentially , the doctor would be estimating how much propofol he was giving '' . 
`` I think it would be easy under those circumstances for the doctor to estimate wrong and give too much propofol , '' Dr Rogers said . 
He also noted the lack of sophisticated medical equipment in Jackson 's bedroom where the drugs were administered , such as resuscitation equipment . 
Dr Rogers said the cause of death was `` acute propofol intoxication '' , ruling the death a homicide . 
The trial in Los Angeles Superior Court is expected to last five weeks , until the end of October . 
If Dr Murray is convicted , he faces up to four years in jail .

2011-10-12,"Conrad Murray drops claim Jackson swallowed propofol Dr Murray say he was trying to wean Michael Jackson off using propofol for his insomnia Lawyers for Dr Conrad Murray have stepped back from claims that Michael Jackson swallowed a fatal dose of propofol when he was out of sight . 
The claim had been a key argument in Dr Murray 's defense at the trial over the superstar 's death . 
They may still argue he injected the dose himself . 
The change came a day after the doctor who performed Jackson 's autopsy said he could not have self-administered it . 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter . 
If convicted Dr Murray could face up to four years in prison and the loss of his medical licence . 
Both the prosecution and Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor appeared surprised by Wednesday 's disclosure , reports said . 
J Michael Flanagan , one of Dr Murray 's lawyers , said he had commissioned a study about the effects of swallowed propofol . 
Mr Flanagan said the effects from swallowing propofol , a powerful anesthetic that Dr Murray injected to relieve Jackson 's insomnia , would be `` trivial '' . 
`` We are not going to assert at any time during this trial that Michael Jackson orally administered propofol , '' Mr Flanagan said . 
Dr Christopher Rogers : `` It 's reasonable to believe that the doctor had an imperfect control over the dose '' The disclosure was made in court but not in front of jurors , the Associated Press reported . 
Lead defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said during opening statements on 27 September that his team would try to show that Jackson gave himself the fatal dose of propofol . 
On Tuesday , Dr Christopher Rogers said it was more likely Jackson 's Dr Murray mistakenly gave Jackson too much of the drug in an effort to help him sleep . 
`` The circumstances , from my point of view , do not support self-administration of propofol , '' the chief of forensic medicine at the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office said .

2011-10-12,"12 October 2011 Last updated at 20:01 GMT Help The legal team representing Michael Jackson 's personal doctor has dropped its claim that the pop star swallowed a fatal dose of the anesthetic Propofol while the medic was not looking . 
Dr Conrad Murray is on trial charged with involuntary manslaughter following Jackson 's death in June 2009 . 
He has pleaded not guilty . 
The BBC 's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles said that the move was a huge about turn by Dr Murray 's defense . 
"
2011-10-13,"Every day is a lottery at the trial of Conrad Murray , Michael Jackson 's doctor , who stands accused of killing perhaps the world 's most famous singer . 
Jackson fans line up against the courtroom wall at 07:30 every morning in the hope of winning a draw for one of the few seats in the public gallery . 
Like millions of others across America and the world they could watch it on the internet or on TV , but there is obviously something more to be gained from being there in person , sitting just a few feet from the lawyers , the family and the accused . 
I joined the draw two days in a row - second-time lucky - to get a feel for the courtroom and to immerse myself in a trial that has been creating a buzz across America . 
It was an interesting day to sit in on the trial . 
It was a day which began with what the TV pundits called a `` cornerstone of the defense '' being pulled away , and went on to hear some damning accusations of `` gross negligence '' against the man whom Michael Jackson trusted as his doctor . 
Before proceedings even began , before the 16 men and women of the jury had been buzzed into their seats , the defense had conceded Michael Jackson could not have drunk the drug which killed him . 
Propofol is what it the trial all about . 
It is is an extremely strong sedative and Michael Jackson was having his doctor use it to help him get to sleep . 
It was a combination of that and a number of other sedatives which caused his death - and as the man prescribing the pills , injections and intravenous drugs , Conrad Murray stands accused of causing his death by involuntary manslaughter . 
One key line of defense is that Michael Jackson took the drugs himself , when his doctor was not looking . 
A presumption made by the countless commentators , TV experts , ex-prosecutors and journalists was that Michael Jackson drank the drug . 
But research by both the prosecution and the defense proved it was only effective if injected straight into the blood . 
And so a line of questioning defense lawyers may have used , and indeed hinted they would use , was dropped - but not the theory of self-medication altogether . 
Jackson could have injected himself , or taken other pills , but that is for another day of evidence or for when the defense case begins . 
But this day was all about independent medical experts and their professional opinion of Dr Murray . 
They were not impressed . 
For much of the day cardiologist Dr Alon Steinberg was in the stand , describing how he had reviewed Dr Murray 's own account of what happened the night Michael Jackson died , as told to a detective . 
He outlined six separate instances of what he called `` gross negligence . '' 
`` Propofol should never be given as a sleeping drug , '' was his premise , explaining it was a strong sedative used as an anesthetic in surgical operations and its use in this way was negligent and unethical . 
Once given the drug , Michael Jackson should have been monitored properly , all the time , with heart and blood pressure monitors , back-up drugs and equipment in case anything went wrong . 
And perhaps most damning of all , he said the way Conrad Murray reacted when Jackson stopped breathing was `` responsible for the singer 's death '' . 
By not immediately calling the emergency services , taking the wrong action in those vital few minutes and not having prepared for an emergency , he had made `` a direct contribution to Michael Jackson 's death '' , Dr Steinberg told the court . 
The second witness , Professor Nader Kamangar , was equally critical of the use of such a powerful sedative which he said required proper training and was usually given in a hospital or clinical environment , not in someone 's home . 
He also reviewed Conrad Murray 's account of what happened , and as a sleep medicine expert stressed propofol should not be used for insomnia . 
The two independent witnesses helped build up a strong picture of a poor doctor who did not follow basic procedure and was negligent . 
It is a picture the defense will be keen to undermine in the cross-examination of Prof Kamangar , with the prosecution continuing to build its case against Conrad Murray as the trial approaches its half-way mark . 
Meanwhile the Jackson fans will keep on arriving for the daily lottery , to secure one of those precious seats in the courtroom .

2011-10-19,"Conrad Murray ` responsible ' for Michael Jackson 's death Dr Steven Shafer : '' ` Yes ' is not what a doctor says to a patient request that is not in their best interest . '' 
Michael Jackson 's doctor made 17 flagrant violations when administering propofol to the star , an expert on the potent anesthetic has told the court . 
Dr Steven Shafer said the drug should never be used to treat insomnia and Dr Conrad Murray 's negligence was directly responsible for Jackson 's death . 
The expert called Dr Murray `` clueless '' about the drug that contributed to the 50-year-old singer 's June 2009 death . 
Dr Murray denies involuntary manslaughter of the star . 
Dr Shafer , who helped write the guidance on every bottle of propofol , told the Los Angeles court that Dr Murray did not know how to respond when the star stopped breathing . 
He said of Dr Murray 's delay in calling 911 : `` I almost do n't know what to say . 
That is so completely and utterly inexcusable . '' 
The Columbia University professor said propofol should never be taken as a sleeping aid . 
`` We are in pharmacological never-never land here , something that was done to Michael Jackson and no one else in history to my knowledge , '' he told the jury . 
The expert in anaesthesiology also said Dr Murray had acted like the pop star 's obedient `` employee '' and not his doctor , who should have refused the star 's requests for propofol . 
Dr Conrad Murray -LRB- right -RRB- denies involuntary manslaughter of the pop star `` Saying ` yes ' is not what doctors do , '' said Dr Shafer . 
`` A competent doctor would know you do not do this . '' 
Dr Shafer testified that Dr Murray should have taken minute-by-minute notes of Jackson 's condition while he was under the influence of propofol . 
He said Dr Murray 's lack of record keeping had been a denial of Jackson 's rights . 
Dr Shafer also criticised Dr Murray for talking on the phone in the hours before Jackson 's death . 
The anaesthesiology expert said doctors should never multi-task while monitoring a sedated patient . 
`` A patient who is about to die does not look all that different from a patient who is OK , '' he said . 
Dr Shafer is expected to be the prosecution 's final witness , and his testimony will continue on Thursday .

2011-10-24,"Detective Orlando Martinez was one of the first defense witnesses called Lawyers defending Conrad Murray , Michael Jackson 's doctor , have called their first witnesses . 
They will have to counter four weeks of testimony from prosecution witnesses , who alleged that Dr Murray acted unethically and with gross negligence Dr Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in a Los Angeles court . 
Among the first witnesses were a doctor and a nurse practitioner , who had both previously treated or counselled Jackson . 
Dr Allan Metzger , a friend of Jackson 's for over two decades , testified that Jackson had requested anaesthetics from him as a sleep aid . 
During their cross-examination , prosecutors used the same testimony to show that other medical professionals rejected using intravenous or oral anaesthetics to help Jackson sleep . 
Cherilyn Lee , a holistic nurse practitioner who treated Jackson with vitamin infusions , testified that she urged Jackson to undergo a sleep study for his insomnia , but he refused , saying he did n't have enough time . 
Ms Lee , who has spoken publicly about Jackson requesting propofol from her , is expected to tell jurors about further exchanges with the late singer when she continues testifying on Tuesday . 
The defense also questioned Detectives Dan Myers and Orlando Martinez about testimony from bodyguard Alberto Alvarez . 
Mr Alvarez said that after Jackson 's breathing stopped , Dr Murray told him to place equipment and vials into a bag before calling the 911 emergency service . 
The defense has contended that Mr Alvarez may have changed his story after a coroner 's official report was released . 
Dr Murray is not expected to testify , but the defense has said they will call their own propofol expert to counter testimony of anaesthesiologist Steven Shafer , the prosecution witness who testified for five days . 
Defense lawyers argued in opening statements that Jackson could have drunk an extra dose of propofol , but later told the court they would drop the argument based on their own studies . 
Prosecutors have portrayed Dr Murray as grossly negligent for administering the drug outside of a hospital setting . 
The defense has argued that he was trying to wean a troubled Jackson off the drug , and that the pop superstar , desperate for sleep during rehearsals for a planned comeback concert , administered the fatal dose himself . 
Correspondents say that with multiple witnesses already called on Monday , the case could go to the jury as early as the end of this week .

2011-10-26,"Michael Jackson ` warned about propofol use ' Cherilyn Lee fought back tears as she gave her testimony on Tuesday Singer Michael Jackson was warned by a nurse practitioner about using the sedative propofol to help him sleep , a Los Angeles court has heard . 
Cherilyn Lee said Jackson told her that Diprivan - a brand name for propofol - was the only thing that would knock him out and induce the sleep he needed . 
Ms Lee was testifying on Tuesday at the involuntary manslaughter trial of the singer 's physician , Dr Conrad Murray . 
His lawyers have told the judge they would not be calling him to the stand . 
Lee , a nutritionist and holistic nurse , was called to testify for the defense . 
She told jurors she had tried to give Jackson natural remedies to deal with his insomnia and had told him propofol was too dangerous to be used at his home . 
Under cross-examination by the prosecution , the tearful witness acknowledged a conversation with the singer in which she told him : `` No one who cared or had your best interest at heart would give you this . '' 
After refusing to supply him with the drug in April 2009 , she continued , she never saw Jackson again . 
Dr Conrad Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter The superstar died on 25 June that year , a death the Los Angeles coroner subsequently attributed to `` acute propofol intoxication '' . 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter , arguing that Jackson self-administered the dose that killed him . 
If convicted he could face up to four years in prison and the loss of his medical licence . 
Dr Murray was hired in May 2009 by promoters AEG Live to be the star 's personal physician ahead of a 50-date concert comeback in London . 
His defense team had wanted to introduce Jackson 's contract to show he would have owed $ 40 million -LRB- # 25m -RRB- to the promoter if the concerts were canceled . 
The lawyers had wanted to argue that Jackson would have been desperate to make sure the shows continued and needed sleep to get through rehearsals . 
But Judge Pastor said there was no evidence Jackson was concerned about the money and allowing testimony about the contract might confuse jurors . 
`` This is not a contractual dispute , '' he said on Tuesday . 
`` This is a homicide case . '' 
It is believed the case , now in its fifth week , could go to the jury by the end of this week .

2011-10-27,"Conrad Murray trial : Jackson ` addicted to Demerol ' Dr Robert Waldman : `` I believe there is evidence that he was dependent upon Demerol . '' 
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter . 
His lawyers claim Jackson gave himself the fatal dose while Dr Murray was out of the room . 
The defense also called their own propofol expert , Dr Paul White . 
Dr White told the court on Thursday he said he would not have expected the pop superstar to be killed from the drugs which Dr Murray said he had given to the singer . 
He is the last witness for the defense and is expected to continue testifying on Friday , including giving an alternate theory about how Jackson died . 
However , because of a late admission by the defense that Dr White would be using a new computer simulation to illustrate his theory , Judge Michael Pastor has given prosecutors the weekend to analyze the data before cross-examining the defense 's expert . 
Prosecutors told the judge they were surprised by the new development and needed time to study the software program . 
Lawyers for Dr Conrad Murray have moved quickly through witnesses since beginning their case earlier this week , including former patients of the doctor . 
Dr Waldman was testifying largely in the place of Dr Arnold Klein , Jackson 's dermatologist . 
Using Dr Klein as a witness was ruled out in the trial because his care of Jackson was not being investigated . 
Using the dermatologist 's records , he testified that over three days in April 2009 , Jackson received 775mg of Demerol , during the same period that Dr Murray was giving Jackson propofol . 
Dr Waldman told jurors that was a `` large dose '' for a dermatology procedure in an office . 
On cross-examination , however , prosecutor David Walgren asked Dr Waldman about legal obligations for doctors , including a requirement to keep accurate and detailed records . 
Dr Murray told police he had kept no records on his treatment of Jackson . 
Dr Paul White said after reading documents regarding the case he was `` perplexed '' . 
`` I would not have expected Michael Jackson to have died , '' if the dose Dr Murray said he had given Jackson was correct . 
But if Jackson 's doctor did in fact put him on an IV drip of propofol and leave him unattended , Dr White said he could not justify it , AP reports .

2011-11-01,"Conrad Murray decides not to give evidence Defense lawyers for Dr Conrad Murray say they will call no further witnesses Dr Conrad Murray has told a judge he will not testify in his own defense in the trial over Michael Jackson 's death . 
He denies involuntary manslaughter but could face a prison term and the loss of his medical licence if convicted . 
Dr Murray told trial Judge Michael Pastor he had made his decision `` freely and explicitly '' , reports said . 
The decision comes after the defense called its last witness , propofol expert Dr Paul White . 
Closing statements will begin on Thursday . 
`` My decision is I will not testify in this matter , '' Dr Murray said after being asked if he understood the choice to testify or not was his alone . 
Throughout the 22-day trial , both the prosecution and defense have called their own medical experts to take the stand . 
On Tuesday , the prosecution called their own propofol expert , Dr Steven Shafer , as a rebuttal witness to counter arguments put forth by Dr White . 
During earlier testimony , Dr Shafer said the suggestion that Jackson could have drugged himself was `` crazy '' . 
The defense called former patients of Dr Murray as character witnesses , and tried to introduce doubt into the testimony of the prosecution 's witnesses . 
Defense lawyers have argued that Jackson , dealing with insomnia , drugged himself with an additional dose of propofol after Dr Murray left his bedroom . 
They dropped their original contention that Jackson drank the propofol but maintained that he had intravenously administered the fatal dose himself . 
Paramedics were called to Jackson 's California home on 25 June 2009 after he stopped breathing . 
He was pronounced dead two hours later at the UCLA medical center . 
The prosecution alleges Jackson died from an overdose of the anesthetic drug propofol and that Dr Murray was negligent by giving him the drug outside of a hospital setting .

2011-11-04,"Dr Conrad Murray was hired by Jackson after becoming friends in 2006 When Michael Jackson died on 25 June 2009 , Dr Conrad Murray was at the hospital for the pop superstar , who had hired him as his personal physician and considered him a friend . 
Months later , the 58-year-old was charged with Jackson 's death and became a hate figure to the singer 's legions of fans around the world . 
Raised by his grandparents in Grenada in poverty , Dr Murray worked his way up to become a successful cardiologist in the US . 
A series of financial and personal problems seemed to be ending after a chance meeting in Las Vegas with Michael Jackson led to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . 
Dr Murray was hired at Jackson 's request to be the star 's personal physician ahead of his 50-date series of London concerts , This Is It . 
Raised by his maternal grandparents , Dr Murray proved a hard-working student , eventually following his absent father , also a doctor , to the US - where he enrolled at Texas Southern University . 
He graduated three years later with a degree in pre-medicine and biological sciences . 
He continued his medical studies in Nashville , Tennessee , before completing his training in California and the University of Arizona , where he studied cardiology . 
In 2000 , he opened his own practice in Las Vegas , expanding with a second clinic in Houston in 2006 . 
Like his father , he took pride serving both ends of the community , and provided medical care to deprived areas . 
However , Dr Murray 's apparent success was blighted by outstanding debts and tax demands . 
Reports suggest he filed for bankruptcy in 2002 while living in California . 
The doctor 's financial problems stemmed by providing medical care for the poor , his lawyers have said . 
He had not paid the mortgage on his home in months when Jackson offered him the job as his personal physician . 
Other unpaid bills and debts loomed . 
Dr Murray met Michael Jackson when the singer 's daughter , Paris , was sick during a family trip to Las Vegas in 2006 . 
According to Dr Murray 's spokeswoman , someone within Jackson 's group knew the doctor and called Dr Murray to treat her . 
They remained friendly and Jackson hired the physician in May 2009 . 
He was to be paid $ 150,000 -LRB- # 96,000 -RRB- a month . 
`` As a company , we would have preferred not having a physician on staff full-time because it would have been cheaper ... but Michael was insistent that he be hired , '' promoter AEG 's Randy Phillips told the Associated Press . 
`` Michael said he had a rapport with him . '' 
Dr Murray 's lawyer , Edward Chernoff , said the case had put his client in fear of his life and he had to be accompanied `` 24\/7 with a bodyguard '' . 
The prosecution called Dr Murray 's girlfriends to testify `` He ca n't operate his practice , '' said the attorney . 
`` He ca n't go to work because he is harassed no matter where he goes . '' 
According to public records cited by the LA Times , Dr Murray had two children with his wife , but also fathered several children with different women . 
Those children included the now young toddler of Nicole Alvarez , an actress who met Dr Murray in 2005 . 
Several of Dr Murray 's recent girlfriends have also testified at his trial , as well as former patients . 
According to court records , he has been sued more than 10 times , including for breach of contract and unpaid child support . 
He has never been sued for malpractice .

2011-11-04,"Conrad Murray jury to return after weekend Prosecutors ended their case by saying Dr Conrad Murray 's care of Jackson had been `` bizarre '' , while the defense said the singer had caused his own death . 
The panel will resume considering the involuntary manslaughter charge against Dr Conrad Murray on Monday . 
Fans of Jackson , who died in June 2009 , gathered outside the Los Angeles court , carrying signs asking for a `` one way ticket to jail '' for the accused . 
If convicted , Dr Murray , 58 , could face four years in prison and lose his licence to practice medicine . 
The cardiologist denies giving Jackson an overdose of the powerful sedative propofol to help him sleep . 
The jury of seven men and five women heard from 49 witnesses and saw more than 300 pieces of evidence over the six weeks of the trial . 
Dr Conrad Murray chose not to testify in his own defense There was no sign of Dr Murray on Friday or his legal team , but they are to receive a two-hour notice once a verdict is reached . 
During closing statements on Thursday , the prosecution said the world had lost a `` genius '' , while the defense characterised Murray as `` a little fish in a big dirty pond '' . 
Prosecutors said Dr Murray 's care of the pop star had been `` bizarre '' and left the pop star 's children fatherless . 
They projected images of Jackson 's grief-stricken children on a giant screen . 
The children , Prince , Paris and Blanket , who range in ages from 9 to 14 , were not in court on Thursday , but Jackson 's parents and several of his siblings were present . 
Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said the accused had caused the star 's death through negligence and greed , and had essentially been experimenting on Jackson . 
The defense countered that the singer had caused his own death by injecting a dose of propofol while his doctor was out of the room . 
`` They want you to convict Dr Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson , '' defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said . 
Dr Murray chose not to testify in his own defense .

2011-11-07,"By Andrew Cohen The Atlantic Murray will be sentenced on 29 November , and was held without bail after his conviction The last doctor of Michael Jackson 's life was convicted of manslaughter by a California jury because the law demanded it and the facts supported it . 
Dr Conrad Murray was at Jackson 's home when the pop star died , sloppily administering medicine that should only have been administered in a hospital . 
There are , I suspect , few jurors in the world who would have gone out of their way to search for a more complex narrative in order to spare the defendant a few years or months in jail . 
Throughout the trial , Murray 's lawyers tried gingerly to blame Jackson himself for his own death , a tactic which reflected both the desperation of the defense case and the nature of California 's involuntary manslaughter statute . 
Team Murray hoped that if jurors blamed the singer himself for an overdose , they might mete out a measure of sympathy for a doctor who , like so many other doctors who treat celebrities , thought he had his patient under control when he did not . 
California law , however , makes this a very difficult proposition . 
It is not enough to demonstrate , as Murray 's lawyers did , that the victim of the crime contributed to his own death . 
Even if Jackson injected himself with the drug that ultimately killed him , prosecutors told jurors in closing arguments , Murray should have foreseen that this would occur because he knew that Jackson liked to `` push '' his own drugs . 
Given this standard , what chance did Murray ever really have ? 
The rest of world envisioned a tragic end for Jackson ... After covering his 2005 molestation trial I certainly did . 
Why did n't Murray ? '' 
The prosecution 's theory resonated with the jury because it was founded on the language of the statute as announced during jury instructions . 
But when you stop and think about it , it is truly an extraordinary thing . 
California is about to send a man to prison - for a while anyway - even though many reasonable people would agree that Jackson played a prominent role in his own death . 
The law says that Murray should have known better , even if Jackson did not ; that the doctor had a responsibility to his patient even if his patient were bent on pushing past medically acceptable standards . 
You could say , as Murray 's lawyers implied , that the good doctor was in the wrong place at the wrong time . 
They acknowledged , as they had to , that their client 's professional performance during the fatal episode was not what any of us would want from our own bedside doctors . 
But the defense lawyers tried to take the mens rea element , the criminal element , out of the case . 
Murray may have been a quack , they argued , but he had absolutely no bad intent toward the richest patient he or any private doctor was ever likely to have . 
Or you could say , as prosecutors did , that any good doctor would not have come anywhere near the circus that was Jackson 's relationship with prescription drugs . 
How long Murray will spend behind bars is up to Judge Michael Pastor Murray did not officially represent the King of Pop for long . 
But like everyone else in the world he surely knew that he was taking on a patient with a reputation for using drugs to try to tune out the demons which afflicted him . 
The rest of world envisioned a tragic end for Jackson along these lines . 
After covering his 2005 molestation trial I certainly did . 
Why did n't Murray ? 
The just-completed trial was a good one , in which the lawyers ably represented their causes and the trial judge , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor , did a laudable job keeping control of a celebrity case . 
On 29 November , during sentencing , I believe that Judge Pastor will show more mercy to Murray than did his jurors . 
Murray faces anywhere from probation to four years , but it is clear from the fact that he is now in jail - the judge denied bail pending sentencing - that Judge Pastor is going to give him some prison time . 
My bet is that the sentence will be towards the lower side . 
California 's prisons are notoriously overcrowded . 
In fact , the state has been forced by the United States Supreme Court to reduce the prison population to more manageable levels . 
Michael Jackson 's billion or so fans may argue that Conrad Murray deserves the hardest time possible . 
But the truth of the matter is that the eternal law of economics is on Murray 's side . 
He made terrible errors in judgment , and he 's paying the price . 
And none of that will ever bring back Michael Jackson or tell us what next might have happened had he lived through that day .

Always someone else 's fault . 
Frankly mj was running himself to an early grave long before Murray had the misfortune of meeting him . 
It 's just a shame that Jackson could n't have just got his head down and led a quiet life outside of his music career . 
9th November 2011 - 7:46 Oh please . 
When the doctor decided to take all that money from Michael Jackson , he immediately began to violate his professional oath -- `` do no harm '' . 
He took the job for the money and should suffer as much as the law allows for it . 
He administered an illegal drug in an illegal situation , left the scene of the crime ; in fright waited to call 911 ; and then lied to them about it all . 
All posts are reactively-moderated and must obey the house rules .

2011-11-07,"By David Willis BBC News , Los Angeles Michael Jackson died in June 2009 Michael Jackson was in good spirits . 
With less than three weeks to go before the start of a series of comeback concerts at London 's O2 arena even he , the ultimate perfectionist , had to admit things were looking good . 
After viewing the video clips that would accompany such classic hits as Billie Jean and She 's Out of My Life , Jackson had led the company in their first dress rehearsal of Thriller . 
When it was over he hugged the dancers and thanked the crew . 
Several of those who were present that night at the Los Angeles Staples Center said he was grinning from ear to ear . 
It was a little after one o'clock in the morning by the time Jackson returned to the French chateau-style mansion he had been renting on the outskirts of Beverly Hills . 
Waiting for him in his bedroom on the first floor was Conrad Murray . 
Tall and softly-spoken , Dr Murray had grown up on the Caribbean island of Grenada and like his father , who was also a doctor , moved to America in the hope of making a better life for himself . 
He had been introduced to Michael Jackson three years previously by a patient who had worked for Jackson . 
On the night in question Dr Murray had served as the singer 's personal physician for barely two months . 
Nevertheless , he was familiar with the routine . 
Once Michael Jackson had emerged from the shower Dr Murray applied cream to his back to treat a pigmentation disorder known as vitiligo and the two men then settled into the more challenging aspect of their nightly ritual : getting Jackson to sleep . 
Experience had taught Dr Murray that this could be a prolonged routine . 
On this occasion it was to last until well after sunrise . 
Fast forward to a little after noon on the same day and the calm of the eight-bedroom mansion was shattered by the sound of shouting from Jackson 's bedroom - followed a few minutes later by the sound of people racing up the stairs . 
Paramedics responding to a call about a 50-year-old man suffering cardiac arrest found Michael Jackson sprawled across the floor in his pyjamas with a surgical cap on his head . 
Oxygen tanks littered the doorway ; a child-sized porcelain doll lay on the bed . 
The heating was on - despite the fact that this was the middle of summer - and sweat was pouring down Dr Murray 's face as he attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . 
Dr Murray has admitted to administering propofol to Jackson in his bedroom But one look at Jackson 's limp , lifeless body told the paramedics there was nothing they could do . 
His pupils were already dilated and his skin cold to the touch . 
The faux French chateau , which Michael Jackson had been renting in LA - for a reported $ 100,000 -LRB- # 62,000 -RRB- a month - had seen some illustrious neighbors . 
Barbra Streisand , Frank Sinatra , Mick Jagger and Cher had all called the same street home . 
But the fact that Jackson 's all-time idol Elvis Presley had once lived just around the corner may ultimately have been what persuaded him to move there . 
Minutes after the news broke of Jackson 's death that same street - a stone 's throw from Sunset Boulevard - was swarming with reporters . 
News helicopters hovered overhead , satellite trucks jammed the side streets . 
It had been more than four years since I - or any other journalist present that day - had last seen Jackson . 
That was in the town of Santa Maria , in the heart of California wine country , following his acquittal on charges of child sex abuse in 2005 . 
Covering that trial every day for nearly four months I was struck by the effect the proceedings seemed to have on Jackson 's wellbeing . 
We all remember the pictures of him shuffling into court in his pyjamas but there were times when he almost seemed to be withering away in front of our very eyes as details of his unorthodox lifestyle were dished up for the world to see . 
Jackson considered the charges against him outrageous and the documentary which prompted them a `` betrayal '' . 
Although the verdict went in his favor , there was little doubt in my mind that he left Santa Maria a broken man . 
Unsurprisingly perhaps , friends say it was around the time of that court case that Jackson started finding it increasingly difficult to get to sleep . 
He had suffered from a variety of ailments over the years but none compared to the torment he endured once the lights went out . 
`` I once said Michael would have paid a $ 1m for a good night 's sleep and though I was being somewhat facetious , in many ways it was true , '' Jackson 's biographer J Randy Taraborrelli told the BBC . 
Fans of Jackson have waited outside the Los Angeles courthouse throughout the six-week long trial `` When stressed out he could n't sleep . 
Michael told me once that when he went to bed he could n't stop the creative process . 
`` He was always creating , imagining , wondering how things would work out and what he could do to make them better . ' 
I ca n't turn it off ' was how he put it to me . ' 
I wish I could . 
But I ca n't ' . '' 
Meaning that the more he needed it , the more elusive sleep became . 
Hence the decision to go `` doctor shopping '' in a quest to find someone who would prescribe the one substance he knew could save him from sleeplessness . 
Dr Conrad Murray told detectives he first became aware of propofol after he allowed another doctor to treat Jackson at his surgery in Las Vegas . 
Jackson slept soundly and when he awoke the two men discussed the possibility of Murray accompanying Michael Jackson to London . 
Dr Murray , who throughout that interview referred to Jackson as a `` friend '' , initially asked for $ 5m . 
When the tour promoters , who were footing the bill on the Jackson 's behalf , baulked at that price he agreed to lower it to $ 150,000 a month . 
Those who knew Michael Jackson well all seem to agree on one thing . 
Gifted though he was as an entertainer - and , at times , as a businessman - as a judge of character his skills frequently left something to be desired . 
Jackson 's sister La Toya referred to the `` shadowy entourage '' of handlers who frequently attached themselves to him like barnacles to a ship . 
Michael Jackson 's previous Los Angeles home Neverland Over the years there was a virtual `` revolving door '' of assistants and advisors , many of whom seemed to bring a lot less to the table than they took from it . 
`` Michael put his trust in a lot of people over the years , '' said Mr Taraborrelli . 
`` He always gave people the benefit of the doubt . 
He would wait until a person proved him wrong before that person would be ousted from his life . 
-LRB- In some cases -RRB- he waited too long . '' 
The tragedy of this tale is that it could all have ended so very differently . 
Once the concerts at London 's O2 arena had come to an end Michael Jackson was planning to take the show on a worldwide tour and use the proceeds to build a hospital for disadvantaged children , headed - you 've guessed it - by Dr Conrad Murray . 
He also intended to spend more time with his three children - Paris , Prince and Prince Michael II , known as Blanket - whom he was raising alone . 
The mansion he once occupied may also have changed hands effortlessly had he survived . 
Yet with Neverland long-since closed and Jackson 's grave off-limits to anyone other than family and friends , it has become - by default - a focal point for fans desperate for a link to their hero , no matter how macabre that link may be . 
Which almost certainly was not what the owner - the head of the Ed Hardy fashion chain - had in mind when he bought the place . 
He has made two attempts to sell it since Michael Jackson died but has yet to attract a buyer .

2011-11-08,"Page last updated at 08:14 GMT , Tuesday , 8 November 2011 Propofol is a fast-acting hospital sedative used before anaesthetics Michael Jackson 's physician , Doctor Conrad Murray , has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter by a jury in Los Angeles . 
During the trial they were shown images of the singer lying dead in a hospital and rehearsing the day before his death . 
The prosecution team claimed Conrad Murray was an incompetent physician who used an anesthetic called Propofol without the proper safeguards . 
The defense said Jackson caused his own death by taking a drug overdose , including Propofol , after Murray left his bedroom on the day of his death . 
Find out what drugs were found in Michael Jackson 's body . 
Propofol is a fast-acting hospital sedative , administered intravenously and used before anaesthetics . 
It was first used widely in the late 1980s . 
The drug , which Conrad Murray gave to the singer to help him sleep , is made by the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and is also sold under the brand name Diprivan . 
The prosecution team said Murray used large quantities of Propofol Experts say Propofol is extremely powerful and not meant for use outside hospitals and clinics . 
Propofol was referred to by Michael Jackson as his `` milk '' because of the milk-like appearance . 
The drug is administered either by intravenous drip or by being injected ahead of an anesthetic , or to keep a patient anesthetized during an operation . 
It is a preferred sedative in operating theaters because it is well tolerated and allows patients to recover quicker . 
It 's commonly used in outpatient surgery or as a sedative for certain examinations . 
Propofol is also used as a painkiller or anti-anxiety drug in post-operative care . 
Conrad Murray told police in 2009 that he gave Michael Jackson other drugs known as benzodiazepines , which are also used as sleep aids . 
But when they did not work , he claimed Jackson demanded Propofol . 
Murray 's defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said the singer swallowed several pills of Lorazepam on the morning of his death , enough to put six people to sleep . 
It is widely used as a sedative and muscle relaxant . 
Also known as Ativan and Temesta , the drug is used short-term for insomnia , anxiety , seizures and for sedating aggressive patients . 
Midazolam is used in a similar way to Lorazepam . 
It is widely used as a sedative and to treat seizures . 
Also know as Dormicum , Hypnovel and Versed , the drug is also used short-term to treat severe insomnia and anxiety . 
Jackson was given four milligrams of the drug on the morning of his death . 
Diazepam is better known as Valium . 
It 's used as a relaxant for patients suffering from insomnia and anxiety as well as seizures . 
Michael Jackson was given a 10 milligram tablet of Diazepam at 1.30 am on the morning of his death because he could n't sleep . 
Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and is sometimes used to treat skin inflammations . 
It is used by dentists to anaesthetise patients ' gums . 
Michael Jackson had a dose of Propofol diluted with Lidocaine at 10.40 am on the day of his death . 
It is primarily used as an appetite suppressant and stimulant .

2011-11-08,"Page last updated at 06:56 GMT , Tuesday , 8 November 2011 Newsbeat US reporter in Los Angeles It had just gone 11am on the ninth floor of the courthouse in downtown Los Angeles when the three buzzes were heard . 
It came from the jury room and was the signal to say they had reached their verdict . 
Bored journalists waiting around inside suddenly grabbed their phones and scrambled for the exit . 
After more than six weeks the trial of Michael Jackson 's doctor , Conrad Murray , was about to reach its climax . 
It took just a few seconds for the news to filter through to fans gathered outside . 
There were excited screams and cheers with one man yelling : `` This is it for Conrad Murray . 
Now 's the time . '' 
Hundreds of fans gathered outside the court in downtown Los Angeles The judge ordered a two-hour delay before the verdict was read to give the families involved and the media time to prepare . 
During that period the hardcore Michael Jackson fans who 'd been there every day were joined by dozens more people , many of them just curious to see what all the fuss was about . 
With the pavement getting busier and the chants of `` guilty '' getting louder , Michael Jackson 's family pulled up in a fleet of blacked out limousines . 
His mother and father waved to the crowd as they made their way inside . 
Fans then huddled around their smartphones and laptops trying to get a signal to watch the live feed from inside the court . 
Most of them were unsuccessful but some managed to watch the moment the verdict was read . 
Jayda Bates , 17 , was emotional when the decision came through At first just a couple of people yelled , `` he 's guilty '' , before a ripple of cheers became an eruption when everyone realized the outcome . 
Jayda Bates was in tears : `` I 'm just so happy that Michael has finally got some justice . 
Conrad Murray deserves this moment . 
`` He 's had it coming for a long time . '' 
Shortly afterwards an ambulance arrived to treat someone who had fainted . 
Lesley Cole was outside the court for most of the trial : `` It 's crazy here right now but I 'm so glad I did n't miss it . 
Justice is going to be served now , I hope . '' 
While the majority of fans were outside , a few had managed to get tickets to watch the verdict inside the courtroom . 
Felicia Gilliam was one of them : `` I was sitting on the edge of my seat . 
There was a lot of tension in there . 
Felicia Gilliam was sitting near the Jackson family in the courtroom `` My stomach was boiling and bubbling just waiting for the verdict to be read . 
`` I was looking at the jury to see who they were , how they looked . 
`` I was two seats away from the Jackson family . 
One of the Jackson nieces hollered out and you could see Michael Jackson 's mother holding her hand . '' 
After a couple of hours the police were getting impatient with Michael Jackson fans blocking the pavements outside court and asked them to leave . 
Many of them will be back in a few weeks on 29 November when Conrad Murray is sentenced . 
He 's expected to serve up to four years in prison .

2011-11-11,"Michael Jackson doctor Conrad Murray gives TV interview Dr Murray was speaking to Steve Hewlett for a Channel 4 documentary , The Man Who Killed Michael Jackson , which aired on Thursday night Dr Conrad Murray , who was convicted of the involuntary manslaughter of Michael Jackson , has defended his actions in a television interview . 
Speaking to Channel 4 , he maintained he had been trying to wean Jackson off propofol before the star 's death . 
But Dr Murray admitted it had been `` really stupid '' and `` careless '' not to keep notes of his treatment . 
`` Was this a mistake ? 
Absolutely , '' he said . 
`` But the absence of notes was not responsible for his death . '' 
Dr Murray did not give evidence during his six-week trial , which ended on Monday when a jury ruled he had given Jackson a fatal overdose of propofol . 
He spoke to journalist Steve Hewlett eight days before the verdict as part of a documentary called The Man Who Killed Michael Jackson . 
The pop star 's family have complained about the program , which is due to be screened in the US next week . 
under the title Michael Jackson and the Doctor : A Fatal Friendship . 
The executors of the pop star 's estate said Murray was getting a primetime platform to smear Jackson 's reputation without fear of cross-examination , and demanded that the screening be canceled . 
`` Like so many of Michael 's fans , the estate is ... disgusted by MSNBC 's irresponsible and inexplicable decision to air a Conrad Murray ` documentary ' , '' it said . 
Asked about Jackson 's use of propofol , Dr Murray said : `` I did not recommend it . 
I would never have recommended propofol to Mr Jackson '' . 
`` He needed to get rid of it and resume a more normal state of sleep . '' 
Using an analogy to explain his actions , he told Mr Hewlett : `` If I came to your house and you were a friend of mine and unexpectedly I saw you with a gun in your hand , I can do one of two things and maybe succeed . 
`` I can tell you stop it and you might listen to me , or I might take hours to get you to hand over that gun . 
So I would say , basically , it took me a while to take away from Michael something I thought he should not use . '' 
Describing the night when Jackson died , Dr Murray accounted for his actions in the one hour and 40 minutes between administering propofol and the emergency services being called . 
He said he had sat with Jackson , checking his vital signs until he believed the effects of the sedative had worn off , before moving to an adjacent room at 11:20 am . 
`` If you say : ` Dr Murray , that was really stupid , you should have had a look , ' then I agree , '' he said . 
Dr Murray added that he had not informed police or the ambulance crew that Jackson had taken the drug because `` they never asked me '' and `` I did not think it was important '' . 
The prosecution said Murray had caused Jackson 's death through negligence His comments echoed a similar interview given to the US breakfast television show Today earlier this week . 
`` I think propofol is not recommended to be given in the home setting , '' Dr Murray said during the interview . 
`` But it is not contraindicated . '' 
In court , the defense argued that Jackson was a drug addict who caused his own death by giving himself an extra dose of propofol while the cardiologist was out of the room at the star 's rented Los Angeles mansion . 
Murray told Today 's Savannah Guthrie he had not been distracted by phone calls , emails and text messages . 
`` When I looked at a man who was all night deprived of sleep , who was desperate for sleep and finally is getting some sleep , am I gonna sit over him , sit around him , tug on his feet , do anything unusual to wake him up ? 
No , '' Murray said . 
Asked if he was right to leave Jackson alone , he replied : `` Had I known what I know today in retrospect , that Mr Jackson was an addict - and he had shared that information with me - addicts may behave in a way that is unreasonable and you may consider it . '' 
Dr Murray , 58 , is due to be sentenced on 29 November and could receive a maximum prison term of four years and lose his licence to practice medicine .

2011-11-11,"Ricky Gervais comedy Life 's Too Short gets 2.5 m viewers Life 's Too Short is presented as a faux-documentary , in the vein of The Office and Extras Life 's Too Short , the new comedy by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant , attracted 2.5 million viewers for its BBC Two debut on Thursday . 
It stars Warwick Davis as an actor whose career on the slide , and hopes a reality show will reverse his fortunes . 
The audience was above the channel 's average for that timeslot - which is 1.8 m - but lower than that of Gervais and Merchant 's previous series , Extras . 
Religious sitcom Rev also fared well , with a record audience of 2.4 million . 
The BBC Two series , which stars Tom Hollander as a hapless vicar , returned for its second run . 
In its first season , the comedy had an average audience of 1.87 million . 
Gervais and Merchant appear as versions of themselves in Life 's Too Short , playing Davis ' agents . 
The show also features cameos from stars including Johnny Depp and Liam Neeson . 
It was conceived when Davis played a part in the duo 's previous comedy , Extras , in 2006 . 
Writing on the BBC 's TV blog , the actor , who is 3ft 6in -LRB- 1.06 m -RRB- , called this series the highlight of his career , ahead of roles in Return Of The Jedi and the Harry Potter franchise . 
`` Filming the series was one of the hardest things I 've ever done , but it was also the most fun , '' he said . 
But the opening episode fared less well than Extras , which averaged 3.67 million viewers for its second series , and peaked with five million for the feature-length Christmas finale . 
The most-watched programs in the UK last night were EastEnders , with 8.4 million viewers and Coronation Street , which was seen by 8.1 million . 
But Channel 4 's exclusive interview with Dr Conrad Murray , who was convicted of the involuntary manslaughter of pop star Michael Jackson this week , only attracted 757,000 viewers . 
It was a late addition to schedules that had not been heavily advertised .

2011-11-16,"Michael Jackson headboard withdrawn from auction The value of Michael Jackson memorabilia has increased since his death in 2009 The headboard from the bed in which Michael Jackson died has been withdrawn from auction at the request of his family , Julien 's Auctions has said . 
The antique furniture piece was among several of the star 's belongings which are being sold in December . 
`` We want to maintain a good relationship with the family and we do n't want to do anything upsetting for them , '' Darren Julien told Reuters . 
The auction is scheduled to take place on 17 December in the US . 
Watercolour paintings , antique furnishings and a chalkboard with a message from one of Jackson 's children will all go under the hammer . 
Mr Julien told the Washington Post newspaper that Jackson 's mattress had never been included in the auction as it belonged to the singer 's estate . 
`` Michael Jackson has played a major part in the history of Julien 's Auctions and we would never do anything that is not in the best interests of Michael 's children , his mother or the Estate . 
We will always honor these requests , '' Mr Julien said in a statement . 
`` We want all of our events involving items associated with Michael Jackson to be a good experience for everyone and a celebration of his life and career . ''

Auctioneers Fame Bureau say the footage , which was filmed during Jackson 's Dangerous tour , could fetch up to # 3.8 m. Jackson was apparently unhappy with the quality of footage and gave the only copy to his driver , who is now selling it . 
`` It 's a film that 's frighteningly personal and up-close , '' said Ted Owen from Fame Bureau . 
`` It 's like you 're on stage with Michael Jackson '' .

2011-11-23,"Conrad Murray prosecutors seek four-year sentence With California 's crowded prisons , any actual time in prison could be quite short Prosecutors for the state of California have asked a judge to sentence Conrad Murray to four years in prison , the maximum allowed in his case . 
His lawyers have asked that he is kept on probation , saying he is serving `` a lifetime sentence of self-punishment '' . 
Murray was convicted of the involuntary manslaughter of legendary singer Michael Jackson after a six-week trial . 
A new California law passed to combat prison overcrowding could limit Murray 's sentence . 
Adopted in October , the law sends low-risk prison inmates to county jails . 
Los Angeles County jail officials have been releasing inmates early . 
As well as seeking a four-year term , prosecutor David Walgren also said that Murray , 58 , should pay restitution to Jackson 's children . 
Murray could also lose his licence to practice medicine . 
In a sentencing memorandum delivered to Judge Michael Pastor in advance of a 29 November hearing , Mr Walgren said Murray had shown no remorse for Jackson 's death . 
Michael Jackson died on 25 June 2009 from an overdose of the powerful anesthetic propofol .

2011-11-29,"Katherine Jackson : `` Four years wo n't bring my son back '' Murray was found guilty earlier this month after a six-week trial . 
Judge Michael Pastor told the court that while Murray was legally eligible for probation , he did not think his actions showed he was suitable . 
He said the evidence in the case showed a `` continuous pattern of lies and deceit '' by the disgraced physician . 
The legal teams will return in January 2012 to discuss the prosecution 's request for Murray to pay restitution to Jackson 's family . 
While the prosecution successfully argued for the maximum term , Murray 's lawyers asked that he be kept on probation , saying he is serving `` a lifetime sentence of self-punishment '' . 
Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said he would already be punished for life by being known as `` the man who killed Michael Jackson '' . 
In addition , Murray could still lose his licence to practice medicine . 
As the sentencing hearing began , lawyer Brian Panish , a family friend of the Jackson family , read a statement on their behalf . 
Judge Michael Pastor said Conrad Murray `` repeatedly lied , and he has absolutely no remorse '' Expressing their sense of loss for their `` son , husband , brother and father '' , the statement said the court should impose a suitable sentence . 
`` We respectfully request that you impose a sentence that demonstrates that physicians can not sell their services to the highest bidder and lose sight of their Hippocratic Oath , '' Mr Panish read . 
In a sentencing memorandum delivered to Judge Michael Pastor in advance of Tuesday 's hearing , prosecuting lawyer David Walgren said Murray had shown no remorse for Jackson 's death . 
Defense lawyers argued that Murray had done a huge service to the community throughout his life , including donating supplies to Caribbean doctors and opening a clinic in the poorest area of Houston , Texas . 
`` I do wonder though to what extent the court considers the entirety of a man 's book of life , as opposed to one chapter , '' Mr Chernoff said , adding that Murray could better serve the community on probation . 
Michael Jackson died on 25 June 2009 from an overdose of the powerful anesthetic propofol . 
He had been out of the public eye for several years but was preparing for a series of comeback performances at the O2 arena in London . 
The defense argued that Jackson was a drug addict who caused his own death by giving himself an extra dose of propofol while the cardiologist was out of the room at the star 's rented mansion in Los Angeles . 
Lawyer Brian Panish read a statement on behalf of the Jackson family However , lawyers for Murray dropped a key argument midway through the trial - that the pop superstar had drunk the propofol . 
But they continued to argue that Jackson had somehow dosed himself otherwise . 
There is no law against administering propofol , but the prosecution 's case rested on the argument that Murray was grossly negligent by doing so outside a hospital setting and without the proper monitoring equipment . 
Calling for a four-year prison sentence , Mr Walgren said Conrad Murray had abused the trust placed in him by his patient . 
`` It is the people 's position that prison is warranted . ''

2011-11-29,"By David Willis BBC News , Los Angeles Conrad Murray closes his eyes after he is sentenced There were several things that divided them throughout their client 's six-week trial . 
But the issue that caused the most disagreement between the two key members of Dr Conrad Murray 's legal team was the question of whether the defendant himself should testify on his own behalf . 
Murray 's pugnacious Texas-based lead counsel , Ed Chernoff , was adamant Murray should not take the stand . 
He feared the case raised so many unanswered questions it would be `` open season '' for the prosecution when the time came to cross-examine the physician . 
His flaxen-haired co-counsel Michael Flanagan disagreed . 
As the trial progressed and the evidence against Murray mounted , Mr Flanagan became convinced his client 's only chance of acquittal lay in giving his own version of events . 
As he told the magazine Texas Lawyer shortly after Murray was convicted : `` The elephant in the room was the need for the doctor to explain what he did . '' 
Anything over a couple of dollars he is simply not going to have the ability to pay '' End Quote Michael Flanagan Conrad Murray 's co-counsel It was something Murray himself had clearly been weighing up right until the very last minute . 
As the defense moved to rest its case . 
Judge Michael Pastor reminded the doctor of his right to take the stand and asked him directly whether he wished to reconsider . 
Murray looked at Mr Flanagan and Mr Chernoff in turn and then paused for what seemed like an eternity before replying , `` no '' . 
That he chose to break his silence in a documentary broadcast on the American network MSNBC just a few days after being found guilty clearly irritated Judge Pastor . 
But it was the program 's contents that left the judge almost incandescent . 
Far from appearing remorseful about what had happened to Michael Jackson , Murray almost seemed to regard himself as the victim , declaring defiantly : `` I do n't feel guilty , because I did n't do anything wrong . '' 
Murray passed up a final chance to address the court minutes before his sentencing . 
The judge said the documentary interview was ultimately what persuaded him against granting the accused probation , thereby paving the way to a maximum sentence of four years in prison . 
Jackson 's family is pushing for the astonishing sum of more than $ 100m Mr Flanagan said afterwards that while the judge would have wanted to hear from Murray it was probably too late by then to affect the outcome . 
`` The die was cast a long time ago , '' said the lawyer , ruefully . 
It seems unlikely that either Mr Flanagan or Mr Chernoff will be back in court for a hearing at the end of January to determine how much Murray will have to pay by way of restitution to Michael Jackson 's estate . 
The tension between Mr Flanagan and Mr Chernoff - which even surfaced in that controversial documentary - is one reason they are both reported to be keen to put the Conrad Murray case behind them . 
Jackson 's family is pushing for the astonishing sum of more than $ 100m -LRB- # 64m -RRB- . 
They say that is what he stood to make from the This Is It concerts at London 's O2 arena . 
Jackson had been rehearsing for a series of concerts in London But the fact of the matter is this : Conrad Murray was heavily in debt when he went to work for Michael Jackson , and since Jackson died before he could repay those debts Mr Flanagan believes the family will be lucky to see much of it . 
`` Anything over a couple of dollars he is simply not going to have the ability to pay , '' he said . 
And then there is the question of the lawyer 's own remuneration . 
The Texas Lawyer article revealed that it had `` not been equal to the task '' and quoted Ed Chernoff as saying : `` If Dr Murray had paid me a quarter-of-a-million dollars it -LRB- would have been -RRB- entirely too little considering the amount of work that was involved and the collateral issues that were attached . '' 
The only upside being that - given the high profile nature of the case - future generations of law students may well end up mulling their arguments and discussing their testimony and wondering , perhaps , whether things might have been different had Murray taken the stand .
